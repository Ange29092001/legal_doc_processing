COMPLAINT

Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ) alleges:

SUMMARY

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and
internal control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by Diebold,
Inc. (âDieboldâ), an Ohio company that is a global provider of automated teller machines
(âATMsâ) and bank security systems. From 2005 through 2010, Diebold, through its
agents and subsidiaries, lavished international leisure trips, entertainment, and other
improper gifts on foreign officials to obtain and retain lucrative business with
government owned banks in China and Indonesia. During that same period, Diebold,

through its Russian subsidiary, paid bribes in connection with the sale of ATMs to private
banks in Russia. In all, Diebold made approximately $3 million in illicit payments in

China, Russia, and Indonesia.

2. From 2005 through 2010, through its subsidiary Diebold Financial
Equipment Company (China), Ltd. (âDiebold Chinaâ), Diebold provided international
leisure trips and entertainment to officials of government owned banks in China. This
included trips to Europe, with stays in Paris, Amsterdam, Florence, Rome, and other
European cities, and trips to the United States, with travel to the Grand Canyon, Napa
Valley, Disneyland, Las Vegas, and other popular tourist destinations. Diebold spent
approximately $ 1.6 million on leisure trips, entertainment, and other improper gifts for
government bank officials in China. During this same time period, through its subsidiary
P.T. Diebold Indonesia (âDiebold Indonesiaâ), Diebold spent over $147,000 on leisure
trips and entertainment for officials of government owned banks in Indonesia. Diebold
executives in charge of the companyâs operations in Asia knew of these improper
practices. The illicit payments were falsely recorded in Dieboldâs books and records as

training or other legitimate business expenses.

3. From 2005 through 2008, through its subsidiary Diebold Self-Service Ltd.
(âDiebold Russiaâ), Diebold also paid bribes on the sale of ATMs to private banks in
Russia. These bribes, which totaled approximately $1.2 million, were funneled through a
Diebold distributor in Russia. Diebold Russia executed phony service contracts with its

distributor to hide and falsely record the payments as legitimate business expenses.

4. Diebold, through its agents and subsidiaries, violated Section 30A of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] by providing
leisure travel and other improper gifts to foreign officials to obtain and retain business
with government owned banks in China and Indonesia. Diebold violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have internal controls in place to detect and
prevent those improper payments, and the improper payments to employees of private
banks in Russia. Diebold violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by falsely
recording all of these improper payments as legitimate business expenses in the
companyâs books and records.
JURISDICTION

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and78aa]. Diebold, directly or
indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the
mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

6. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

FACTS

Corrupt Payments in China

15. Diebold sells ATMs and related services to government owned banks in
China. From at least 2005 through 2010, Diebold, through its subsidiary Diebold China,
provided international leisure trips, entertainment, and other improper gifts to foreign
officials for the purpose of obtaining and retaining business with government owned
banks in China. These illicit payments totaled approximately $1.6 million. Examples of
international leisure trips that Diebold provided to government bank officials in China are
described in paragraphs 16-23.

16. In 2005, Diebold paid for a fifteen-day leisure trip to the U.S. for two
officials from Bank A, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. This
trip included travel to Universal Studios and Disneyland in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the
Grand Canyon, Washington, DC, New York City, San Francisco, and Hawaii.

17. In 2006, Diebold paid for a twelve-day trip to Europe for eight officials
from Bank B, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. This was a
leisure and sightseeing trip to Rome, Italy, and Stockholm, Sweden.

18. Also in 2006, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip to Australia and
New Zealand for five officials from Bank C, a bank owned and controlled by the
government of China.

19. In 2007, Diebold paid for a two-week trip to France for thirteen Bank A
employees. While purportedly for training at Dieboldâs offices, the primary purpose of

the trip was leisure.
20.  In2008, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip to Europe for eight
officials of Bank D, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. The trip
included travel to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, Salzburg,
Vienna, Klagenfurt, Venice, Florence, and Rome.

21. Also in 2008, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip to the U.S. for three
officials from Bank E, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China.

22. Also in 2008, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip for ten employees
of Bank F, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. This trip included
travel to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Bali.

23. In 2009, Diebold paid for a two-week trip to the U.S. for twenty-four Bank
A employees that included travel to Chicago; to Las Vegas for sightseeing, a dance show,
and tour of the Grand Canyon; to Los Angeles for a tour of Universal Studios; to San
Diego and San Francisco, which included a tour of Napa Valley.

24. In addition to the leisure trips and entertainment, Diebold China also
provided government bank officials in China with other improper gifts. This included
cash gifts ranging from less than $100 to over $600 that were given to dozens of officials
annually.

25. | Many of the government bank employees who received these leisure trips
and other improper gifts were senior officials who had the ability to influence purchasing
decisions by the banks.

26. Diebold lacked sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent these

illicit payments, many of which were paid to third-parties in China. All of the illicit
payments were falsely recorded in the companyâs books and records as training or other
legitimate business expenses.

27. Diebold executives in charge of the companyâs operations in Asia knew
that Diebold China was providing international leisure trips and other improper gifts to
Chinese bank officials. This included Executive A, Dieboldâs former Executive Vice
President for International Operations, and Executive B, Dieboldâs former Vice President
for the Asia Pacific region. During their tenure at Diebold, Executive A and Executive B
knew that Diebold China was providing international leisure trips, entertainment, and
other improper gifts to Chinese bank officials. At times these executives personally
approved the illicit payments and accompanied government officials on these trips. Even
after these Diebold executives received FCPA training administered by the company in
2007, they took no action to halt these improper practices. Instead, these executives took
further steps to hide the leisure nature of these trips including, on at least one occasion,
providing false information to the companyâs auditors in China.

28. | Other executives at Diebold were on notice of potential corruption issues
at Diebold China. In 2007, a regional government agency in China, the Chengdu
Administration of Industry & Commerce (âCDAICâ), opened an investigation involving,
among other issues, leisure trips and gifts Diebold China had provided to bank officials.
Company executives in China and the U.S. learned of the investigation after a Diebold
field office in Chengdu was raided by authorities. Executives A and B took the lead in
responding to the investigation. Diebold was able to settle the matter with no corruption
charges filed, by paying CDAIC an administrative penalty of 600,000 RMB

(approximately $80,000) for business registration violations. Despite being on notice of
potential corruption issues at Diebold China, Diebold failed to effectively investigate and
remediate these problems.

29. From 2005 through 2010, Diebold generated approximately $265 million
in revenues from sales to government owned banks in China whose officials received

international leisure travel, entertainment, and other improper gifts by the company.

Corrupt Payments in Indonesia

30. Diebold sells ATMs and related products and services to government
owned banks in Indonesia. From 2005 through 2010, through its subsidiary Diebold
Indonesia, Diebold provided leisure trips and entertainment to officials of government
owned banks in Indonesia. Diebold Indonesia spent approximately $147,000 on leisure
trips and entertainment for officials from three government owned banks in Indonesia:
Bank X, Bank Y, and Bank Z. The purpose of providing these leisure trips was to assist
Diebold in obtaining business with these government banks. For example, in one email
exchange in 2009, a Diebold Indonesia employee sought approval from his supervisor to
pay for a leisure trip to Europe for officials of Bank X. The supervisor approved the
payment and responded: âMake this trip successful for upcoming bid too!â

31. As in China, Diebold lacked effective internal controls to detect and
prevent payment for these leisure trips for government bank officials, and the payments
were falsely recorded in Dieboldâs books and records as training costs. During this time
period, Diebold generated approximately $16 million in revenues from sales to
government owned banks in Indonesia whose officials were provided leisure trips and

entertainment by the company.
False Books and Records in Russia

32. During the relevant period, Diebold, through its subsidiary Diebold
Russia, sold ATMs to banks in Russia and Ukraine. In Russia, the company sold ATMs
both directly, and through independent distributors. Between 2005 and 2008, Diebold
Russia paid at least $1.2 million in bribes through Distributor A, a private Russian
company, to employees of privately held banks in Russia. These bribes were funneled
through Distributor A using phony service contracts that Diebold Russia executed with
Distributor A. Distributor A did not perform any services pursuant to these contracts.
Rather, Distributor A passed along the payments it received under these contracts to
employees of the private banks to which Diebold Russia was selling ATMs. Diebold
lacked sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent these illicit payments, all of
which were falsely recorded in the companyâs books and records as legitimate business
expenses.

33. | Asearly as 2007, Diebold was on notice of corruption issues involving
Diebold Russiaâs use of distributors in this region. In 2007, Diebold was seeking to
acquire Distributor B, a Ukrainian company that was an independent distributor of
Diebold products in Ukraine. During due diligence, executives at Diebold, including
Executive A and certain executives in the companyâs legal and corporate development
offices learned that Distributor B had previously made illicit payments to employees of
its bank customers. Diebold was unable to determine whether these illicit payments
involved sales of Diebold products. While Diebold did not move forward with the
acquisition, without taking any further steps to investigate and remediate these corruption

issues, Diebold continued to do business with Distributor B until 2010.
34. Similarly, in 2009, Diebold was seeking to acquire Distributor A, its
largest independent distributor in Russia and Ukraine. During due diligence, evidence
emerged that Distributor A potentially had made illicit payments in connection with its
business. Diebold continued doing business with Distributor A, and continued moving
forward with its planned acquisition. Only later, in 2010, after evidence emerged that
Distributor A had also been funneling bribe payments on behalf of Diebold Russia, did
the company terminate its business dealings and acquisition plan with Distributor A.

SEC Charges Diebold With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-225

Washington D.C., Oct. 22, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an Ohio-based manufacturer of ATMs and bank
security systems with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing officials at government-owned banks with pleasure trips in order
to illicitly win business.

The SEC alleges that subsidiaries of Diebold Inc. in China and Indonesia spent approximately $1.8 million on travel, entertainment, and other
improper gifts for senior officials with the ability to influence the banksâ purchasing decisions. Government-owned bank officials in China and
Indonesia were rewarded with free trips to popular tourist destinations in the U.S. and Europe, and Dieboldâs expenditures were falsely
recorded in the companyâs books and records as legitimate training expenses. Dieboldâs subsidiary in China also provided dozens of
government bank officials with annual cash gifts ranging from less than $100 to more than $600. The SEC further alleges that Diebold
falsified books and records to hide approximately $1.2 million of bribes paid to employees at privately owned banks in Russia.

Diebold has agreed to pay more than $48 million to settle the SECâs charges and resolve a parallel criminal matter announced today by the
U.S. Department of Justice.

âA bribe is a bribe, whether itâs a stack of cash or an all-expense-paid trip to Europe,â said Scott W. Friestad, an Associate Director in the
SECâs Division of Enforcement. âPublic companies must be held accountable when they break the law to influence government officials with
improper payments or gifts.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C., Dieboldâs misconduct occurred from 2005 to 2010. Among the
tourist destinations of U.S. trips were the Grand Canyon, Napa Valley, Disneyland, and Universal Studios as well as Las Vegas, New York City,
Chicago, Washington D.C., and Hawaii. Officials also were treated to European vacations. For example, eight officials at a government-
owned bank in China enjoyed a two-week trip at Dieboldâs expense that included stays in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt,
Munich, Salzburg, Vienna, Klagenfurt, Venice, Florence, and Rome. Destinations of leisure trips for other officials included Australia, New
Zealand, and Bali. In total, Diebold spent approximately $1.6 million to bribe government-owned bank officials in China, and more than
$147,000 to bribe officials at government banks in Indonesia.

The SEC further alleges that from 2005 to 2008, Dieboldâs Russian subsidiary paid approximately $1.2 million in bribes in connection with the
sale of ATMs to private banks in Russia. The bribes were funneled through a distributor in Russia using phony service contracts to hide and
falsely record the payments as legitimate business expenses.

Diebold agreed to pay $22.9 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and appoint an independent compliance monitor in order to
settle the SECâs charges. Diebold consented to a final judgment and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)
(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Diebold agreed to pay an additional $25.2 million fine in the parallel criminal
proceeding.

The SECâs investigation was led by Devon A. Brown and Brian O. Quinn with assistance from Jennifer Baskin of the FCPA Unit and Kristen
Dieter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern
District of Ohio, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
Stryker Corporation, EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ), against Stryker Corporation (âStrykerâ
or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent consents to the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings and to the entry of this Order
Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
Il.
FACTS

On the basis of this Order and the Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. From approximately August 2003 to February 2008 (the ârelevant periodâ),
Stryker made approximately $2.2 million in unlawful payments to various government
employees including public health care professionals (collectively, the âforeign officialsâ) in
Mexico, Poland, Romania, Argentina, and Greece. Stryker incorrectly described these expenses
in the companyâs books and records as legitimate consulting and service contracts, travel
expenses, charitable donations, or commissions, when in fact the payments were improperly
made by Stryker to obtain or retain business. Stryker earned approximately $7.5 million in illicit
profits as a result of these payments.

2. During the relevant period, Stryker incorrectly described unlawful payments to
foreign officials in its accounting books and records in violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) and failed to devise and maintain an
adequate system of internal accounting controls in violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act.

Respondent

3. Stryker is a Michigan corporation with its principal executive offices in
Kalamazoo, Michigan. Stryker manufactures and distributes medical devices and products in
more than 100 countries around the world. Its common stock is registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol âSYK.â Stryker is an âissuerâ within the meaning
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1.

Background

4. During the relevant period, Stryker sold its medical products around the world. In
certain countries, Stryker sold products through wholly-owned regional subsidiaries and through
third-party dealers and distributors. Strykerâs medical products include implants, surgical
equipment, and neurotechnology devices. In 2008, approximately 36% of Strykerâs over $6.7
billion in total sales occurred outside of the United States. The financial results of all of the
Stryker subsidiaries discussed herein were consolidated into Strykerâs financial statements.

5. Strykerâs foreign subsidiaries were organized in a decentralized, country-based
structure, wherein a manager of a particular countryâs operations had primary responsibility for
all business within a given country. During the relevant period, each of Strykerâs foreign
subsidiaries operated pursuant to individual policies and directives implemented by country or
regional management. Stryker had corporate policies addressing anti-corruption, but these

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding

on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2
policies were inadequate and insufficiently implemented on the regional and country level.
Accordingly, Stryker failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the company maintained accountability
for its assets and that transactions were executed in accordance with managementâs
authorization.

Unlawful Payments in Mexico

6. Between March 2004 and January 2007, Strykerâs wholly-owned subsidiary in
Mexico (âStryker Mexicoâ) made three payments totaling more than $76,000 to foreign officials
employed by a Mexican governmental agency (the âMexican Agencyâ) responsible for providing
social security for government employees. Stryker made these payments to win bids to sell its
medical products to certain public hospitals in Mexico. Stryker Mexico earned more than $2.1
million in profits as a result of these illicit payments.

7. These payments were made at the direction of Stryker Mexico employees,
including country level management, and paid to the foreign officials through third party agents.

8. For example, in January 2006, Stryker Mexico learned that the Mexican Agency
was threatening to revoke a contract that Stryker Mexico had won to provide knee and hip
products to certain public hospitals unless Stryker Mexico paid an employee of the Mexican
Agency.

9. As a result of the demand by the employee of the Mexican Agency, Stryker
Mexico directed its outside counsel in Mexico (the âMexican Law Firmâ) to make a payment to
the employee, on Stryker Mexicoâs behalf, in order for Stryker to keep the winning bid.

10. AtStryker Mexicoâs direction, the Mexican Law Firm paid the foreign official
approximately $46,000 on behalf of Stryker Mexico and, as a result of this payment, the Mexican
Agency did not revoke Stryker Mexicoâs status as the winning bidder. The Mexican Law Firm
then invoiced Stryker Mexico for $46,000 for purported legal services rendered, even though no
such services were provided. Stryker Mexico recorded these improper payments as legitimate
legal expenses in its books and records.

11. Stryker Mexico earned over $1.1 million in illicit profits on this contract alone.

12. Stryker Mexico made two additional payments through intermediaries during the
relevant period in much the same fashion, with the purpose of retaining or obtaining business
from public hospitals. The additional payments were in excess of $34,000 and earned Stryker
illicit profits of nearly $1 million.

Unlawful Payments in Poland

13. Between August 2003 and November 2006, Strykerâs wholly-owned subsidiary in
Poland (âStryker Polandâ) made 32 improper payments to foreign officials in Poland for the
purpose of obtaining or retaining business at public hospitals. In total, Stryker Poland made
approximately $460,000 in unlawful payments resulting in more than $2.4 million of illicit
profits.
14. These improper payments were recorded in Strykerâs books and records as
legitimate expenses, including reimbursement for business travel, consulting and service contract
payments, and charitable donations.

15. For example, in May 2004, Stryker Poland paid for a foreign official then
employed as the director of a public hospital in Poland, and her husband, to travel to New York
City and Aruba. Although the official purpose of the trip was for the foreign official to attend a
single-day tour of Strykerâs manufacturing and research facility in Mahwah, New Jersey, Stryker
paid for the coupleâs six-night stay at a hotel in New York City, attendance at two Broadway
shows, and a five-day trip to Aruba before their return flight to Poland.

16. According to Stryker Polandâs records, expenses for the trip, including airfare,
accommodations, and entertainment, totaled approximately $7,000, all of which Stryker Poland
recorded as legitimate travel expenses.

17. Stryker Polandâs internal documents confirm a quid pro quo arrangement between
Stryker Poland and the foreign official. For example, the form containing the schedule for the
foreign officialâs facility tour states that the purpose of the visit was to âstrengthen [the public
doctorâs] conviction that Stryker products are the best solution for her hospital,â and notes that
âwe won a big tender for [one product] (about $350,000) and in this year they are going to buy
our products for $500,000.â

18. Stryker Poland also made additional improper travel payments, payments under
purported consulting agreements totaling approximately $47,000, and gifts and donations of
nearly $400,000, each of which was made to a state-employed healthcare professional for the
purpose of Stryker Polandâs obtaining or retaining the business of public hospitals.

Unlawful Payments in Romania

19. From at least 2003 through July 2007, Strykerâs wholly-owned subsidiary in
Romania (âStryker Romaniaâ) made 192 improper payments to foreign officials totaling
approximately $500,000 in order to obtain or retain business with affiliated public hospitals.

20. Stryker Romania recorded these payments as legitimate sponsorships of foreign
officialsâ attendance, travel and lodging at conferences, and medical events, when in reality they
were illicit payments made to obtain or retain business.

21. As aresult of these payments, Stryker Romania earned more than $1.7 million in
illicit profits.
22. For example, in April 2004, a Stryker Romania salesperson submitted a form to

sponsor a foreign officialâs lodging abroad to attend a conference. The form stated that a
âbusiness benefit[]â from the sponsorship was that, in return, Stryker Romania would receive a
contract for the sale of a particular medical device. In addition, Stryker Romania internally
discussed that the foreign official in question was âwaiting to be confirmed as chief physicianâ at
a public hospital, âthus becoming importantâ for an upcoming bid for a contract. Stryker
Romania recorded the payment as a legitimate business travel expense even though its own
internal documents demonstrated that the payment was made with the purpose of obtaining
future business.

Unlawful Payments in Argentina

23. Between 2005 and 2008, Strykerâs wholly-owned subsidiary in Argentina
(âStryker Argentinaâ) made 392 commission payments, or âhonoraria,â to physicians employed
in the public healthcare system in order to obtain or retain business with affiliated public
hospitals.

24. Unlike traditional honorarium payments that are made in exchange for the
provision of a service (such as making a speech), these honoraria were commissions that were
calculated as a percentage of a total sale to a particular hospital and then paid to the public doctor
associated with the sale. Stryker Argentina routinely made these payments by check to doctors
at rates between 20% and 25% of the related sale.

25. In total, Stryker Argentina made more than $966,500 in improper honoraria
payments during the relevant period, causing Stryker Argentina to earn more than $1.04 million
in profits from the public hospitals with which the doctors were associated.

26. Stryker Argentina booked these payments as commission expenses in an account
entitled âHonorarios Medicos,â when in fact they were unlawful payments made to compensate
doctors for purchasing Stryker products.

Unlawful Payments in Greece

27. In 2007, Strykerâs wholly-owned subsidiary in Greece (âStryker Greeceâ) made a
sizeable and atypical donation of $197,055 to a public university (the âGreek Universityâ) to
fund a laboratory that was then being established by a foreign official who served as a prominent
professor at the Greek University, and was the director of medical clinics at two public hospitals
affiliated with the Greek University.

28. As aresult of this donation, Stryker Greece earned a total of $183,000 in illicit
profits.

29. The donation was made pursuant to a quid pro quo arrangement with the foreign
official, pursuant to which Stryker Greece understood it would obtain and retain business from
the public hospitals with which the foreign official was affiliated, in exchange for making the
donation to the foreign officialâs pet project.

30. In an email from the country manager of Stryker Greece to the regional manager,
the country manager emphasized that she believed the donation to the Greek University was
necessary to secure future sales for Stryker Greece.

31. The country manager wrote: âI think that anything below 30K will leave [the
foreign official] disappointed. He did promise that he would direct his young assistants into
using our trauma and sports medicine products. [The foreign official] is... difficult to get as a
âfriendâ and really tough to have as a disappointed customer.â The regional manager asked,

5
âWhat do we get for the sponsorship â or is it just a gift?â The country manager confirmed the
quid pro quo, stating, âFor the sponsorship we get the Spine business and a promise for more
products in his Department. . .â

32. At a later date, another country manager stated, âI am willing to support what [the
foreign official] is asking for in order to secure the sales he is bringing in.â The regional
manager then approved the request. Soon thereafter, the country manager said of his meeting
with the foreign official: âThings went well (how couldnât theyâI offered him the amount he is
asking for...). ... My impression is that we will start business again.â

33. Stryker Greece made the donation to the Greek University in three installments,
each of which was improperly booked as a legitimate marketing expense in an account entitled
âDonations and Grants.â

IV.
FCPA VIOLATIONS

Books and Records Violations

34. â As detailed above, Strykerâs foreign subsidiaries made over $2.2 million in
unlawful payments to foreign officials that were incorrectly described in the companyâs books
and records. Stryker improperly recorded these payments as legitimate consulting and service
contract payments, business travel expenses, charitable donations, or commissions.

35. As a result of the conduct described above, Stryker violated Section 13(b)(2)(A)
of the Exchange Act, which requires every issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of

the issuer. Public companies are responsible for ensuring that their foreign subsidiaries comply
with Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A).

Internal Controls Violations

36. As detailed above, Stryker and its foreign subsidiaries failed to devise and
maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that the company maintained accountability for its assets and that transactions were
executed in accordance with managementâs authorization. Due to this lack of oversight, Stryker
incorrectly booked over $2.2 million in illicit payments to foreign officials as legitimate
expenses without properly examining the circumstances surrounding the accounting treatment of
these payments. In many instances, even a cursory review of the underlying documentation,
such as travel authorization forms and itineraries, would have revealed the illegitimate nature of
the payments.

37. As a result of the conduct described above, Stryker violated Section 13(b)(2)(B)
of the Exchange Act, which requires all public companies to, among other things, devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
transactions are recorded in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization;
and transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

6
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and to maintain accountability for assets. Public companies are responsible for
ensuring that their foreign subsidiaries comply with Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B).

Strykerâs Remedial Efforts

38. In response to the Commissionâs investigation, Stryker retained outside counsel to
assist Stryker in conducting an internal investigation into Strykerâs compliance with the FCPA in
the jurisdictions that were the subject of the staff's inquiry, as well as in jurisdictions where
issues arose through Strykerâs audit and hotline processes. Stryker voluntarily produced reports
and other materials to the Commission staff summarizing the findings of its internal
investigation. In total, Stryker produced over 800,000 pages of documents at Strykerâs expense,
including courtesy translations of numerous key documents.

39, Since the time of the conduct detailed above, Stryker implemented a company-
wide anti-corruption compliance program, which includes: (a) enhanced corporate policies and
standard operating procedures setting forth specific due diligence and documentation
requirements for relationships with foreign officials, health care professionals, consultants, and
distributors; (b) compliance monitoring and corporate auditing specifically tailored to anti-
corruption, including the hiring of a chief compliance officer and a sizeable full-time dedicated
staff in both its internal audit and compliance functions to ensure FCPA compliance and the
implementation of periodic self-assessments; (c) enhanced financial controls and governance; (d)
expanded anti-corruption training to all Stryker employees; and (e) the maintenance of an Ethics
Hotline which serves as a mechanism for employees to report any actual or suspected illegal or
unethical behavior.

AO. In addition to its internal anti-corruption enhancements, from 2007 through the
present, Stryker engaged a third-party consultant to perform FCPA compliance assessments and
compile written reports for Strykerâs operations in dozens of foreign jurisdictions across the
world at least annually. Stryker voluntarily produced documents that permitted the Commission
staff to assess how Strykerâs internal audit and compliance functions used the results of each of
the assessments to implement additional enhancements to its infrastructure, to target jurisdictions
for future assessments, and to create management action plans in collaboration with local
management.

41. Based on the improvements described above, Stryker has demonstrated a
commitment to designing and funding a meaningful compliance program in order to prevent and
detect violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery laws.

V.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Strykerâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Stryker shall cease and
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of
Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act;

Respondent shall, within ten days of the entry of this Order, pay $13,283,523 to
the United States Treasury, including $7,502,635 in disgorgement, $2,280,888 in
prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil monetary penalty of $3,500,000. If
timely payment is not made, interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of
Practice 600. Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United States
postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission
and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying Stryker as
a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover
letter and check or money order must be sent to Andrew M. Calamari, Regional Director, New
York Regional Office, Securities and Exchange Commission, Brookfield Place, 200 Vesey
Street, Suite 400, New York, NY 10281-1022.

SEC Charges Stryker Corporation With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2013-229

Washington D.C., Oct. 24, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Michigan-based medical technology company
with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when subsidiaries in five different countries bribed doctors, health care professionals,
and other government-employed officials in order to obtain or retain business.

An SEC investigation found that Stryker Corporationâs subsidiaries in Argentina, Greece, Mexico, Poland, and Romania made illicit payments
totaling approximately $2.2 million that were incorrectly described as legitimate expenses in the companyâs books and records. Descriptions
varied from a charitable donation to consulting and service contracts, travel expenses, and commissions. Stryker made approximately $7.5
million in illicit profits as a result of the improper payments.

Stryker has agreed to pay more than $13.2 million to settle the SECâs charges.

âStrykerâs misconduct involved hundreds of improper payments over a number of years during which the companyâs internal controls were
fatally flawed,â said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. âCompanies that allow corruption to occur by failing
to implement robust compliance programs will not be allowed to profit from their misconduct.â

The SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings details improper payments by employees of Strykerâs subsidiaries as far back
as 2003. They used third parties to make the payments in order to win or keep lucrative contracts for the sale of Strykerâs medical
technology products. For example, in January 2006, Strykerâs subsidiary in Mexico directed a law firm to pay approximately $46,000 to a
Mexican government employee in order to secure the winning bid on a contract. The result was $1.1 million in profits for Stryker. The
subsidiary reimbursed the Mexico-based law firm for the bribe and booked the payment as a legitimate legal expense. However, no legal
services were actually provided and the law firm simply acted as a funnel to pay the bribe.

According to the SECâs order, Strykerâs subsidiary in Greece made a purported âdonationâ of nearly $200,000 in 2007 to a public university in
Greece to fund a laboratory that was a pet project of a public hospital doctor. In exchange for the payment, the doctor agreed to provide
business to Stryker.

The SECâs investigation also found that Strykerâs subsidiaries bribed foreign officials by paying their expenses for trips that lacked any
legitimate business purpose. For example, in exchange for the promise of future business from the director of a public hospital in Poland,
Stryker paid travel costs for the director and her husband in May 2004. This included a six-night stay at a New York City hotel, attendance at
two Broadway shows, and a five-day trip to Aruba.

The SECâs order requires Stryker to pay disgorgement of $7,502,635, prejudgment interest of $2,280,888, and a penalty of $3.5 million.
Without admitting or denying the allegations, Stryker agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The SECâs investigation was led by Sharon Binger and Justin Alfano of the New York Regional Office with significant assistance from the
Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ), alleges:

SUMMARY

1. This action arises from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ) by Weatherford International Ltd. (âWeatherfordâ), a Swiss corporation with
operations in Houston, Texas, that is a global provider of equipment and services to the
oil and gas industry.

2. Between at least 2002 and July 2011, Weatherford and its subsidiaries
authorized bribes and improper travel and entertainment intended for foreign officials in
multiple countries to obtain or retain business or for other benefits. Weatherford and its
subsidiaries also authorized illicit payments to obtain commercial business in Congo and

authorized kickbacks in Iraq to obtain United Nations Oil for Food contracts.
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 2 of 25

Weatherford realized over $59.3 million in profits from business obtained through the use
of illicit payments.

3) In addition, from 2002 to 2007, Weatherford and its subsidiaries engaged
in commercial transactions with Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan (âsanctioned countriesâ)
that violated U.S. sanction and export control laws. During the relevant time period,
exporting or re-exporting goods or services from the United States or by a U.S. person to
sanctioned countries was generally prohibited by U.S. law. Certain employees of
Weatherford and its subsidiaries employed various schemes to conceal numerous
commercial transactions with sanctioned countries that violated U.S. sanctions and export
control laws, including creating false books and records. The companyâs improper sales
to sanctioned countries generated over $118 million in revenues and more than $30
million in profits.

4. Weatherford violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] when it authorized and/or paid bribes to foreign
officials in order to obtain or retain business. Weatherford violated Section 13(b)(2)(A)
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78 m(b)(2)(A)] when it created false books and records
to conceal the authorization of bribe payments, kickbacks, and excessive travel and
entertainment, and to conceal transactions with sanctioned countries. Weatherford also
violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78 m(b)(2)(B)] by failing
to have sufficient internal accounting controls in place to detect and prevent the
authorization or payment of bribe payments and the improper sales to sanctioned

countries.

JURISDICTION
5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. Weatherford,
directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
6. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act

[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A. Bribery Schemes in West Africa

1. Angola Cabinda Contract

11s In 2006 and 2007, WSL, a Weatherford subsidiary, retained a Swiss
freight-forwarding and logistics services company (the âSwiss Agentâ) to pay bribes to
an Angolan official so that he would approve the renewal of a lucrative oil services
contract in the Cabinda region of Angola (the âCabinda contractâ). WSL initially had
provided services to a non-governmental oil company pursuant to a five-year contract

awarded in 1998, and the parties had extended the contract in yearly increments between
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 5 of 25

2003 and 2005, with the final one expiring October 31, 2006. Sonangol, the Angolan
state-owned oil company, must approve the award of oil services contracts in Angola,
even with private companies, and a Sonangol Drilling Manager was responsible for
approving the contract award.

12. In late 2005, the Cabinda project was put out for public bid. During the
bid process, the Sonangol Drilling Manager demanded a bribe from a Weatherford area
manager. The area manager refused to pay the bribe and reported in his 2006 ethics
questionnaire response that Weatherford personnel were making payments to government
officials in Angola and elsewhere. Weatherford did not investigate these allegations.

13. In late 2005 or early 2006, the Sonangol Drilling Manager met with a
WSL regional manager and another WSL employee and repeated his demand for a bribe
payment. The employees agreed to pay the Sonangol Drilling Manager $250,000 in
installments in exchange for his approval of the Cabinda contract, as well as additional
payments in order to maintain a good general relationship with Sonangol.

14. | WSL entered into a consultancy agreement with the Swiss Agent. The
original draft of the consultancy agreement used by Weatherfordâs legal department
included an FCPA clause prohibiting the Swiss Agent from giving anything of value,
directly or indirectly, to an official or employee of any government. The Swiss Agent
rejected the clause in an email stating that âin view of the nature of the business I cannot
accept the original wording.â Despite this red flag, no steps were taken to ensure that the
agent was not paying bribes to foreign officials. Instead, Weatherfordâs legal department
in Houston permitted WSL to enter into the consulting agreement without the FCPA

clause, and with an alternate clause simply requiring the agent to âcomply with all
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 6 of 25

applicable laws, rules and regulations issued by any governmental entity in the countries
of business...â

15. | WSL produced sham work orders for consulting services that the Swiss
Agent never performed, and the Swiss Agent, in turn, generated sham invoices for those
same nonexistent services. On some occasions, WSL paid the Swiss Agent before an
invoice was received, or backdated documents. Other times, WSL paid the Swiss
Agentâs invoices that were above the grant of authority level of WSL management. The
Swiss Agent passed those monies on, less a commission, either in cash via WSL
employees, or by wire transfer to the Sonangol Drilling Manager. Moreover, in some
instances, Weatherford paid the Sonangol Drilling Managerâs travel expenses, including a
week-long February 2008 trip to Italy and Portugal that included only one day of
business-related training.

16. | WSL mischaracterized the payments to the Swiss Agent as legitimate
consulting expenses on its books and records. The Sonangol Drilling Manager approved
the award to WSL of the Cabinda contract and it was awarded to WSL in February 2007.
Weatherford earned $11,741,909 in profits from increased pricing obtained from the
Cabinda contract.

2. Angola Joint Venture

17. WSL also engaged in a second bribery scheme in Angola. In June 2004,
Sonangol officials informed Weatherford that it could obtain one hundred percent of the
Angolan well screens market if it created a joint venture with companies they selected
and established a wells screens manufacturing operation in Angola. In 2005, a

Weatherford subsidiary entered into a joint venture in Angola with two local entities
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 7 of 25

selected by the Sonangol officials, one of which was controlled by the Sonangol officials
(âAngolan Company Aâ) and one of which was controlled by the relative of an Angolan
Minister (âAngolan Company Bâ).

18. Angolan Company Aâs named principals included the wife of one of the
Sonangol officials and relatives of other Angolan officials. Angolan Company Bâs
principals included the relative of an Angolan Minister, the relativeâs spouse, and another
Angolan official. The Weatherford subsidiary owned 45% percent of the joint venture,
and Angolan Company A and Angolan Company B owned 45% and 10% respectively.
Neither Angolan Company A nor Angolan Company B provided any personnel, expertise
or capital to the joint venture.

19, In October 2004, the Weatherford executive who was leading the joint
venture effort for Weatherford advised internal counsel in Houston that, â[t]here will be
two parties involved [in the joint venture], Sonangol through an entity named [Angolan
Company A] and a private individual (the [relative of an Angolan Minister]}) through an
entity named [Angolan Company B].â Internal counsel replied, âI am going to have to
get scrutiny with our D.C. trade lawyers since an individual related to the govt entity is
involved...â The Weatherford executive commented, âI hope you are just being cautious
and this isnât a deal killer.â

20. In October 2004, the Sonangol officials traveled to Houston to discuss the
joint venture and sign a letter of intent between âSonangol and or the designeesâ and
Weatherford. The letter of intent provided that Sonangol would negotiate exclusively

with the joint venture for well screens.
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 8 of 25

21. On July 8, 2005, the Weatherford executive and internal counsel met with
two of the Sonangol officials in London to negotiate the final terms of the joint venture.
Afterwards, internal counsel sent an email to a more senior internal counsel, advising that
the successful formation of the joint venture âwill lock up 100% of screen business in
Angola.â Internal counsel also wrote that outside counsel needed to conduct additional
due diligence, noting that two of the persons negotiating on behalf of Angolan Company
A were Sonangol employees and that one of their wives was an owner of Angolan
Company A. The joint venture agreement was signed in September 2005 without
completing the due diligence.

22. The Sonangol officials controlled Angolan Company A and took all
actions on behalf of the entity, including negotiating the joint venture agreement,
attending meetings, providing bank account information, and approving the dividends to
be paid. The relative of the Angolan Minister represented Angolan Company Bâs interest
by attending meetings and negotiating the dividend payments. In April 2006, when a
more senior Weatherford executive asked the Weatherford executive to summarize the
ownership interests in the joint venture, the Weatherford executive replied, â[p]lanned is
45% WFT, 45% [Angolan Company A] (ties back to Sonangol) and [Angolan Company
B] (ties back to ... minister).â

23. Weatherford obtained competitorsâ bid information and its use of the joint
venture guaranteed the award of contracts, which had to be approved by Sonangol. In
2006, after Weatherford learned that a contract had been awarded to a competitor, a

regional manager asked one of the Sonangol officials to intervene. The contract was
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 9 of 25

taken away from the competitor and given to Weatherford. This is memorialized in a
2006 email where one of the Weatherford attendees wrote internal counsel that:

I sat in a meeting this morning with ourselves, [the competitor], and [the

counterparty to the contract] as they told [the competitor] they were cancelling the

$7M Block 4 contract they had received and awarding it to us. I then told [the
counterparty] that we would need another 10-15% to cover our local activities and
they didnât flinch. Every now and then, life gets good.

24. In March 2008, Angolan Company A and Angolan Company B were paid
dividends for 2005 and 2006, and the joint venture paid each partnerâs required
withholding taxes. Angolan Company A received $689,995 and Angolan Company B
received $136,901. Weatherford received $2,036,263 in joint venture profits and $3,484

in profits from the Block 4 contract that was taken from a competitor.

3. Congo
25. In addition to bribery schemes involving Angolan government officials,

WSL made over $500,000 in commercial bribe payments through the Swiss Agent to
employees of a commercial customer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of an Italian energy
company, between March 2002 and December 2008.

26. In 2002, WSL retained the Swiss Agent as its agent to make payments to
employees of the commercial customer in order to obtain and retain business. The Swiss
Agentâs role in the scheme included submitting false invoices and sending payments to
individuals as directed by WSL employees and others. WSL employees created and sent
false work orders to the Swiss Agent. The Swiss Agent, WSL employees and others
knew the services would not be performed and that the work orders were a pretext to

funnel money to the Swiss Agent. The Swiss Agent forwarded the money, less a
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 10 of 25

commission, to the bank accounts of individuals designated by the WSL employees and
others at Weatherford subsidiaries.

27. | WSL mischaracterized the bribe payments as legitimate expenses on its
books and records. Bank account records and a U.S. brokerage account statement show
that among the recipients were two employees of the commercial customer who were
responsible for awarding contracts to WSL. Weatherford obtained profits of $1,304,912
from commercial business in Congo relating to payments made by Swiss Agent.

B. Improper Payments Authorized in the Middle East

 

28. Between 2005 and 2011, another Weatherford subsidiary, WOTME,
awarded improper âvolume discountsâ to a company that served as an agent, distributor
and reseller in the Middle East who supplied Weatherford products to a state-owned and
controlled national oil company, believing that those discounts were being used to create
a slush fund with which to make bribe payments to decision makers at the national oil
company. Weatherford used WOTME, a wholly-owned subsidiary, as the vehicle to sell
its goods and services to the national oil company.

29. Ata meeting in 2001, officials at the national oil company directed
WOTME to sell goods to the company through a particular distributor. Prior to entering
into the contract with the distibutors neither WOTME nor Weatherford conducted any
due diligence on the distributor, despite: (a) the fact that the distributor would be
furnishing Weatherford goods directly to an instrumentality of a foreign government; (b)
the fact that a foreign official had specifically directed WOTME to contract with that
particular distributor; and (c) the fact that executives at WOTME knew that a member of

the countryâs royal family had an ownership interest in the distributor. In late 2001,
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 11 of 25

WOTME entered into a representation agreement with the distributor to sell
Weatherfordâs Completion and Production Systems products to the national oil company.
New agreements, covering additional product lines, were entered into in 2006 and 2009.
When the agreement was renewed in 2009, Weatherford became the direct counterparty
to the agreement.

30. Between 2001 and 2005, Weatherford completed few sales to the national
oil company via the distributor. Beginning in 2005, certain employees of WOTME and
other Weatherford subsidiaries, including regional and product line managers, allowed
the distributor to create a slush fund by providing the distributor with unauthorized
volume discounts and pricing discounts, in addition to the agentâs 5% commission. The
WOTME employees intended that the slush fund would be used for payments to national
oil company officials. The âvolume discountsâ to the distributor were typically between
5-10% of the contact price. The discounts allowed the distributor to accumulate funds
that the employees of WOTME and other subsidiaries believed would be used to pay
bribes to national oil company officials.

31. The volume discounts were not an official contractual item included in
any contract between WOTME and the distributor. WOTME recorded the volume
discounts in a contra revenue account on its general ledger entitled âVolume Discount
Account.â The representation agreements with, and volume discounts for, the distributor
were approved by employees within Weatherford. Weatherford did not perform any due
diligence on the distributor, even after the parent company became the counterparty to the
agreement. No efforts were made to obtain proof that the discounts were provided to the

end user or to otherwise ensure that the payments were not used for illicit purposes.
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 12 of 25

During this time period, the sales of Weatherfordâs expandable sand screen products to
the national oil company significantly increased.

32. | Contemporaneous emails make it clear that employees of WOTME and
other subsidiaries intended, and believed, that the volume discounts were being used to
influence national oil company officials. For example, in September 2006, a manager
employed by a Weatherford U.K. subsidiary proposed to the distributor that they reduce
the volume discounts by âhalf the total that they and their allies were initially wanting.â
In response to this suggestion, the distributor replied: âYes, I agree that we should not
risk our relationship with [national oil company]. However, your suggestion would do
exactly that; it is not purchasing but our friends who will be directly impacted. They and
not purchasing, are in a position to influence the agreement and control the generation,
direction and volume of business we and others receive, and as such the volume discount
may not be subject to negotiations.â

33; In March 2007, Weatherford equipment undergoing a trial test at the
national oil company failed. At the time, there was concern that the equipment failure
would lead to the cancellation of a pending order by the national oil company. A
WOTME manager wrote to another company employee, âI think we need to discuss with
[distributor] and see if [its] team of influential [national oil company employees] can
assist here, Iâm sure they are keen not to loose [sic] their cut of the âvolume
discount?!!!!.â

34. | Weatherford did not permit WOTME or its other subsidiaries to enter into
transactions above set dollar amounts. When the dollar amounts of certain sales

transactions involving the distributor exceeded those set limits, the purchase orders

12
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 13 of 25

showing the volume discount as a line item were approved in the U.S. by Weatherford.
Weatherford employees approved the purchase orders despite the fact that the volume
discounts were not authorized by the representation agreement. Intercompany pricing for
products for sale to the national oil company were also approved by Weatherford
personnel in the U.S and on a number of occasions, an executive of the distributor
traveled to Houston to discuss and assist Weatherford with its business in the Middle
East.

$5. Weatherford granted the distributor in excess of $11.8 million in volume
discounts intended to influence national oil company officials to obtain and retain sales
contracts. Weatherford obtained sales seven of nearly $122 million, and $37.14

million in profits in connection with transactions involving the use of volume discounts.

Gc Improper Travel and Entertainment in Algeria

36. Weatherford also provided improper travel and entertainment to officials
of Sonatrach, an Algerian state-owned company, that were not justified by a legitimate
business purpose.

The improper travel and entertainment to Sonatrach officials include:

. June 2006 trip by two Sonatrach officials to the FIFA World Cup soccer
tournament in Hanover, Germany;

. July 2006 honeymoon trip of the daughter of a Sonatrach official; and

. October 2005 trip by a Sonatrach employee and his family to Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia, for religious reasons that were improperly booked as a
donation.

37. In addition, on at least two other occasions, Weatherford provided
Sonatrach officials with cash sums while they were visiting Houston. For example, in
May 2007, Weatherford paid for four Sonatrach officials, including a tender committee

official, to attend a conference in Houston. Prior to the trip, a Weatherford finance

13
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 14 of 25

executive sent an email to a Weatherford officer requesting $10,000 cash to be advanced
to a WOTME employee without providing any explanation for the cash advance. The
request was approved and a portion of the funds was provided to the tender committee
official. There is no evidence the cash was used for legitimate business or promotional
expenses. In connection with a December 2007 trip by three Sonatrach officials traveling
to Houston, a Weatherford finance employee questioned the propriety of a WOTME
employeeâs request for a $14,000 cash advance in connection with the trip. The finance
employee sent an email stating â... I donât like the looks of this request.... [The WOTME
employee] will be arriving in Houston this Sunday. ... he is being accompanied by three
senior management members of Sonatrach Algeria. And they want cash....â The finance
employeeâs concern was disregarded and the request was ultimately approved at high
levels within Weatherford and a portion of the funds was provided to the officials.

38. In total, Weatherford spent $35,260 on improper travel, entertainment and
gifts for Algerian officials from May 2005 through November 2008 that were recorded in
the companyâs books and records as legitimate expenses.

D. Improper Payments to Albanian Tax Authorities

39. From 2001 to 2006, the general manager and financial manager at a
Weatherford Italian subsidiary, WEMESPA, misappropriated over $200,000 of company
funds, a portion of which was improperly paid to Albanian tax auditors. WEMESPAâs
general manager and financial manager misappropriated the funds by taking advantage of
Weatherfordâs inadequate system of internal accounting controls. They misreported cash
advances, diverted payments on previously paid invoices, misappropriated government

rebate checks and received reimbursement of expenses that did not relate to business
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 15 of 25

activities, such as golf equipment and perfume. The lack of sufficient internal accounting
controls created a risk of improper payments, embezzlement and other unauthorized
access to corporate assets.

40. In July 2006, a co-worker confronted the general manager and financial
manager regarding the misappropriation of government rebate checks payable to
WEMESPA and threatened to expose the misconduct. In January 2007, the general
manager terminated the co-workerâs employment. On the date he was terminated and
again a few weeks later, the co-worker reported the misappropriation of company funds
to the Audit Committee by email, which led to an internal investigation. The general
manager and financial manager returned more than half of the stolen funds to the
company.

41, A memo drafted by the general manager and financial manager in the
months after their co-worker confronted them discussed the misappropriated funds and
indicated that funds were paid to tax auditors in Albania and others for the benefit of
WEMESPA. The general manager, financial manager and the Albania Country Manager
made $41,000 in payments to Albanian tax auditors who questioned details of the
companyâs accounts and demanded payment to close out the audit or speed up the
certification process in 2001, 2002 and 2004.

42. In addition to the cash payments, in 2005, after a regime shift in Albania,
the Country Manager provided three laptop computers for the tax director and two
members of Albaniaâs National Petroleum Agency, which the WEMESPA executives

approved and misrecorded in the books and records.

E. Kickbacks to Obtain Oil for Food Contracts in Iraq
43. The Oil for Food Program (âOFFPâ) provided humanitarian relief for the

Iraqi population due to international trade sanctions. The OFFP permitted the Iraqi
government to sell crude oil and use the proceeds to purchase humanitarian goods. The
proceeds of the oil sales were transferred to an escrow account in New York by the
United Nations 661 Committee to allow for the purchase of humanitarian supplies,
subject to U.N. approval. The intent of this structure was to prevent the supply of cash to
Saddam Hussein. By mid-2000, however, Iraqi ministries had circumvented the
sanctions by requiring suppliers of humanitarian goods to pay a ten percent kickback on
each contract. This kickback was referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee (*ASSFâ);
however, no services were provided.

44. WOTME sold oil equipment through the OFFP to Iraqi ministries. By
mid-2001, WOTMEâs Country Manager in Iraq learned of the ASSF requirement, agreed
to pay kickbacks, and signed at least two side letters to that effect. In order to generate
funds to pay the ASSFs and to conceal those payments, WOTME inflated the price of the
contracts by ten percent before submitting them to the UN for approval. Correspondence
between WOTME and the Iraqi ministries confirms that the Iraqis assessed the ASSF,
which WOTME paid. The ASSF payments were incorrectly recorded as cost of goods
sold on the companyâs books and records.

45. Between February and July 2002, WOTME paid more than $1.4 million in
improper payments on nine contracts. Iraqi ministries also demanded improper âinland
transportation feesâ in an effort to subvert the UN program. WOTME acquiesced to the

Iraqi demands and paid inland transportation fees totaling more than $115,000. Some of

16
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 17 of 25

the invoices paid by WOTME included charges for transportation on items that did not
require inland delivery, charges for delivery to multiple locations when delivery to only
one location was required or references to a port services company that was a front for
the Iraqi government. Weatherford obtained $7,032,376 in profits from this conduct.

F. Weatherford Conceals its Business With Sanctioned Countries in its Books
and Records

46. From at least 2002 to 2007, Weatherford and its subsidiaries employed
various schemes to conceal transactions with Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan (âsanctioned
countriesâ) that violated U.S. sanctions and export control laws. Generally, these laws
prohibit business transactions with sanctioned countries that involve U.S. persons,
companies or goods. Employees of Weatherford and its subsidiaries falsified books and
records to hide sanctioned countries transactions, and Weatherford failed to have
adequate internal accounting controls to prevent or detect the conduct. Weatherford
obtained over $118 million in revenues and $31,646,907 in profits from its business in
sanctioned countries.

47. For example, from 2003 to 2006, WOTME sold products to an Iranian
state-owned entity. Certain Weatherford employees involved in the sales to Iran,
including the contract negotiations, equipment procurement, financing arrangements and
supervision of employees working on the project concealed the transactions in
Weatherfordâs internal emails and correspondence, and books and records by using code
names for Iran such as âDubai across the waterâ and placing key transaction documents
in mislabeled binders. One employee failed to disclose the improper transactions on

Weatherfordâs annual ethics questionnaires.
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 18 of 25

48. In another example, Weatherford maintained a centralized inventory
accounting system in the United States to track procurement and inventory of U.S. goods.
In 2004, employees at WOTME implemented a scheme to fulfill orders destined for
sanctioned countries. The employees created a special prefix in the system to allow them
to procure and track equipment from the United States for Iran, Syria and Sudan while
concealing that the orders were destined for those countries and to conceal that requests
for design work from U.S. engineering personnel were for those countries. The
employees also removed U.S.-origin inventory labels from products and replaced them
with labels that misstated the country of origin. The employees used code words in
internal communications, invoices and journal entries to conceal the true destination of
the products.

49. From 2005 to 2008, employees at a Weatherford Canadian subsidiary
managing business that another Weatherford subsidiary had acquired created false
shipping documents and used code words to make it appear that products were being
shipped to âBarcelona, Venezuelaâ rather than Cuba. They also created a false shipping
destination called Barcelona, Venezuela in Weatherfordâs computer inventory and
accounting system. As a result, the Cuba transactions were masked on Weatherfordâs
shipping documents, asset tracking system, invoices, and journal entries as Barcelona,
Venezuela transactions.

50. Weatherford also removed serial numbers from products to conceal the
destination of its U.S. goods. Further, U.S. executives of Weatherford participated in the
acquisition of two foreign companies that did business in Iran while attempting to mask

their involvement through the use of code names for Iran. Weatherford also took steps to
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 19 of 25

conceal in its transaction records the role of U.S. persons in obtaining business in
sanctioned countries.

Sh. During the relevant period, Weatherford did not have adequate internal
accounting controls over transactions in sanctioned countries. The company lacked
adequate export control training programs. The legal department, in conjunction with the
internal audit group, conducted an annual âBthies Questionnaireâ in an effort to capture
ethics and compliance violations. However, there is no evidence that the company had a
protocol in place for performing further investigation into allegations of unethical or
corrupt conduct included in the Ethics Questionnaire responses. Further, in 2005, when
Weatherford responded to comment letters from the SECâs Division of Corporation
Finance regarding the companyâs Form 10-K for the year 2003, Weatherford asserted that
it was in full compliance with and had established corporate policies on U.S. economic
sanctions and export control laws.

G. Misconduct During the Investigation and Subsequent Remediation Efforts

52. Certain conduct by Weatherford and its employees during the course of
the Commission staff's investigation compromised the investigation. These activities
involved the failure to provide the staff with complete and accurate information, resulting
in significant delay. In one instance, the staff sought information concerning the Iraq
Country Manager who signed letters agreeing to pay bribes to Iraqi officials during the
Oil for Food Program. The staff was informed that the Country Manager was missing or
dead when, in fact, he remained employed by Weatherford. In at least two instances,

email was deleted by employees prior to the imaging of their computers. On another

19
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 20 of 25

occasion, Weatherford failed to secure important computers and documents and allowed
potentially complicit employees to collect documents subpoenaed by the staff.

53. Subsequent to the misconduct, Weatherford greatly improved its
cooperation and engaged in remediation efforts, including disciplining employees
responsible for the misconduct, establishing a high level Compliance Officer position,
significantly increasing the size of its compliance department, and conducting numerous
anti-corruption reviews in many of the countries in which it operates.

H. Anti-Bribery Violations

54. | Weatherfordâs conduct in the Middle East and Angola violated Section
30A of the Exchange Act. From 2005 through 2011, Weatherford authorized $11.8
million in payments to national oil company officials through a distributor intended to
wrongfully influence national oil company decision makers to obtain and retain business.
Weatherford also violated Section 30A when it retained the Swiss Agent to funnel bribes
to a Sonangol official to obtain the Cabinda contract. Weatherford similarly violated
Section 30A by bribing other Sonangol officials via the joint venture in return for
contracts and preferential treatment. Employees of state-owned and controlled oil
companies are âforeign officialsâ as the term is defined in the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§78dd-
1(Â£)(1)(A). Operationally, Weatherfordâs subsidiaries and their employees and third
parties acted as agents of Weatherford in connection to the conduct described above, and
certain Weatherford employees and employees of its subsidiaries were directly involved
in or consciously disregarded the high probability that the distributor might misuse the

payments to improperly influence foreign officials. Weatherford, its employees, and its

20
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 21 of 25

agents made use of the mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce
corruptly in furtherance of the bribery schemes in the Middle East and Angola.
L Failure to Maintain Books and Records

55. Weatherford, directly and through its subsidiaries, also violated Exchange
Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) when it made numerous payments and engaged in many
transactions that were incorrectly described in the companyâs books and records. In the
Middle East, for example, the money given to a distributor to be used as bribes was
reflected in Weatherfordâs books and records as legitimate volume discounts. In
Angola and Congo, payments to foreign officials and others were described as
legitimate consulting fees rather than bribe payments. Payments to Sonangol executives
through the joint venture were misrecorded as legitimate dividend payments.

56. Weatherford employees created false accounting and inventory records in
an effort to hide illegal sales to Cuba, Syria, Sudan and Iran. The financial statements
of the subsidiaries involved in the conduct and their books and records were
consolidated into the financial statements of the parent company issuer.

J. Failure to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

57. Weatherford violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing
to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The
violations were widespread and involved conduct at Weatherfordâs headquarters as well
as at numerous subsidiaries. Executives, managers and employees throughout the
organization were aware of the conduct, which lasted a decade. Weatherford paid
millions of dollars to consultants, agents and joint venture partners without adequate due

diligence. Weatherford approved cash payments to Algerian officials traveling to

21
Case 4:13-cv-03500 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 11/26/13 Page 22 of 25

Houston without any justification for the payments. Employees made payments to agents
without regard to grants of authority and, on some occasions, without even receiving an
invoice. In Italy, internal accounting controls were ineffective, allowing executives to
embezzle and pay bribes for years.

58. In the Middle East, the company failed on several occasions to perform
due diligence on the distributor it used, despite the fact that the agent was imposed upon
them by a national oil company official and would be selling to a government entity. The
use of large volume discounts was not routinely reviewed. For years, Weatherford failed
to have any internal controls over their accounting of transactions in sanctioned countries,
and invoices, purchase orders, shipping documents and inventory records were falsified
to conceal the conduct. Weatherford also failed to provide FCPA or export compliance
training. While Weatherford did require certain employees to complete a yearly ethics
questionnaire seeking instances of alleged misconduct, Weatherford failed to investigate

or even review the responses.

","Press Release

SEC Charges Weatherford International With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-252

Washington D.C., Nov. 26, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged oilfield services company Weatherford
International with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by authorizing bribes and improper travel and entertainment for foreign
officials in the Middle East and Africa to win business, including kickbacks in Iraq to obtain United Nations Oil-for-Food contracts.

The SEC alleges that Weatherford and its subsidiaries falsified its books and records to conceal not only these illicit payments, but also
commercial transactions with Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Sudan that violated U.S. sanctions and export control laws. Weatherford failed to
establish an effective system of internal accounting controls to monitor risks of improper payments and prevent or detect misconduct. The
company reaped more than $59.3 million in profits from business obtained through improper payments, and more than $30 million in profits
from its improper sales to sanctioned countries.

Swiss-based Weatherford, which has substantial operations in Houston, has agreed to pay more than $250 million to settle the SECâs charges
and parallel actions by the Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section, U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas, Department of
Commerceâs Bureau of Industry and Security, and Department of Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control.

âThe nonexistence of internal controls at Weatherford fostered an environment where employees across the globe engaged in bribery and
failed to maintain accurate books and records,â said Andrew Ceresney, co-director of the SECâs Enforcement Division. âThey used code
names like âDubai across the waterâ to conceal references to Iran in internal correspondence, placed key transaction documents in mislabeled
binders, and created whatever bogus accounting and inventory records were necessary to hide illegal transactions.â

Kara N. Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit, added, âWhether the money went to tax auditors in Albania or
officials at the state-owned oil company in Angola, bribes and improper payments were an accustomed way for Weatherford to conduct
business. While the profits may have seemed bountiful at the time, the costs far outweigh the benefits in the end as coordinated law
enforcement efforts have unraveled the widespread schemes and heavily sanctioned the misconduct.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Houston, the misconduct occurred from at least 2002 to 2011. In Angola, for
example, Weatherfordâs legal department permitted its subsidiary to use an agent who insisted that an FCPA clause be omitted from the
consultancy agreement. The company took no steps to determine whether the agent was paying bribes to foreign officials, and the agent
used sham work orders and invoices to pay bribes that ensured the renewal of a lucrative oil services contract for Weatherford in Angola.
The same agent made illicit payments to obtain commercial contracts for Weatherford in Congo. The company also allowed its subsidiary to
enter into a joint venture agreement with companies whose beneficial owners included Angolan oil company officials and a relative of an
Angolan Minister in order to win business. A Weatherford employee reported in a 2006 ethics questionnaire that Weatherford personnel were
making payments to government officials in Angola and elsewhere, but the company failed to investigate.

The SECâs complaint also alleges that Weatherford failed to perform due diligence on a distributor suggested by an official at a national oil
company in the Middle East. From 2005 to 2011, Weatherford and its subsidiaries awarded more than $11.8 million in improper âvolume
discountsâ to the distributor - money intended for the creation of a slush fund to pay foreign officials.

According to the SECâs complaint, the misconduct went beyond the use of agents or other third parties. Weatherford provided improper
travel and entertainment to officials of a state-owned company in Algeria with no legitimate business purpose. For example, Weatherford
paid for a 2006 FIFA World Cup trip by two of the officials, the July 2006 honeymoon of an officialâs daughter, and an October 2005 religious
trip to Saudi Arabia by an official and his family that was improperly recorded as a donation in Weatherfordâs books and records.
Weatherfordâs Middle East subsidiary also made more than $1.4 million in improper payments to obtain nine contracts under the Oil-for-Food
program in 2002. Iraqi ministries demanded improper âinland transportation feesâ in an effort to subvert the UN program. Weatherfordâs
subsidiary complied with the Iraqi demands and paid more than $115,000 in fees despite invoices that included charges inconsistent with the
actual deliveries. Weatherford obtained more than $7 million in profits from the misconduct.

The SEC further alleges that managers at Weatherfordâs subsidiary in Italy flouted the lack of internal controls and misappropriated more
than $200,000 in company funds, some of which was improperly paid to Albanian tax auditors. The managers misreported cash advances,
diverted payments on previously paid invoices, misappropriated government rebate checks, and received reimbursement for such purchases
as golf equipment and perfume that did not relate to business activities.

According to the SECâs complaint, Weatherford employees created false accounting and inventory records from 2002 to 2007 to hide the
illegal commercial sales to Cuba, Syria, Sudan, and Iran. During this time period, exporting or re-exporting goods or services from the U.S. to
these sanctioned countries was prohibited. The falsified financial statements and books and records of Weatherford subsidiaries involved in
the misconduct were consolidated into the financial statements of the parent company.

The SECâs complaint alleges that Weatherford violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the
FCPA, specifically Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Weatherford agreed to pay
$65,612,360.34 to the SEC in the global settlement, including a $1.875 million penalty assessed in part for lack of cooperation early in the
investigation. Weatherford agreed to pay $87 million in criminal fines to the Department of Justice for the FCPA violations, and $100 million
to the other three agencies for the sanctions violations. The company also must comply with certain undertakings, including the retention of
an independent compliance monitor for 18 months and self-reporting to the SEC staff for an additional 18 months.

The SECâs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Tracy L. Price, Kelly G. Kilroy, and Stanley Cichinski of the FCPA Unit as
well as Natalie Lentz and Robert Dodge. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Department, Commerce Department, Treasury
Department, and U.S. Attorneyâs Office in Houston.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ) alleges the following

against Defendant Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (âADMâ or the âCompanyââ):

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This matter involves violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by ADM. At certain times between
2002 and 2008, Alfred C. Toepfer, International G.m.b.H. (âACTI Hamburgâ) and its affiliate,
Alfred C. Toepfer, International (Ukraine) Ltd. (âACTI Ukraineâ) paid approximately $22
million to two third-party vendors so that they could pass on nearly all of that money as bribes to
Ukrainian government officials to obtain over $100 million in accumulated value added tax
(âVATâ) refunds. These payments were recorded by ACTI Hamburg and ACTI Ukraine in their
books and records as insurance premiums and other business expenses. ADM indirectly owns a
majority of ACTI Hamburg and ACTI Ukraine through its 80% interest in Alfred C. Toepfer
International B.V. (âACTTâ), and in 2002, ADM began consolidating ACTIâs financial results

into its financial statements.
2. In order to disguise the purpose of these improper payments, ACTI Hamburg and
ACTI Ukraine made certain payments for export-related services and insurance premiums to
third parties, but, in fact, nearly all of these payments were intended to be passed on through
these third parties as bribes to Ukrainian government officials in exchange for obtaining VAT
refunds for and on behalf of ACTI Ukraine.

3. ACTIâs conduct went unchecked by ADM, and ACTI continued to make these
improper payments for several years. ADMâs anti-bribery compliance controls in existence at
the time were insufficient in that they did not deter and detect these payments. ACTI Hamburg
and ACTI Ukraine created inaccurately described reserves in their books and records,
manipulated commodities contracts that were kept open for an extended period of time,
structured payments to avoid detection, and created fictitious insurance contracts to hide from
ADM and others the payments to third-parties to secure VAT refunds in Ukraine.

4. Due to the consolidation of ACTIâs financial results, which included these
inaccurately characterized payments, into ADMâs books and records, ADM violated Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ). ADM violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to

detect and prevent the illicit payments.
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page3of14

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§$78u(d) and 78aa]. ADM has, directly or indirectly, made use of
the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a
national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses of
business alleged in this Complaint.

6. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15

U.S.C. Â§ 78aa], because ADMâs headquarters are located in Decatur, Illinois.

DEFENDANT

7. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company is a large agricultural processing company
based in Decatur, Illinois. It is incorporated in Delaware. ADMâs common stock is registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act and is traded on the New York

Stock Exchange under the symbol âADM.â

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

8. Alfred C. Toepfer, International G.m.b.H. (âACTI Hamburgââ) is a German
limited lability company that is headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. The business of ACTI
Hamburg, which operates thirty-six sales offices worldwide, specializes in agricultural
commodities and processed products. ADM initially acquired an indirect interest in ACTI in

1983 and, by 2002, obtained an indirect 80% ownership interest in ACTI Hamburg.
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page4of14

9. Alfred C. Toepfer International (Ukraine) Ltd. (âACTI Ukraineââ) is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of ACTI, and an affiliate of ACTI Hamburg. It is headquartered in Kiev,

Ukraine and has six branch offices in addition to a facility at the Port of Odessa.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

Background
10. ADM first acquired an interest in ACTT in 1983 and, by 2002, indirectly owned

80% of its stock. Beginning in 2002, ADM consolidated ACTIâs financial results into ADMâs
financial statements. Accounting, tax, and sales personnel at ACTI reported to ACTIâs
management, not to personnel within the corresponding functions at ADM. ADM had only five
representatives on ACTIâs ten-person supervisory board during the relevant period, and ACTTâs
operations were largely independent from ADMâs operations. In fact, at times, ADM and ACTI
Hamburg traders competed against each other in bidding to fulfill grain contracts.

11. ACTI Hamburg sourced commodities in Ukraine through ACTI Ukraine in order
to make sales to customers outside of the Ukraine. ACTI Hamburg used ACTI Ukraine to fill
customer orders for agricultural commodities located in Ukraine. After ACTI Ukraine purchased
the agricultural products within the Ukraine, it arranged for their export from the Port of Odessa
on the Black Sea. ACTI Hamburgâs trading desk in Hamburg arranged the sales on behalf of
ACTI Ukraine. ADM did not implement controls that required pre-clearance or monitoring of
ACTI Hamburgâs relationship with third-party agents in the Ukraine or transactions involving
the Ukraine government.

12. Ukraine imposed a 20% VAT on goods purchased in Ukraine. If the goods were
exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on

those goods. At certain times from 2002 until 2010, however, the Ukrainian government

4
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page5of14

determined to delay paying the VAT refunds owed or did not make any refund payments at all.
During these years, ACTI Ukraine accumulated large receivables for VAT refunds, including as
high as approximately $46 million at certain periods.

13. At certain times during the relevant period, in order to obtain VAT refunds, ACTI
Hamburg and ACTI Ukraine made improper payments, which were generally 18%-20% of the
corresponding VAT refunds, to two third-party vendors so that they could pass on nearly all of
the money to Ukrainian government officials with knowledge of and approval by ACTI
Hamburg. ACTI Ukraine and ACTI Hamburg used these two third-party vendors to cover up
bribes paid to Ukrainian government officials in exchange for those officialsâ assistance in
helping ACTI Ukraine obtain VAT refunds. ACTIâs books and records improperly recorded the
payments as insurance premiums or other business expenses.

ADM Executives Are Told Charitable Donations Are Made to Secure ACTI Ukraineâs
VAT Refunds

14. In or around July 2002, executives from ACTI Hamburg traveled to ADMâs
headquarters in Decatur, Illinois for business meetings. In one of those meetings, these ACTI
executives met with executives from ADMâs tax department and discussed ACTI Ukraineâs
ability to recover VAT refunds and the way in which ACTI Ukraine was accounting for the
write-down of those refunds. During this discussion, the ACTI Hamburg executives stated that
the way in which ACTI Ukraine was recovering its VAT refunds was by making charitable
donations.

15. On or about October 4, 2002, an ADM executive in the tax department sent an e-
mail to the head of an international tax organization and stated, âOne of our affiliates operates in
the Ukraine. In order to recover 100% of their input VAT they have to pay 30% of the amount

to local charities. The charitable amount is not deductible. Is this common practice in the

5
ae)
out :

Ukraine? Is this legal? Is there any way to avoid having to pay the 30% in order to get the
100%?â

16. On October 8, 2002, the ADM executive referenced in paragraph [5 above
forwarded the e-mail referenced in paragraph 15 above to two other executives in ADMâs tax
department, and stated that he had spoken with the head of the international tax organization and
that âthe bottom line is that ACTI is getting screwed by someone...[T]he consensus is that there
is no way legislation could require this situation. H could very well be a local tax authority issue.
ly ACTI would like we could have the [tax organization] address this issue with the local tax
authorities as a policy matter and not a company specific issue. They could raise the issue with
some of the Tax Service headquarters people who the [tax organization] has had over to the US
and with the Deputy Minister of Finance. The [tax organization] could give ACT a veil to hide
behind as this issue is addressed with the authorities and, hopefully, results in a fix for ACTT.
Let me know what ACTI thinks about this.â

17. On or about October 24, 2002, one of the ADM executives who received the e-
mail referenced in paragraph 16 above sent an e-mail to the other two executives on the e-mail
referenced in paragraph 16 above, summarizing the follow-up meeting he had with executives
from ACTI Hamburg. In the e-mail, the ADM executive outlined six tax issues relating to ACTI
entities that he discussed with ACTI Hamburg executives, including the VAT refunds for ACTI
Ukraine, and stated, â[ACTTâs] current procedure is to book the input VAT as a balance sheet
receivable and write it down on average of 30% a year (depending on interest rates, devaluation,
etc.)... According to [an executive at ACTI Hamburg] it is a fight every year [to get VAT
refunds] but overall he thinks that Toepfer has good contacts with politicians and the authorities

in the Ukraine. I mentioned that [the ADM executive referenced in paragraph 16 above] had
some good contacts as well within business organizations operating in the Ukraine like the [the
tax organization referenced in paragraph 16 above] which also might be helpful. The issue here
is that [the ACTI Hamburg executive] to[ld] me that the Toepferâs contacts usually ask for
âdonationsâ. I asked him how much were these âdonationsâ and he answered that they could be
up to 20% of the VAT receivable. My concern is that these âdonationsâ are not legal, not
deductible, are Subpart F income and against ADM corporate compliance policy. Additionally, I
am not sure that the way they are booking this VAT receivable is US GAAP. I am open to
suggestions on how to proceed on this.â The Internal Revenue Code defines âSubpart F incomeââ
in the case of any controlled foreign corporation to include, among other things, the âamounts of
any illegal bribes, kickbacks, or other payments . . . directly or indirectly to an official,
employee, or agent in fact of a government... ,â certain insurance income, foreign base
company income, certain foreign source income, including that attributable to the earnings and
profits of the foreign corporation, as well as certain income derived from any foreign country.

26 U.S.C. Â§952(a). The Internal Revenue Code further specifies that the âpayments referred to
in paragraph (4) [of Subpart F] are payments which would be unlawful under the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977... .â 26 U.S.C. Â§952(a).

18. In or around 2004, ADM established a joint venture in Ukraine between ADM
and a Swiss company. In connection with the creation of the joint venture, ADM retained an
accounting firm to perform an analysis of tax issues that might arise.

19. On or about April 30, 2004, ADMâs accounting firm sent a letter to two ADM
executives, stating: âThere are a number of structures aimed at facilitation of VAT refund that
are widespread in Ukraine....Some of these structures bear legal risks and may be challenged by

the tax authorities. Moreover, structures normally envisage that the exporter obtains VAT refund
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page8of14

with a 30-40% discount. From the discussions during our meeting in Odessa we learned that [the
Swiss joint venture company] currently implements various VAT optimization structures at its
subsidiary and plans to have them implemented at the joint venture. Since these structures often
lack transparency and sometimes have tax and legal risks attached, we believe there is a need to
perform a more detailed analysis of their applicability at the joint venture.â

20. Given ADMâs insufficient anti-bribery compliance policies and procedures at the
time, it did not prevent or detect the improper payments made by ACTI Ukraine or ACTI

Hamburg.

ACTIâs Improper Payments through a Shipping Company Vendor

21. At certain times between 2002 and 2008, ACTI Ukraine and ACTI Hamburg
made payments to a stevedoring company in the port of Odessa (the âShipping Companyââ) so
that it could pass on nearly all of those payments to Ukrainian officials in order to obtain VAT
refunds on behalf of ACTI Ukraine. Senior managers at ACTI Ukraine conspired with the owner
of the Shipping Company to artificially inflate invoices. The amount by which the invoices
between the Shipping Company and ACTI Hamburg were inflated represented a sum that was
available for the Shipping Company to pass to Ukraine government officials.

22. When ACTI Hamburg received the invoice from the Shipping Company, it
withheld payment of a portion of the amount in the invoice, and then upon receiving the relevant
VAT refund, ACTI Hamburg released the funds to the Shipping Company.

23. Certain executives at ACTI Hamburg were aware that the payments to and
arrangement with the Shipping Company were improper. In April 2002, an employee of ACTI

Hamburg cautioned his colleagues not to look too deeply into the Shipping Company: âFor
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page9of14

reasons that you know (if you donât know them, I will explain them to you verbally), we will
have to continue to make paymentsâ to the Shipping Company.

24. In April 2005, the ACTI Ukraine general manager reported to senior ACTI
Hamburg officers that VAT claims had been aggregated in the escrow account used to pay the
Shipping Company. He also reported that part of the purpose of the escrow account was to avoid
scrutiny of the overpayments by ADM internal auditors and the ACTI Hamburg shareholders.

25. By the end of 2006, the receivable for Ukrainian VAT on ACTI Ukraineâs books
had grown to approximately $40 million. In a report dated December 29, 2006, ACTI
Hamburgâs Chairman wrote that âthe situation in Ukraine has again returned to what we found
several years ago,â and that companies would once again have to bid for VAT refunds, a process
he described as a âbidding orgy.â

26. Between January and March 2007, ACTI Hamburg paid the Shipping Company
$8,236,269 in order to obtain VAT refunds totaling $46,366,107. The refunds generally arrived
within a day or two of the payments to the Shipping Company. ACTI Hamburg disguised these

payments on its books and records as prepayments for feed barley.

ACTI Maintains Inaccurate Entries on its Books Related to VAT Recovery

27. In January 2007, the size of the VAT receivable had risen to approximately $40
million dollars. The 20% reserve for this receivable drew the attention of ADMâs European
finance and controlling department. The department questioned ACTI on the basis for setting
aside such a large reserve.

28. After ACTI Ukraine received a VAT refund on or about January 23, 2007, an
ADM controller asked an executive at ACTI Hamburg what the basis of the VAT refund was. In

response, an ADM executive relayed from an executive at ACTI Hamburg that âthis [VAT
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page 10of14

refund] is from 2005 . . . but the collection came with a price, the price being the government
required a âdepreciationâ (as [the ACTI Hamburg Vice Chairman] called it) of 18%.....basically,
the companies owed the money from the government had to write off 18% to collect this amount.
He is hopeful there is no more âdepreciationâ but he does not have a clear picture as to when the
payment might be received or how the govt will settle the balance. [T]he amount received will
not go towards the P&L as it is simply reducing the receivable and the amount written off
appears to be lost to the govt.â

29. Based on this exchange with ACTI Hamburg, ADM understood that ACTI
Ukraine expected to obtain VAT refunds resulting from negotiating a legal settlement with the
Ukrainian government, which would cause the receivable and corresponding reserve to decrease.
ACTI Hamburg, in efforts to avert ADMâs concerns regarding the size of the receivable, advised
that ACTI Ukraine, as part of the settlement, agreed to waive 18% of its VAT receivable. ACTI
Hamburg, however, never disclosed that the 18% figure represented approximately the amount
of improper payment provided to third-party vendors so that nearly all of those monies could be

provided to Ukrainian government officials.

ACTI Ukraine Makes Payments to a Third-Party by Using Fake Insurance Premiums

30. Between February 2007 and August 2008, the ACTI Ukraine general manager
organized a scheme through which ACTI Ukraine used a Ukrainian insurance company (the
âInsurance Companyââ) to funnel improper payments to Ukrainian government officials. ACTI
Ukraine arranged for the Insurance Company to falsely bill it for crop insurance, which the
Insurance Company never intended to honor, adjusting the premiums to be roughly 20% of the
VAT refund. ACTI Ukraine improperly recorded the payments as insurance premiums in its

books and records.

10
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page1lof14

31. The improper payments through phony insurance contracts were made with the
knowledge and approval of senior officials at ACTI Hamburg. In February 2008, ACTI
Hamburgâs Vice Chairman reported to ACTIâs Chairman that the ACTI Ukraine general
manager âJust got an offer from someone to set up VAT refunds at a price 3% lower than the
current arrangement. . . . insurance money will now be used for VAT refunds.â

32. In addition, senior ACTI officials knew the insurance arrangement was not
legitimate, as evidenced by e-mail communications between the ACTI Ukraine CFO and ACTI
Hamburg senior managers, stating: âThe contracts completed here, either sporadically or ad hoc,
include no kind of insurance protection, but serve the purpose only of generating a commission
for the VAT repayment in this manner. Regardless of the wording of the contract, the content is
completely different. That means that in case of conflict, claims could not be made
successfully.â

33. In all, ACTI Ukraine paid approximately $9 million through the Insurance
Company for refunds totaling $44 million, which were received between March 29, 2007 and
August 1, 2008. ACTI Ukraine misrepresented these payments as insurance premiums in its

books and records.

ADMâs Discovery and Subsequent Remedial Measures

34. In mid-2008, after becoming aware of these insurance expenses, ADM controllers
questioned ACTI executives regarding these expenses, particularly the basis for the accounting
treatment of these expenses. An ACTI Ukraine employee disclosed to its outside auditors that
the insurance payments were, in fact, made to secure VAT refunds. After ADM controllers

received this information, ADMâs legal and compliance departments took action, which led to an

11
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page 12of14

immediate investigation in which ADM ultimately uncovered ACTIâs various schemes to secure
VAT refunds.

35. Following discovery of these payments, ADM immediately retained outside
counsel to conduct an internal investigation. As a result of the investigation, using its authority
as majority shareholder through the ACTI supervisory board, ADM terminated certain ACTI
executives. ADM then voluntarily conducted a world-wide risk assessment and corresponding
global internal investigation, made numerous presentations to the Department of Justice and
Securities and Exchange Commission, made current and former employees available for
interviews, produced documents without subpoena, and implemented early and extensive

remedial measures.

ADMâs Violations

36. ACTI Hamburg and ACTI Ukraine characterized their improper payments to the
Shipping Company and the Insurance Company as insurance premiums and other business
expenses even though nearly all of those payments were intended to be used for payment to
Ukrainian government officials. Due to the consolidation of ACTIâs financial results into
ADMâs, ADMâs financial records also failed to reflect the true nature of the payments.

37. Between 2002 and 2008, ADMâs anti-corruption policies and procedures relating
to ACTI were decentralized and did not prevent improper payments by ACTI to third-party
vendors in the Ukraine or ensure that these transactions were properly recorded by ACTI. In this
respect, ADM failed to implement sufficient anti-bribery compliance policies and procedures,
including oversight of third-party vendor transactions, to prevent these payments at ACTI

Hamburg and ACTI Ukraine.

12
2:13-cv-02279 #1 Page 13of14

38. Through its various schemes, ACTI Ukraine and ACTI Hamburg paid roughly
$22 million in improper payments to obtain more than $100 million in VAT refunds earlier than
they otherwise would have. Getting these VAT refunds earlierâbefore the Ukraine endured a
brief period of hyperinflationâgave ACTI Ukraine a business advantage resulting in a benefit to

ADM of roughly $33 million.

SEC Charges Archer-Daniels-Midland Company With FCPA
Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-271

Washington D.C., Dec. 20, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland
Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

An SEC investigation found that ADMâs subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the
release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records
as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made
approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries.

ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SECâs charges. In a parallel action, the U.S.
Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has
agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines.

âADMâs lackluster anti-bribery controls enabled its subsidiaries to get preferential refund treatment by paying off foreign government
officials,â said Gerald Hodgkins, an associate director in the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âCompanies with worldwide operations must
ensure their compliance is vigilant across the globe and their transactions are recorded truthfully.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine
imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT
already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not
make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADMâs Ukraine affiliate reached as
high as $46 million.

The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADMâs subsidiaries in Germany and
Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20
percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping
company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an
insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for
several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine.

The SECâs complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ADM consented
to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354. The
final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its
FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC took into account ADMâs cooperation
and significant remedial measures, including self-reporting the matter, implementing a comprehensive new compliance program throughout
its operations, and terminating employees involved in the misconduct.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Nicholas A. Brady and supervised by Moira T. Roberts and Anita B. Bandy. The SEC appreciates the
assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
ALCOA INC.,, EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I,

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Alcoa Inc. (âAlcoaâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent consents to the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over the Respondent and the subject matter of these proceedings, and to the entry of
this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderââ), as set
forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds' that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (the âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd] by Respondent Alcoa Inc. (âAlcoaâ) concerning alumina
sales to Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. (âAlbaâ), an aluminum manufacturer owned primarily by the
Kingdom of Bahrain.

2. Between 1989 and 2009, Alcoa of Australia (ââAofAâ) and Alcoa World Alumina
LLC (âAWAâ) (collectively, the âAWAC Subsidiariesâ) retained a consultant to act as their
middleman in connection with sales of alumina to Alba and knew or consciously disregarded the
fact that the relationship with the consultant was designed to generate funds that facilitated
corrupt payments to Bahraini officials. The consultant was paid a commission on sales where he
acted as an agent and received a markup on sales where he acted as a purported distributor. On
sales where the consultant acted as a purported distributor, no legitimate services were provided
to justify the role of the consultant as a distributor. The consultant used these funds to enrich
himself and pay bribes to senior government officials of Bahrain.

3. The commission payments to the consultant and the alumina sales to the
consultant made pursuant to the distribution agreements were improperly recorded in Alcoaâs
books and records as legitimate commissions or sales to a distributor and did not accurately
reflect the transactions. The false entries were initially recorded by the AWAC Subsidiaries
which were then consolidated into Alcoaâs books and records. During the relevant period, Alcoa
also lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect the improper payments.

Respondent

4. Alcoa is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. Until 2006, Alcoaâs principal place of business was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
in the Western District of Pennsylvania. In 2006, Alcoa moved its principal place of business to
New York, New York. Alcoa issues and maintains a class of publicly traded securities registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange.

5. Alcoa is a global provider of primary aluminum and fabricated aluminum. Alcoa
is also a global provider of smelter grade alumina, the raw material that is supplied to smelters to

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
produce aluminum. Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite it extracts from its global mining
operations. Alcoa operates worldwide through subsidiaries and affiliated entities in North
America, Asia, Australia, Europe, South America, Africa and the Caribbean.

Other Relevant Entities and Persons

6. Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (ââAWACâ) is an unincorporated global
bauxite mining and alumina refining enterprise formed in 1995 between Alcoa and Alumina
Limited (âAluminaâ), the majority and minority owners of AWAC, respectively. AWAC
operates through a number of affiliated enterprise companies, including AofA and AWA, with
each enterprise company being owned by Alcoa and Alumina in proportion to their respective
ownership interests in the AWAC enterprise. In matters of strategy and policy, the AWAC
enterprise companies receive direction and counsel from a âStrategic Councilâ that is chaired by
Alcoa. Alcoa controls the Strategic Council and as such the operations and personnel of AWAC
report to Alcoa personnel in New York.

7. Alcoa of Australia Limited (âAofAâ) is the AWAC enterprise company that
owns and operates AWACâs bauxite mining and alumina refining assets in Australia. AofAâs
principal place of business was located in Melbourne, in the state of Victoria, Australia, until
1996, and is now located in Perth, in the state of Western Australia. AofA owns and operates
mines in Western Australia that extract bauxite, which AofA then processes into smelter grade
alumina in refineries it owns and operates. AofA sells the smelter grade alumina to aluminum
smelters it owns in the state of Victoria as well as to customers and alumina traders around the
world. AofA maintains bank accounts in the United States. AofAâs books, records, and
accounts are consolidated into Alcoaâs books and records and reported by Alcoa in its financial
statements.

8. Alcoa World Alumina LLC (âAWAâ) is a Limited Liability Company formed
under Delaware law, which maintains its principal place of business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
in the Western District of Pennsylvania. AWA owns and operates (either directly or indirectly)
bauxite mining and alumina refining assets in North America, Europe, South America, and the
Caribbean. AWA is an AWAC enterprise company. Beginning in or around 2000, executives at
AWAâs offices in Pittsburgh and Knoxville, Tennessee, assumed primary responsibility for all of
AWACâs relationships with global alumina customers, including Alba. AWA personnel
responsible for these functions reported to Alcoa personnel in New York.

9. Consultant A is an international middleman who resides in London and is a
citizen of Canada, Jordan, and the United Kingdom. Consultant A had close contacts with
certain members of Bahrainâs Royal Family, some of whom were senior officials in the
Government of Bahrain. Consultant A met with Alcoa executives to discuss matters relating to
the relationship with Alba. Consultant A operates through many shell companies, including
Alumet Ltd (âAlumetâ) and AA Alumina and Chemicals Ltd (ââAAACââ).

10. Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. (âAlbaâ) is an aluminum smelter operating in
Bahrain. At the relevant times, the state holding company of the Kingdom of Bahrain, the
Mumtalakat, which was controlled by the Bahrain Ministry of Finance, held 77 percent of the

3
shares of Alba. The Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (âSABICâ), which is majority-owned
and controlled by the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, held a twenty percent
minority stake in Alba, and three percent of Albaâs shares were held by a German investment
group. The majority of profits earned by Alba belonged to the Mumtalakat, though part of the
profit was permitted to be used by Alba for its operations. The Bahrain Ministry of Finance had
to approve any change in Albaâs capital structure and had to be consulted on any major capital
projects or contracts material to Albaâs operations. Members of the Royal Family of Bahrain and
representatives of the government sat on the Board of Directors of Alba, controlled its Board,
and had primary authority in selecting its chief executive officer and chief financial officer.

Facts

11. â Alcoaâs global bauxite and alumina refining business (the âAlumina Segmentâ) is
part of the Global Primary Products group, one of Alcoaâs three business lines. The Alumina
Segment operationally consists of multiple subsidiaries. During the relevant time period, the
Alumina Segment reported to the global head of the Global Primary Products group, who was an
executive of Alcoa and reported directly to Alcoaâs CEO.

12. Alcoa exercised control over the Alumina Segment, including the AWAC
Subsidiaries. Alcoa appointed the majority of seats on the AWAC Strategic Council, and the
head of Global Primary Products served as its chair. Alcoa and AofA transferred personnel
between them, including alumina sales staff; Alcoa set the business and financial goals for
AWAC and coordinated the legal, audit, and compliance functions of AWAC; and the AWAC
Subsidiariesâ employees managing the Alba alumina business reported functionally to the global
head of the Alumina Segment. Alba was a significant alumina customer for Alcoaâs Alumina
Segment and during the relevant period, members of Alcoa senior management met both with
Alba officials and Consultant A to discuss matters related to the Alba relationship, including a
proposed joint venture between Alcoa and Alba. During this time, Alcoa was aware that
Consultant A was an agent and distributor with respect to AofAâs sales of alumina to Alba and
that terms of related contracts were reviewed and approved by senior managers of Alcoaâs
Alumina Segment in the United States.

13. From at least 1989 to 2009, AofA supplied alumina to Alba through a series of
multi-year contracts. During this period, Alba was one of Alcoaâs largest alumina customers
purchasing a total of nearly 19 million metric tons beginning with an annual volume of 300,000
metric tons increasing to 1.6 million metric tons.

14. Beginning in approximately 1989, AofA retained Consultant A to assist in long-
term contract negotiations with Alba and Bahraini government officials, including the
negotiation and execution of a new long-term alumina supply agreement in 1990 (the â1990
Supply Agreement.â)

15. By 1996, Consultant A was playing a significant role in the relationship between
the AWAC Subsidiaries and Alba. Around this time, Alba complained to the AWAC
Subsidiaries that it was paying an above-market price for alumina. AofA learned that Alba was
seeking to increase its alumina supply requirements from 600,000 metric tons a year up to

4
970,000 metric tons a year, and that other major global suppliers of alumina were seeking to
capture these additional requirements. The AWAC Subsidiariesâ sales team decided that, to
âcomply with business norms in the Middle East[,]â the AWAC Subsidiaries would propose
supplying some of Albaâs alumina through Alumet, which was one of Consultant Aâs shell
companies, which would pay the ârequired commission.â An AofA manager proposed using
Consultant A as the intermediary because Consultant A was âwell versed in the normal ways of
Middle East businessâ and âwill keep the various stakeholders in the Alba smelter happy....â

16. Despite the red flags inherent in this arrangement, AofAâs in-house counsel
approved the arrangement without conducting any due diligence or otherwise determining
whether there was a legitimate business purpose for the use of a third party intermediary.

17. The AWAC Subsidiariesâ sales managers traveled to London in August 1996 to
meet with Consultant A to discuss this proposal to route some of AofAâs alumina through
Consultant Aâs company for resale to Alba. Upon their return to Australia, an AWA manager
told other members of the AWAC Subsidiaries sales team that:

It feels like we subsidise the Sheiks and end up with a 5 year outcome that is about
$10-15/t lower than the average of the rest of our business.

18. In September 1996, the AWAC Subsidiariesâ sales managers traveled to London
to meet with Alba and Consultant A and agreed to an addendum to the 1990 Supply Agreement
(â1996 Addendumâ). Under the 1990 Agreement, AofA was supplying 600,000 metric tons per
year to Alba under a formula pricing structure (as opposed to a âmarketâ-based price). Under
the 1996 Addendum, AofA agreed to supply Alba with an additional 285,000 metric tons per
year through one of Consultant Aâs shell companies using a âmarketâ-based price that resulted in
pricing that was, at times, actually below market and allowed Consultant A to mark up his sales
of alumina to Alba.

19. Employees at AWA and AofA either knew or were willfully blind to the high
probability that Consultant A would use his commissions and markup to pay bribes. For
example, in an internal document memorializing the negotiations surrounding the 1996
Addendum, a member of AofAâs alumina sales staff wrote:

The methodology of business in the Middle East is a complex web of interactions
that are necessarily difficult to understand to disguise the payment of commissions.
We have in the past maintained a position of paying our agent a 1% commission on
the basis of the agent work that he has done for us. We have also, however, been
asked by Alba to supply some cargoes through other intermediaries, including our
agent, on various occasions and we can only assume at the purpose this
serves....Given that we want to supply the full tonnage going into the future we
need to fix on the best methodology for us given the commission requirements and
the contract structure.

20. The sales staff was concerned that the monies paid to Consultant A come from
Consultant Aâs markup on sales to Alba, rather than through increased commission payments.

5
An AWA manager was concerned that the monies paid to Consultant A not come at AofAâs
expense and that the sales to Consultant A âprotect our position.â

21. In 2001, with the coming expiration of the 1990 Supply Agreement and 1996
Addendum, AWA approached Alba to extend and expand the alumina supply relationship. Alba
agreed to extend the existing supply relationship (â2001 Extensionâ). Following the 2001
Extension, AofA stopped selling alumina directly to Alba; all AofA alumina destined for Alba
was instead routed through AAAC, which was one of Consultant Aâs shell companies.

22. In 2004, AofA entered into another distribution agreement with Consultant A that
involved the sale of up to 1.6 million metric tons of alumina to Alba every year through AAAC,

which was a shell company of Consultant A. This arrangement lasted until approximately
December 31, 2009.

23. The 2001 Extension and 2004 purported distributorship agreements facilitated the
corrupt payments by allowing Consultant A to impose an inflated markup on his purported sales
of alumina to Alba and used the markup from those sales to enrich himself and pay bribes to
senior government officials of Bahrain.

24. From 2002 to 2004, AWA caused Consultant A and AAAC, one of his shell
companies to receive in excess of $79 million in markups on alumina sales to Alba. Consultant
A also received a commission under the terms of the 2001 Extension. The 2001 Extension

provided for a commission of 0.125 percent of all payments made by Consultant A to AofA for
alumina. From 2002 to 2004, AofA paid Consultant A âcommissionsâ of $493,509.

25. In 2002, Alcoa was attempting to negotiate a joint venture with Alba, in which
Alcoa would supply Alba with alumina from the AWAC systemâs refineries, and, in exchange,
Alba would supply Alcoa with aluminum. Alcoa retained Consultant A to act as a consultant
and to privately lobby a Bahraini government official on behalf of Alcoa, and Alcoa entered a
consulting agreement with Consultant A pursuant to which Consultant A would receive an $8
million âsuccess feeâ based on limited specified negotiation âadvice and assistance to Alcoaâ if
the joint venture were successful.

26. As part of the negotiations, Alcoa proposed a joint venture structure that
contemplated supplying alumina to Alba through a distributor. On or about March 26, 2003, an
in-house attorney in Alcoaâs legal department raised questions about the deal, and requested an
explanation for the role of the distributor. On or about March 27, 2003, AWA sales executive
responded that â[t]he Distributorship rol[e] is something the Bahrain Government wantsâ and
that Alcoa âshouldnât get too involved with how the Distributor and the Government interact.
We are currently selling the alumina we supply to Alba through a Distributor.â

27. On September 15, 2003, Alcoa and Alba agreed to a Memorandum of
Understanding (âMOUâ) outlining an equity investment by Alcoa in Alba and providing for
alumina to be sold to the Government of Bahrain, as majority shareholder of Alba, âdirectly or
through an associated company of Alcoa satisfactory to GoB [Government of Bahrain] and
Alcoa.â The MOU was approved by the same Bahraini government official on behalf of Alba

6
that Consultant A had been hired to lobby. Subsequently, the joint venture negotiations fell
through, and Consultant A was never paid the $8 million success fee.

28. By the summer of 2004, AofA was supplying approximately one million metric
tons of alumina annually to Alba, but Consultant Aâs companies were invoicing Alba for the
shipments. Unlike a true distributorship, Consultant Aâs companies never took possession of the
alumina, assisted with the shipping arrangements, or otherwise performed any legitimate services
for either the AWAC Subsidiaries or Alba. The only function the shell companies provided was
to invoice Alba for the shipments at a significant markup.

29. Albaâs obligations under pre-existing supply arrangements with AofA were set to
expire at the end of 2004. In the summer of 2004, AWA sought to secure a new long term
alumina supply agreement with Alba. On or around August 5, 2004, Alcoa management was
advised by a former senior Alcoa executive who had a relationship with Consultant A that if they
attempted to negotiate a direct contractual relationship between AofA and Alba, rather than
negotiate a supply arrangement through Consultant A and one of his companies, some or all of
Albaâs business could be lost to another alumina supplier.

30. On or about August 19, 2004, AWA management met with Consultant A at
Consultant Aâs London Office to discuss using Consultant Aâs companies âas Alcoaâs exclusive
distributor in the region.â On or about August 22, 2004, an AWA executive negotiating with
Consultant A sent an email documenting with more specificity certain items that were discussed
at the meeting. Among them, the executive noted that â[W]e agreed to supply [Consultant A]
with pricing indications for supply to [AAAC, one of Consultant Aâs shell companies] by 8/24 so
he can have these for his meeting with [a Bahraini official]. We mentioned pricing close to
14%.â The email also noted that â[a Bahraini official] is holding on to publishing [Albaâs]
alumina tender [to the market] until he has further discussions with [Consultant A] on 8/29.â
The pricing terms per metric ton of alumina that the AWA executive quoted to Consultant A at
the meeting in London were less than the pricing terms for Alba that an AWA sales executive
had quoted to a Bahraini official approximately one month earlier.

31. On or around September 29, 2004, AWA facilitated Consultant Aâs tendering a
bid to supply Alba up to 1.6 million metric tons of alumina for ten years commencing in 2005.
On or about October 8, 2004, the in-house attorney responsible for supporting the alumina
business suggested terminating the consulting agreement that Alcoa had entered with Consultant
A in connection with the proposed joint venture, as âthe terms of [Consultant Aâs] current
engagement created a lot of anxiety in the organization.â However, an AWA executive decided
that the consultancy agreement should not be terminated until AofA had secured a new long-term
alumina supply agreement with Alba.

32. On or about November 1, 2004, a Bahraini official caused Alba to accept
Consultant Aâs tender offer for a ten-year supply of alumina. On or about December 31, 2004,
AofA entered a sham ten-year distributorship agreement with AAAC, one of Consultant Aâs
shell companies to purportedly supply annually up to 1.78 million metric tons of alumina for sale
to Alba from 2005 to 2014 (the â2005 Alba Supply Agreementâ). It was actually AofA that
would continue shipping the alumina directly from its refineries in Western Australia to Alba.

7
33. On or about March 4, 2005, a representative of Consultant A sent another
Bahraini government official a final, unexecuted contract for the purported supply agreement
between Consultant A and Alba. On or about June 8, 2005, the final agreement negotiated
between Consultant A and Alba was signed by that government official on behalf of Alba. The
agreementâs effective date was January 1, 2005, and its term was through December 31, 2014.
The agreement provided that Consultant A would supply Alba with 1.508 million metric tons of
alumina in 2005 and 1.6 million metric tons of alumina thereafter for each remaining contract
year. Alba was required to bear the cost of shipping and insurance.

34. For sales of alumina to Alba, Consultant A did not receive payment until after
Consultant A was bound to pay AofA. Given the discrepancy in the timing of payment,
Consultant A sought a line of credit from Alcoa to cover the cost of alumina shipments to Alba
until Alba remitted payment to Consultant A. Alcoaâs policies and procedures required its
customers to submit financial statements for an extension of credit. Consultant A, however,
refused to provide financial statements to Alcoaâs credit department. Nevertheless, in or around
December 2004, senior management of AWA invoked an override procedure that resulted in an
Alcoa executive approving a $23 million line of credit to Consultant Aâs companies.

35. Thereafter, in each of contract years 2005 through 2009, Alcoa continued to grant
overrides to extend increasing credit lines to Consultant Aâs purported distributorships. By
2007, Alcoa was extending a credit line of $58 million. During this period, Alcoa granted
Consultant A credit lines that were significantly greater than those granted by Alcoa to any other
third party. By facilitating the extension of credit to Consultant A, AWA enabled the purported
distributorship scheme by allowing Consultant A to defer paying AofA for the multi-million
dollar shipments of alumina to Alba until Consultant A received payment from Alba.

36. From 2005 through 2009, AWA caused Consultant A to receive in excess of $188
million on the markup of alumina sales to Alba. This money was transferred from the initial
accounts in which payment from Alba was received through various bank accounts controlled by
Consultant A, including accounts in the name of shell companies.

37. The AWAC Subsidiaries knew or consciously disregarded the fact that Consultant
A was inserted into the Alba sales supply chain to generate funds to pay bribes to Bahraini
officials. Ultimately, these funds facilitated at least $110 million in corrupt payments to Bahraini
officials. The vast majority of those funds were generated from the markup between the price
Consultant A sold to Alba and the price that AofA sold to Consultant A. Those funds were also
generated from the commissions that AofA paid to Consultant A.

38. The recipients of the corrupt payments included a senior Bahraini official,
members of the board of directors of Alba, and senior management of Alba. Examples of the
corrupt payments include:

e In August 2003, Consultant Aâs shell companies made 2 payments totaling $7 million to
accounts for the benefit of a Bahraini government official who Consultant A had been
retained to lobby. Two weeks later, Alcoa and Alba signed an agreement in principle to
have Alcoa participate in Albaâs plant expansion.

8
e In October 2004, Consultant Aâs shell company paid $1 million to an account for the
benefit of that same government official. Shortly thereafter, Alba agreed in principle to
Alcoaâs offer for the 2005 Alba Supply Agreement.

e In or around the time of the execution of the final 2005 Alba Supply Agreement,
Consultant A-controlled companies paid another Bahraini government official and/or his
beneficiaries $41 million in three payments.

Legal Standards and Violations

C. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act of omission the person knew or
should have known would contribute to such violation.

FCPA Violations

D. Under Section 30A(a) of the Exchange Act it is unlawful for any issuer, officer,
director, employee, or agent of such issuer or any stockholder thereof acting on behalf of the
issuer, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly
in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any
money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any
foreign official or any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of
value will be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official for the
purposes of (i) influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in his official capacity, (11)
inducing such foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such
official, or (111) Securing any improper advantage in order to assist such issuer in obtaining or
retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

E. Additionally, under Section 30A(g) of the Exchange Act it is unlawful for any
issuer organized under the laws of the United States, or a State, territory, possession, or
commonwealth of the United States or for any United States person that is an officer, director,
employee, or agent of such issuer or a stockholder thereof acting on behalf of such issuer, to
corruptly do any act outside the United States in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to
pay, or authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or
authorization of the giving of anything of value to any of the persons or entities set forth in
paragraphs (1), (i), and (111) of subsection (a) of this section for the purposes set forth therein,
irrespective of whether such issuer or such officer, director, employee, agent, or stockholder
makes use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in furtherance of
such offer, gift, payment, promise, or authorization.
F, This Order contains no findings that an officer, director or employee of Alcoa
knowingly engaged in the bribe scheme. As described above, Alcoa violated Section 30A of the
Exchange Act by reason of its agents, including subsidiaries AWA and AofA, indirectly paying
bribes to foreign officials in Bahrain in order to obtain or retain business. AWA, AofA, and their
employees all acted as âagentsâ of Alcoa during the relevant time, and were acting within the
scope of their authority when participating in the bribe scheme. As described above, Alcoa
exercised control over the Alumina Segment, including the AWAC Subsidiaries. Alcoa
appointed the majority of seats on the AWAC Strategic Council, and the head of the Global
Primary Products group served as its chair. Alcoa and AofA transferred personnel between
them, including alumina sales staff; Alcoa set the business and financial goals for AWAC and
coordinated the legal, audit, and compliance functions of AWAC; and the AWAC Subsidiariesâ
employees managing the Alba alumina business reported functionally to the global head of the
Alumina Segment. Alba was a significant alumina customer for Alcoaâs Alumina Segment and
during the relevant period, members of Alcoa senior management met both with Alba officials
and Consultant A to discuss matters related to the Alba relationship, including a proposed joint
venture between Alcoa and Alba. During this time, Alcoa was aware that Consultant A was an
agent and distributor with respect to AofAâs sales of alumina to Alba and that terms of related
contracts were reviewed and approved by senior managers of Alcoaâs Alumina Segment in the
United States.

G. Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].

H. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(1) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization;
(11) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

I. As described above, Alcoa violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by
improperly recording the payments, to Consultant A, as agent commissions when the true
purpose of these payments was to make corrupt payments to Bahraini officials. Alcoa violated
Section 13(b)(2)(A) when Alcoa recorded the sales to Consultant A as a distributor. The false
entries were initially recorded by the AWAC Subsidiaries which were then consolidated and
reported by Alcoa in its consolidated financial statements. Alcoa also violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) by failing to devise and maintain sufficient accounting controls to detect and prevent
the making of improper payments to foreign officials.

10
Alcoaâs Remedial Efforts

J. Alcoa made an initial voluntary disclosure of certain of these issues to the
Commission and Department of Justice in February 2008, and thereafter Alcoaâs Board of
Directors appointed a Special Committee of the Board of Directors to oversee an internal
investigation by independent counsel. Alcoaâs counsel regularly reported on the results of the
investigation and fully cooperated with the staff of the Commission.

K. Alcoa also undertook extensive remedial actions including: a comprehensive
compliance review of anti-corruption policies and procedures, including its relationship with
intermediaries; enhancing its internal controls and compliance functions; developing and
implementing enhanced FCPA compliance procedures, including the development and
implementation of policies and procedures such as the due diligence and contracting procedure
for intermediaries; and conducting comprehensive anti-corruption training throughout the
organization.

Criminal Plea Agreement

Respondentâs subsidiary AWA has agreed, with the United States Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, Fraud Section, to plead guilty for criminal conduct relating to certain of the
findings in the Order.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Alcoaâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Alcoa cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A)
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act;

B. Respondent shall pay disgorgement of $175,000,000. A portion of Respondentâs
disgorgement obligation in the amount of $14,000,000 shall be deemed satisfied by Respondentâs
payment of $14,000,000 in forfeiture as part of Respondentâs resolution with the United States
Department of Justice (âDOJâ) filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania. In the event that
Respondentâs resolution with DOJ requires a forfeiture payment less than $14,000,000, the
Respondent acknowledges that its disgorgement obligation will be credited up to the amount of the
payment required by Respondentâs resolution with DOJ, with the remaining balance due and
payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission within 14 days of payment pursuant to
Respondentâs resolution with DOJ. In light of the impact of the disgorgement payment upon
Respondentâs financial condition and its potential to substantially jeopardize Alcoaâs ability to
fund its sustaining and improving capital expenditures, its ability to invest in research and
development, its ability to fund its pension obligations, and its ability to maintain necessary cash

11
reserves to fund its operations and meet its liabilities, Respondent shall pay the disgorgement in
five equal payments based upon the following schedule:

Amount Date Due

$32,200,000 January 9, 2014
$32,200,000 January 9, 2015
$32,200,000 January 9, 2016
$32,200,000 January 9, 2017
$32,200,000 January 9, 2018

If timely payment of disgorgement is not made within 14 days of when due, additional interest
shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600. Payment must be made in one of the following
ways:

(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will
provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the
SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United States postal
money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-
delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Alcoa Inc. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy
of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Charles Cain, Deputy Unit Chief,
FCPA Unit, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F St., NE,
Washington, DC 20549.

By the Commission.

SEC Charges Alcoa With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-3

Washington D.C., Jan. 9, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. with violating
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries repeatedly paid bribes to government officials in Bahrain to maintain a key
source of business.

An SEC investigation found that more than $110 million in corrupt payments were made to Bahraini officials with influence over contract
negotiations between Alcoa and a major government-operated aluminum plant. Alcoaâs subsidiaries used a London-based consultant with
connections to Bahrainâs royal family as an intermediary to negotiate with government officials and funnel the illicit payments to retain
Alcoaâs business as a supplier to the plant. Alcoa lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect the bribes, which were improperly
recorded in Alcoaâs books and records as legitimate commissions or sales to a distributor.

Alcoa agreed to settle the SECâs charges and a parallel criminal case announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice by paying a total of
$384 million.

âAs the beneficiary of a long-running bribery scheme perpetrated by a closely controlled subsidiary, Alcoa is liable and must be held
responsible,â said George Canellos, co-director of the SEC Enforcement Division. âIt is critical that companies assess their supply chains and
determine that their business relationships have legitimate purposes.â

Kara N. Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit added, âThe extractive industries have historically been exposed to a
high risk of corruption, and those risks are as real today as when the FCPA was first enacted.â

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Alcoa is a global provider of not only primary or fabricated
aluminum, but also smelter grade alumina - the raw material that is supplied to plants called smelters that produce aluminum. Alcoa refines
alumina from bauxite that it extracts in its global mining operations. From 1989 to 2009, one of the largest customers of Alcoaâs global
bauxite and alumina refining business was Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. (Alba), which is considered one of the largest aluminum smelters in the
world. Alba is controlled by Bahrainâs government, and Alcoaâs mining operations in Australia were the source of the alumina that Alcoa
supplied to Alba.

According to the SECâs order, Alcoaâs Australian subsidiary retained a consultant to assist in negotiations for long-term alumina supply
agreements with Alba and Bahraini government officials. A manager at the subsidiary described the consultant as âwell versed in the normal
ways of Middle East businessâ and one who âwill keep the various stakeholders in the Alba smelter happy...â Despite the red flags inherent in
this arrangement, Alcoaâs subsidiary inserted the intermediary into the Alba sales supply chain, and the consultant generated the funds
needed to pay bribes to Bahraini officials. Money used for the bribes came from the commissions that Alcoaâs subsidiary paid to the
consultant as well as price markups the consultant made between the purchase price of the product from Alcoa and the sale price to Alba.

The SECâs order finds that Alcoa did not conduct due diligence or otherwise seek to determine whether there was a legitimate business
purpose for the use of a middleman. Recipients of the corrupt payments included senior Bahraini government officials, members of Albaâs
board of directors, and Alba senior management. For example, after Alcoaâs subsidiary retained the consultant to lobby a Bahraini
government official, the consultantâs shell companies made two payments totaling $7 million in August 2003 for the benefit of the official.
Two weeks later, Alcoa and Alba signed an agreement in principle to have Alcoa participate in Albaâs plant expansion. In October 2004, the
consultantâs shell company paid $1 million to an account for the benefit of that same government official, and Alba went on to reach another
supply agreement in principle with Alcoa. Around the time that agreement was executed, the consultantâs companies made three payments
totaling $41 million to benefit another Bahraini government official as well.

The SECâs cease-and-desist order finds that Alcoa violated Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Alcoa will pay $175 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, of which $14 million will be satisfied by the companyâs payment of forfeiture in
the parallel criminal matter. Alcoa also will pay a criminal fine of $209 million.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice as well as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Australian Federal Police, Ontario Securities Commission, Guernsey Financial Services Commission,
Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority, Norwegian @KOKRIM, United Kingdom Financial Control Authority, and Office of the Attorney General
of Switzerland.

In the Matter of ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
HEWLETT-PACKARD SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
COMPANY, EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Hewlett-Packard Company (âHP Co.â or
Respondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferââ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent consents to the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings and to the entry of this Order
Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderââ) as set forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds' that:

Summary

1. From approximately 2003 to 2010 (the ârelevant periodâ), HP Co.âs indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries in Russia, Mexico and Poland, by and through their employees,
agents and intermediaries, made unlawful payments to various foreign government officials to
obtain business. These payments were also falsely recorded in the subsidiariesâ books and
records and, ultimately, in HP Co.âs books and records. In Russia, HP Co.âs subsidiary (âHP
Russiaâ) made payments through HP Russiaâs agents to a Russian government official to retain a
multi-million dollar contract with the federal prosecutorâs office. The payments were made
through shell companies engaged by the agents to perform purported services under the contract.
In Poland, certain agents or employees of HP Co.âs Polish subsidiary (âHP Polandââ) provided
gifts and cash bribes to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with Polandâs national
police agency. In Mexico, HP Co.âs Mexican subsidiary (âHP Mexicoâââ) made improper
payments to a third party in connection with a sale of software to Mexicoâs state-owned
petroleum agency. HP Co. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, âHPââ) earned
approximately $29 million in illicit profits as a result of this improper conduct.

2. The payments and improper gifts to government officials made directly or
through intermediaries were falsely recorded in the relevant HP subsidiariesâ books and records
as legitimate consulting and service contracts, commissions, or travel expenses. In fact, the true
purpose of the payments and gifts was to make improper payments to foreign government
officials to obtain lucrative government contracts for HP. During the relevant period, HP lacked
sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent the improper payments and gifts made by
executives and representatives of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.

Respondent

3. Hewlett-Packard Company, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of
business in Palo Alto, California, manufactures personal computers, printers and software and
provides related information technology services. HP Co.âs common stock is registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York Stock
Exchange.

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Other Relevant Entities

4. ZAO Hewlett-Packard A.Q. (âHP Russiaâ) is an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of HP Co. headquartered in Moscow, Russia. HP Russiaâs books, records and
accounts are consolidated into HP Co.âs books and records and reported by HP Co. in its
financial statements.

5. Hewlett-Packard Polska, Sp. z 0.0. (âHP Polandâ) is an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of HP Co. headquartered in Warsaw, Poland. HP Polandâs books, records and
accounts are consolidated into HP Co.âs books and records and reported by HP Co. in its
financial statements.

6. Hewlett-Packard MÃ©xico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (âHP Mexicoâ) is an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of HP Co. headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico. HP Mexicoâs
books, records and accounts are consolidated into HPâs books and records and reported by HP in
its financial statements.

Background

7. HP is a global provider of personal computers, printers, software and related
information technology infrastructure and services. HP operates through wholly-owned or
indirect subsidiaries. During the relevant period, HP sold its products and services through its
subsidiaries and through distributors and re-sellers worldwide. The financial statements of each
of HPâs subsidiaries are consolidated into HP Co.âs financial statements.

8. HPâs global operations are organized by geographic regions and sub-regions, as
well as business units. Employees in HPâs foreign subsidiaries may report to a supervisor in
both their geographic region and their business unit. During the relevant period, HPâs foreign
subsidiaries operated pursuant to compliance policies and directives developed by HP and
implemented at the local subsidiary level by the country or regional management. Although HP
had certain anti-corruption policies and controls in place during the relevant period, those
policies and controls were not adequate to prevent the conduct described herein and were
insufficiently implemented on the regional or country level. Further, HP failed to devise and
maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that: (1) access to assets was permitted only in accordance with managementâs
authorization; (2) transactions were recorded as necessary to maintain accountability for assets;
and (3) transactions were executed in accordance with managementâs authorization.

Unlawful Payments in Russia

9. Between approximately 2000 and 2007, HP Russia promised to pay and did pay
bribes through a series of agents and consultants to foreign government officials in Russia in
order to win a government tender for computer hardware and software worth more than â¬35

3
million. The contract was expected to be the first phase of a larger project that contemplated
subsequent tenders with a total estimated value in excess of $100 million.

10. In or about December 2000, the Russian government announced a project to
automate the telecommunications and computing infrastructure of the Office of the Prosecutor
General of Russia (the âGPO Projectâ). The GPO Project represented an opportunity for HP
Russia to become a more significant player in the Russian government sector. In addition to the
GPO Projectâs potential $100 million price tag, which would have been the largest transaction
ever for HP in the region, HP Russia executives believed that the project was the âgolden keyâ
that could lead to substantial additional business with other Russian state entities.

11. The GPO utilized a state-owned entity organized within the Executive Branch of
the Russian Government (âRussian SOE 1ââ) to manage the GPO Project tender and execution.

12. In order to win the GPO Project tender, HP Russia executives agreed to partner
with a series of third party intermediaries who had close ties to Russian officials overseeing the
tender. In December 2000, the principal of a small U.S. company with ties to the Russian
government officials (the âU.S. Agentâ) approached HP Russia executives and warned that the
deal was in jeopardy but that he could assist HP Russia in winning the tender. HP Russia agreed
to pay this agent as much as $1.2 million if the deal went forward. HP Russia also promised to
use the U.S. Agent as the principal subcontractor on the deal responsible for, among other things,
hiring the subcontractors to supply the hardware, software and installations services to the GPO.

13. In January 2001, HP Russia was awarded the GPO Project tender by Russian SOE
1. In June 2001, HP Russiaâs Country Manager for the relevant business unit signed the GPO
contract on behalf of HP pursuant to a power-of-attorney. In late 2002, the Russian Government
switched the method of financing utilized for the GPO Project.

14. Because the Russian government initially sought to finance the project through a
guarantee from a U.S. government-backed export bank, the deal had to meet certain U.S. content
requirements. As a result, HP Co., the parent company in the U.S., agreed to serve as the
contracting party on the deal.

15. HPâs International Business Center (âIBCââ) in the U.S. typically handled the
coordination and logistics for contracts that required exporting products from the U.S. to foreign
countries. IBCâs role was, among other things, to ensure that the products were properly
manufactured and shipped overseas, conduct due diligence on any subcontractors engaged on the
project, and ensure that HP complied with U.S. content requirements. HP Russia, however,
requested that the U.S. agent act as principal subcontractor on the deal.

16. During 2001 and 2002, IBC employees raised questions about the U.S. Agentâs
size and capabilities to handle such a large, complex project, including its role on the project, the

4
services it was to perform, and the payments that HP Russia intended to make to it under the
GPO contract. They told the HP Russia employees that they would not approve the transaction
until these questions were answered. When the IBC employees conducted due diligence on the
U.S. Agent, they learned from public records that the agent appeared to be in the medical supply
business and had an annual income of only a few hundred thousand dollars. Before the HP
Russia employees answered IBCâs questions, U.S. financing fell through and the deal moved to
Europe.

17. After the GPO encountered problems securing financing with the U.S. bank, in
2003 a German bank agreed to guarantee financing on the GPO transaction. The general terms
of the deal remained the same, except that the contract was now valued in euro and required
German, not U.S., content. HP Russia also replaced the U.S. agent with a German company to
satisfy German content requirements. A new Russian government agency (âRussian SOE 2â)
also took over responsibility for managing the GPO tender, replacing Russian SOE 1. Oversight
of the project moved to an HP subsidiary in Germany, Hewlett-Packard ISE GmbH (âHP ISEâ),
and employees at the parent company had no further role.

18. Following the change in financing and management, Russian officials considered
issuing a new tender and re-opening the bidding. Afraid that they might lose the deal, in April
2003, certain HP Russia executives and representatives promised to make improper payments of
approximately â¬2.8 million to a government official at Russian SOE 2 who was responsible for
managing the project on behalf of the GPO. HP Russia executives agreed to make the payments
through a German agent who would act as the pass-through for the bribes. The German agent
was purportedly responsible for, among other things, hiring other subcontractors to supply the
hardware, software and installation services to the GPO. The promise to make the improper
payments to the Russian government official through the German agent was approved by HP
Russiaâs country manager for the relevant business group. Approximately â¬8 million was passed
through the German agent to various shell companies, at least one of which was associated with
a senior official of Russian SOE 2.

19. Due to the German content requirements, when the contract was reissued, HP ISE
replaced HP Co. as the contracting entity on the deal and HP Russia employees continued to
manage the project.

20. On August 1, 2003, HP Russiaâs country manager for the relevant business unit
signed the contract on behalf of HP ISE with no authorization and no power of attorney. The
country manager also bypassed an internal HP approval process for large projects which was
supposed to provide HP with visibility into pricing, discounts, and profit margins for
transactions. When HP ISEâs management learned three months later that the country manager
had already signed the contract without the appropriate review or authorization, they ratified the
contract through a retroactive power of attorney.

5
21. In order to hide the improper payments, the HP Russia employees maintained two
sets of project pricing records: (1) an internal set of documents that identified the recipients of the
improper payments, and (i1) a sanitized version of the same documents that were provided to
management in the credit, finance, and legal offices outside of HP Russia. One example of this
was a password-protected spreadsheet maintained by the HP Russia employees. The HP Russia
internal version of the spreadsheet included a column labeled âOther Costsâ which broke out the
â¬8 million being passed through the German agent, including â¬2.8 million to be paid to a shell
company associated with an employee of Russian SOE 2, and another â¬2 million labeled
âGosorgonyâ (the Russian term for state agencies). The spreadsheet circulated to management
and other employees had no references to either the shell company or âGosorgony.â A second
document used to track the payments was a financial spreadsheet template designed to identify
transaction revenues and costs for HP. The internal HP Russia version of the financial
spreadsheet included a page titled âPassthrough Activity,â which reflected the same breakout of
the â¬8 million being passed through the agent and indicated that the payments would be hidden
by including them in the hardware costs of the contract. The version of the financial spreadsheet
provided to management outside Russia omitted all references to the âPassthrough Activityâ and
instead reflected only the inflated hardware prices.

22. HP Russiaâs credit officer assigned to conduct the approval review for the GPO
deal initially denied credit approval for the German agent in October 2003. HP Russiaâs credit
officer questioned the purpose of the â¬8 million markup being paid to the German agent. She
also questioned the role of the subcontractors on the deal. A member of the HP Russia deal team
falsely responded that the entire â¬8 million was for services that the German agent or its

99 66

subcontractors would perform, including âorganization of work in Germany,â âprocessing,â
âconsolidation of equipment,â âdispatch of goods to Russiaâ and âperformance of work to install
the equipment.â The credit officer asked the HP Russia deal team to provide, among other
things, âexact names of all [subcontractors],â their âroles in the project,â and âpayment terms.â
In response, a member of the HP Russia deal team provided a list of purported subcontractors,
including the German agent. However, the list did not identify the payment entities that were
included on the internal documents maintained by HP Russia sales employees. Despite the
questions raised about the subcontractors and the â¬8 million markup being paid to the German

agent, the deal went forward without any meaningful due diligence on the German agent.

23. Over the course of the GPO Project, more than â¬21 million flowed through the
German agent. The German agent kept less than â¬200,000 of that amount, passing the rest on to
other parties. Although some of the funds went to pay for goods and services actually provided
under the contract, a portion of the â¬8 million paid to the German agent went to shell companies
that performed no services. Over the course of the GPO Project, the German agent funneled
more than â¬311,000 to bank accounts associated with the Russian government official. Another
â¬2.2 million was wired to the Latvian and Lithuanian accounts of other shell companies and used
to purchase expensive jewelry, luxury automobiles, travel, and other items.

24. The payments to the agent were falsely recorded in HP Russiaâs books and
records as hardware costs or payments to subcontractors for legitimate services under the GPO
Project. HP earned approximately $10.4 million in illicit profits on the GPO Project.

Unlawful Payments in Poland

25. From approximately 2006 through at least 2010, HP Poland, acting through
certain of its agents or employees, made improper payments to one or more public officials in
order to secure and maintain lucrative government contracts. These contracts were with the
Komenda GlÃ©wna Policji (âKGPââ), the Polish national police agency.

26. Prior to 2006, the KGP had awarded a number of public tenders to HP Poland and
its local partners. In or around 2006, a new KGP official â the Director of Information and
Communications Technology (the âPolish IT Officialâ) â assumed responsibility for reviewing
previously-awarded technology contracts and awarding future contracts.

27. In or around October 2006, HP Poland invited the Polish IT Official to a
technology industry conference in San Francisco, California. Certain HP Poland employees,
including HP Polandâs District Manager of Public Sector Sales and Public Sector Sales Lead (the
âHP Poland Executiveââ), attended as well. Over the course of the trip, the HP Poland employees
circumvented HPâs internal controls in several respects to develop an improper relationship with
the Polish IT Official.

28. The weekend before the conference, HP Poland employees paid for dinners, gifts
and sightseeing by the Polish IT Official in San Francisco. On the third day of the conference,
they took the Polish IT Official on a sightseeing trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, with no legitimate
business purpose. The HP Poland employees paid for various of the Polish IT Officialâs
expenses, including drinks, dining, and a private tour flight over the Grand Canyon. In
circumvention of HPâs internal controls, the HP Poland employees paid for many of these
expenses in cash, without authorization, and failed to document them in HPâs books and records
accurately.

29. Upon returning to Poland, the HP Poland Executive and the Polish IT official met
frequently to discuss HP Polandâs existing and future business opportunities with the KGP.
Beginning in late 2006, one or more HP Poland employees began giving technology products to
the Polish IT official for personal use. Early gifts included HP products, such as desktop and
laptop computers, and over time expanded to include, among other things, additional HP
computers and devices, iPods, flat screen televisions, cameras, and a home theater system.
These gifts violated HP internal controls relating to gift-giving, and expenses associated with
these gifts were not accurately recorded in HP Polandâs books and records.

30. In or about January 2007, shortly after receiving the first gifts, the Polish IT
Official signed a contract on behalf of the Polish government with HP Poland valued at
approximately $4.3 million. The next month, the Polish IT Official signed another contract with
HP Poland valued at approximately $5.8 million. The KGP awarded both contracts, which were
for technology services and HP products, using âsingle sourceâ bidding procedures.

31. Around the date of the second contract award, one or more HP Poland employees
and agents expanded the bribes to include large cash payments from off-the-books accounts and
agreed to pay the Polish IT Official 1.2% of HP Polandâs net revenue on any contract awarded
by the KGP.

32. In or about March 2007, the Polish IT Official signed a KGP contract with HP
Poland valued at approximately $15.8 million. Around this date, the HP Poland Executive left a
bag containing $150,000 in cash at the Polish IT Officialâs home. On another occasion in 2007,
the HP Poland Executive gave the Polish IT Official $100,000 in cash in a Warsaw parking lot.

33. In 2008, the HP Poland Executive gave the Polish IT Official bags of cash on at
least four occasions totaling approximately $360,000. That year the Polish IT Official signed
three contracts on behalf of the Polish government with HP Poland. These agreements, executed
in or about January, April and May 2008, were valued at approximately $32 million in total.

34. One or more HP Poland employees facilitated the corrupt relationship with the
Polish IT Official through covert means. In one method, the HP Poland Executive established
multiple anonymous e-mail accounts and shared the passwords with the Polish IT Official so that
he could write and save messages as âdraftsâ within the account. The HP Poland Executive also
provided the Polish IT Official with pre-paid mobile telephones. The HP Poland Executive and
the Poland IT Official also met in remote locations where they would communicate silently by
typing on a laptop computer. These messages addressed, among other topics, information about
upcoming tenders and bribe amounts.

35. In mid-2008, the Polish IT Official was promoted to a new position within the
Polish Interior Ministry, where he was responsible for information technology projects. In mid-
2009, the HP Poland Executive paid the Polish IT Official approximately $6,000 in cash.

36. Sometime thereafter, the HP Poland Executive offered to pay the Polish IT
Official to help secure a new contract with the KGP. The contract was ultimately awarded to HP
Poland in or about April 2010, and was valued at approximately $4 million. The contract was
signed by two of the Polish IT Officialâs former subordinates. Despite the prior agreement, no
employee or agent of HP Poland ultimately paid the Polish IT Official any money related to this
award.

37. In total, between approximately 2006 and 2010, HP Poland employees and agents
provided the Polish IT Official at least $600,000 in cash, gifts worth more than $30,000, and
several thousand dollars in travel and entertainment benefits. During this same period, the Polish
government directly awarded HP Poland at least seven contracts for KPG-related information-
technology products and services, with an overall value of approximately $60 million.

38. HPâs internal controls were inadequate to, and did not, detect or prevent improper
payments to the Polish IT Official over the course of almost four years. HP Polandâs books and
records also falsely recorded the payments in its books and records during this period. HP
earned approximately $16.1 million in illicit profits on the KGP contracts.

Unlawful Payments in Mexico

39, In 2009, HP Mexico paid a commission to an entity with ties to Mexican public
officials in connection with HPâs bid to obtain lucrative government contracts.

AO. Beginning in mid-2008, the HP Mexico sales team began pre-sales activities and
discussions with Petroleos Mexicanos, Mexicoâs state-owned petroleum company better known
as Pemex, for the sale of a suite of business technology optimization software, hardware,
services and licenses. The software and licensing contracts (collectively, the âBTO Dealâ) were
worth approximately $6 million.

41. HP Mexico sales managers on the BTO Deal knew that they could not win the
business without working with, and making payments to, a Mexican information-technology and
consulting company that was closely affiliated with senior Pemex officials (the âMexican
Consultantâ). As the HP Mexico sales managers knew, Pemexâs Chief Operating Officer was a
former principal of the Mexican Consultant. HP Mexicoâs sales managers also knew that the
Pemex Chief Operating Officer supervised the Pemex Chief Information Officer, who was a key
signatory on behalf of Pemex for the BTO Deal.

42. Although the Mexican Consultant had prior technical experience with Pemexâs IT
systems, HP Mexico ultimately selected the Mexican Consultant as a channel partner on the
BTO Deal primarily because of the Mexican Consultantâs connections to Pemex officials. As
part of its agreement with the Mexican Consultant, HP Mexico agreed to pay the Mexican
Consultant a âcommission,â which HP Mexico also called an âinfluencer fee,â equal to 25% of
the licensing and support components of the BTO Deal.

43. HP Mexico understood from early in the negotiation with Pemex that it had to
retain the Mexican Consultant in order to win the Pemex contracts. In one instance, an agent of
the Mexican Consultant threatened to take the BTO Deal to one of HP Mexicoâs competitors if

9
the Mexican Consultant was not paid its full requested commission. That same agent was a
former HP Mexico manager who, several months before, had supervised HP Mexicoâs sales
managers on the BTO Deal team.

44. HP policy governing the payment of commissions to third parties required that the
recipients of such payments enter into a written channel partner contract with an addendum
permitting the payment of commissions, be pre-approved, subjected to due diligence, and
registered in HPâs partner system. HP policy also required that channel partner commissions be
approved through an approval matrix, with commissions exceeding a particular percentage of the
transactionâs value requiring additional approvals.

45. The Mexican Consultant was not a pre-approved channel partner of HP Mexico
and had not entered into a written channel partner agreement as required by HPâs internal
controls and policies. Faced with HPâs channel partner policy, but needing to pay the Mexican
Consultant to win the Pemex business, HP Mexico sales managers arranged for another entity
(the âPass-Throughââ), which had been previously approved as an HP Mexico channel partner, to
step into the transaction. Although the Pass-Through played no role in negotiating or assisting
with the BTO Deal, HP Mexico recorded it as the deal partner in its internal tracking system. HP
Mexicoâs sales managers arranged for the Pass-Through to receive the commission from HP
Mexico and pass it on to the Mexican Consultant, keeping a percentage as a fee for its own role.

A6. Although the introduction of the Pass-Through allowed HP Mexico to pay the
Mexican Consultant, it created another problem. Because HP Mexico had committed to paying
the Mexican Consultant a commission equal to 25% of the BTO Deal, the maximum permissible
without seeking additional approvals under the applicable approval matrix, there was no margin
available to compensate the Pass-Through for its role in the deal. As a result, HP Mexico sales
managers sought permission from HP regional officials to increase the authorized deal
commission by 1.5% to 26.5%. In support of their request, an HP Mexico sales manager sent an
email claiming that the Mexican Consultant deserved an increased commission primarily
because it had put in extra work and successfully managed discounts with Pemex. The
justification omitted any reference to the role of, or payments to, the Pass-Through. The 1.5%
increase in the commission was approved by the regional officials on that same day with little or
no additional review.

47. On or about December 22, 2008, HP Mexico signed the contracts with Pemex for
the BTO Deal. In February 2009, HP Mexico wired approximately $1.66 million to the Pass-
Through pursuant to invoices referencing the Pemex BTO contract. The Pass-Through then
transferred approximately $1.41 million to the Mexican Consultant. The Pass-Through kept the
difference as a fee.

10
A8. At least some of this money went to benefit a government official. In March
2009, the Mexican Consultant made cash payments totaling approximately $125,000 to an entity
controlled by Pemexâs Chief Information Officer, the public official who had signed the BTO
contract.

49. Simply by injecting the Pass-Through in the transaction, HP Mexico sales
managers were able to evade HPâs policies requiring pre-approval of channel partners and
written agreements for third-party payments. In addition, HP Co.âs books and records falsely
reflected that the Pass-Through was the deal partner, when in fact the true deal partner was the
Mexican Consultant. Moreover, HP Mexico sales managers were able to obtain authorization
from HP regional management to pay an additional 1.5% commission payment to the Mexican
Consultant without describing the true reason for the increase, which was to pay the Pass-
Through for its role in the transaction, further highlighting the lax internal control environment
within HP Co. Finally, these various payments to the Mexican Consultant were falsely recorded
in HP Mexicoâs books and records as legitimate commission payments.

50. HP earned approximately $2.5 million in illicit profits on the BTO Deal.

Additional Conduct

51. In June and July 2006, several European HP subsidiaries, including HP Russia,
arranged for a high-profile customer marketing event in connection with the FIFA World Cup
soccer tournament in Germany. Despite managerial directives not to invite representatives of
government customers, certain HP sales employees arranged for a number of government or
state-owned customers to attend the event. In all, HP Russia and other European subsidiaries of
HP paid tens of thousands of dollars in travel and entertainment expenses for these government
customers, and HP Co.âs internal controls failed to detect or prevent the conduct.

52. Finally, in June 2005, HP Russia paid more than $2.5 million to a third party
distributor for the supply of software and implementation services to a Russian state-owned
enterprise. HP Russiaâs records do not reflect what, if any, work was actually performed by the
distributor for these payments, and communications among HP Russia employees suggest that
the distributor may have played an influential role in connection with obtaining the contract. The
payments to the distributor were recorded in HP Russiaâs books and records as a payment for
providing software and services, even though there was minimal evidence concerning what was
actually provided for these payments.

Legal Standards and Violations

A. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was,

11
or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act of omission the person knew or should have
known would contribute to such violation.

FCPA Violations

B. Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].

C. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization;
(11) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

D. As described above, HP Co. violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Acct. Its
subsidiaries in Russia, Poland and Mexico falsely recorded the payments made to agents as
payments for legitimate services or commissions, when the true purpose of these payments was to
make corrupt payments to government officials to obtain business. The false entries were then
consolidated and reported by HP in its consolidated financial statements. HP Co. also violated
Section 13(b)(2)(B) by failing to devise and maintain sufficient accounting controls to detect and
prevent the making of improper payments to foreign officials and ensure that payments were made
only to approved channel partners.

HPâs Remedial Efforts

E. In response to the Commissionâs investigation, HP retained outside counsel to
assist it in conducting an internal investigation into improper conduct in the jurisdictions that
were the subject of the staffâs inquiry, as well as in other jurisdictions where HP identified
additional issues. HP cooperated with the Commissionâs investigation by voluntarily producing
reports and other materials to the Commission staff summarizing the findings of its internal
investigation. HP also cooperated by, among other things, voluntarily producing translations of
numerous documents, providing timely reports on witness interviews, and by making foreign
employees available to the Commission staff to interview.

F, HP has also undertaken significant remedial actions over the course of the
Commissionâs investigation, including by implementing a firm-wide screening process for its
channel partners, training its public sector sales staff on its policies for dealing with business

12
intermediaries, increasing compliance-related training for its global work force, and
implementing additional enhancements to its internal controls and compliance functions. In
addition, HP took disciplinary actions against certain of its employees in response to the conduct
identified by the Commission staff and by the company through its internal investigation.

Criminal Disposition

G. HPâs indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries have entered into dispositions with the
United States Department of Justice to resolve potential criminal liability for conduct relating to
certain of the findings in the Order, namely a Plea Agreement by HP Russia, a Deferred
Prosecution Agreement involving HP Poland, and a Non-Prosecution Agreement involving HP
Mexico.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent HP Co.âs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent HP Co. cease and desist

$29,000,000 and prejudgment interest of $5,000,000 to the United States Treasury. $2,527,750 of
Respondentâs disgorgement obligation will be satisfied by Respondentâs payment of $2,527,750 in
forfeiture as part of HP Mexicoâs resolution with the United States Department of Justice. If
timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.
Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Hewlett-Packard Company as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Tracy L. Davis,
Assistant Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 44
Montgomery Street, Suite 2800, San Francisco, CA 94104.

C. Respondent shall report to the Commission staff periodically, at no less than twelve-
month intervals during a three-year term, the status of its remediation and implementation of
compliance measures. Should Respondent discover credible evidence, not already reported to the
Commission staff, that questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt transfers of
property or interests may have been offered, promised, paid, or authorized by Respondent entity or
person, or any entity or person while working directly for Respondent, or that related false books
and records have been maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to the
Commission staff. During this three-year period, Respondent shall: (1) conduct an initial review
and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two (2) follow-up reviews and
reports, as described below:

1) Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a written report within one (1) year of
the entry of this Order setting forth a complete description of its Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (âFCPAââ) and anti-corruption related remediation efforts to date, its
proposals reasonably designed to improve the policies and procedures of Respondent
for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and

comments provided by the Commission staff on the previous report, to further monitor
and assess whether the policies and procedures of Respondent are reasonably designed
to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws
(the âFollow-up Reportsâ).

3) The first Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later than one (1) year after the
Initial Report. The second Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later than one

14
4)

5)

(1) year after the completion of the first Follow-up Report. Respondent may extend the
time period for issuance of the Follow-up Reports with prior written approval of the
Commission staff.

Respondentâs reporting obligations pursuant to the Order, and its concurrent reporting
obligations pursuant to the resolutions of certain of its subsidiaries with the U.S.
Department of Justice, shall each be satisfied by the simultaneous submission of the
same reports to both the Commission staff and the Department of Justice.

The periodic reviews and reports submitted by Respondent will likely include
proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive business information. Public
disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation, impede pending or potential
government investigations or undermine the objectives of the reporting requirement.
For these reasons, among others, the reports and the contents thereof are intended to
remain and shall remain non-public, except (1) pursuant to court order, (2) as agreed by
the parties in writing, (3) to the extent that the Commission staff determines in its sole
discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commissionâs discharge of its
duties and responsibilities, or (4) is otherwise required by law.

SEC Charges Hewlett-Packard With FCPA Violations

Company to Pay $108 Million to Settle Civil and Criminal Cases

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-73

Washington D.C., April 9, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Hewlett-Packard with violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries in three different countries made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain
lucrative public contracts.

Hewlett-Packard has agreed to pay more than $108 million to settle the SECâs charges and a parallel criminal case announced today by the
U.S. Department of Justice.

The SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings finds that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based technology companyâs subsidiary in Russia
paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multi-million dollar
contract with the federal prosecutorâs office. In Poland, Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than
$600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency. And as part of its bid to win a software sale to
Mexicoâs state-owned petroleum company, Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a
consultant with close ties to company officials, and money was funneled to one of those officials.

âHewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The
companyâs books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses,â said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC
Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âCompanies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably
designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting
business on their behalf.â

According to the SECâs order, the scheme involving Hewlett-Packardâs Russian subsidiary occurred from approximately 2000 to 2007. The
bribes were paid through agents and consultants in order to win a government contract for computer hardware and software. Employees
within the subsidiary and elsewhere raised questions about the significant markup being paid to the agent on the deal and the subcontractors
that the agent expected to use. Despite the red flags, the deal went forward without any meaningful due diligence on the agent or the
subcontractors.

The SECâs order finds that bribes involving Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary in Poland occurred from approximately 2006 to 2010. Acting
primarily through its public sector sales manager, the subsidiary agreed to pay a Polish government official in order to win contracts for
information technology products and services. The official received a percentage of net revenue earned from the contracts, and the bribes
were delivered in cash from off-the-books accounts.

According to the SECâs order, Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary in Mexico paid a consultant to help the company win a public IT contract worth
approximately $6 million. At least $125,000 was funneled to a government official at the state-owned petroleum company with whom the
consultant had connections. Although the consultant was not an approved deal partner and had not been subjected to the due diligence
required under company policy, HP Mexico sales managers used a pass-through entity to pay inflated commissions to the consultant. This
was internally referred to as the âinfluencer fee.â

Hewlett-Packard consented to the SECâs order, which finds that it violated the internal controls and books and records provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company agreed to pay $29 million in disgorgement (approximately $26.47 million to the SEC and
$2.53 million to satisfy an IRS forfeiture as part of the criminal matter). Hewlett-Packard also agreed to pay prejudgment interest of $5
million to the SEC and fines totaling $74.2 million in the criminal case for a total of more than $108 million in disgorgement and penalties.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by David A. Berman and Tracy L. Davis of the FCPA Unit in San Francisco. The SEC appreciates the
assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California as well as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and Public Prosecutorâs Office in Dresden, Germany.

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ), against Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation
(âSmith & Wessonâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferââ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these

Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderââ), as set forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds thatâ:

Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ââFCPAâââ) by Smith & Wesson. The
violations took place from 2007 through early 2010, when a senior employee and other employees
and representatives of Smith & Wesson made, authorized, and offered to make improper payments
and/or to provide gifts to foreign officials in an attempt to win contracts to sell firearm products to
foreign military and law enforcement departments. During this period, Smith & Wessonâs
international business was in its developing stages and accounted for approximately 10% of the
companyâs revenues. Smith & Wessonâs employees and representatives engaged in a systemic
pattern of making, authorizing and offering bribes while seeking to expand the companyâs overseas
business.

2. The bribe payments were inaccurately recorded in Smith & Wessonâs books and
records as legitimate sales commissions or other business expenses. Despite its push to make sales
in new and high risk markets overseas, Smith & Wesson failed to establish an appropriate
compliance program or devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls,
which allowed the repeated improper offers and payments to continue undetected for years.

Respondent

3. Smith & Wesson is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in
Springfield, Massachusetts. The company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Smith & Wesson
Corp., manufactures firearms and markets its products both domestically in the United States and
internationally in multiple countries. Smith & Wesson does not have any international subsidiaries
and conducts its international business directly and through brokering agents. Much of Smith &
Wessonâs international business involves the sale of firearms to foreign law enforcement and
military departments. Smith & Wesson issues and maintains a class of publicly-traded securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, which trades on the NASDAQ Stock
Exchange.

Facts

4. From 2007 through early 2010, as Smith & Wesson sought to break into
international markets and increase sales, certain of the companyâs employees and representatives
engaged in a pervasive practice of making, authorizing and offering improper payments to foreign
government officials as a means of obtaining or retaining international business. Although only

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to the Respondentâs Offer and are not binding on any other person or entity
in this or any other proceeding.
one of the contracts was fulfilled before the unlawful activity was identified, company employees
made or authorized the making of improper payments in connection with multiple ongoing or
contemplated international sales.

5. In 2008, for example, Smith & Wesson retained a third-party agent in Pakistan to
assist the company in obtaining a deal to sell firearms to a Pakistani police department. Even after
the agent notified the company that he would be providing guns valued in excess of $11,000 to
Pakistani police officials in order to obtain the deal, and that he would be making additional cash
payments to the officials, the company authorized the agent to proceed with the deal. Smith &
Wessonâs Vice President of International Sales and its Regional Director of International Sales
authorized the sale of the guns to the agent to be used as improper gifts and authorized payment of
the commissions to the agent, while knowing or consciously disregarding the fact that the agent
would be providing the guns and part of his commissions to Pakistani officials as an inducement
for them to award the tender to the company. Smith & Wesson ultimately sold 548 pistols to the
Pakistani police for $210,980 and profited from the corrupt deal in the amount of $107,852.

6. In 2009, Smith & Wesson attempted to win a contract to sell firearms to an
Indonesian police department by making improper payments to its third party agent in Indonesia,
who indicated that part of the payment would be provided to the Indonesian police officials under
the guise of legitimate firearm lab testing costs. On several occasions, Smith & Wessonâs third-
party agent indicated that the Indonesian police expected Smith & Wesson to pay them additional
amounts above the actual cost of testing the guns as an inducement to enter the contract. The agent
later notified Smith & Wessonâs Regional Director of International Sales that the price of âtestingâ
the guns had risen further. Smith & Wessonâs Vice President of International Sales and its
Regional Director of International Sales authorized and made the inflated payment, but a deal was
never consummated.

7. Similarly, Smith & Wesson made improper payments in 2009 to its third party
agent in Turkey, who indicated that part of the payments would be provided to Turkish officials in
an attempt to secure two deals in Turkey, for the sale of handcuffs to Turkish police and firearms
to the Turkish military. Neither of these interactions resulted in the shipment of products, as Smith
& Wesson was unsuccessful bidding for the first deal, while the latter deal was ultimately
canceled. Similarly, Smith & Wesson authorized improper payments to third party agents who
indicated that parts of these payments would be provided to foreign officials in Nepal and
Bangladesh in unsuccessful attempts to secure sales contracts in those countries. Although these
contemplated deals in Nepal and Bangladesh were never consummated in each case, the company
had obtained or attempted to obtain the contract by using third party agents as a conduit for
improper payments to government officials.

8. Despite making it a high priority to grow sales in new and high risk markets
overseas, the company failed to design and implement a system of internal controls or an
appropriate FCPA compliance program reasonably designed to address the increased risks of its
new business model. The company did not perform any anti-corruption risk assessment and
conducted virtually no due diligence of its third-party agents regardless of the perceived level of
corruption in the country in which Smith & Wesson was seeking to do business. Smith & Wesson

3
failed to devise adequate policies and procedures for commission payments, the use of samples for
test and evaluation, gifts, and commission advances. The Vice President of International Sales had
almost complete authority to conduct the companyâs international business, including the sole
ability to approve most commissions. Smith & Wessonâs FCPA policies and procedures, and its
FCPA-related training and supervision also were inadequate. As a result of these compliance and
internal controls failures, Smith & Wessonâs Vice President of International Sales and the Regional
Director of International Sales were able to cause the company to pay and/or authorize improper
payments in numerous countries around the globe for a period of several years.

Smith & Wessonâs Remedial Measures

9. Smith & Wesson took prompt action to remediate its immediate FCPA issues,
including: conducting an internal investigation, terminating its entire international sales staff;
terminating pending international sales transactions; and re-evaluating the markets in which it
sought international sales. In addition, Smith & Wesson implemented a series of significant
measures to improve its internal controls and compliance processes, including: implementing new
internal audit procedures to identify FCPA issues; creating more robust controls on payments,
gifts, and other transactions in connection with international business activity; enhancing its FCPA
compliance policies and procedures; and creating a Business Ethics and Compliance Committee.

Legal Standards and Violations
10. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was, or would

be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such violation.

FCPA Violations

Anti-Bribery Violations

 

11. Smith & Wesson violated the anti-bribery provisions of the federal securities laws
when it authorized its agents to provide gift guns and make other improper payments to foreign
officials in Pakistan, Indonesia, Turkey, Nepal and Bangladesh in order to induce foreign
officials in those countries to award sales contracts to Smith & Wesson.

12. As aresult of the conduct described above, Smith & Wesson violated Section 30A
of the Exchange Act, which prohibits any issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act, in order to obtain or retain business, from giving, or authorizing
the giving of, anything of value to any foreign official for purposes of influencing the official or
inducing the official to act in violation of his or her lawful duties, or to secure any improper
advantage; or to induce a foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government or
foreign governmental instrumentality to influence any act or decision of such government or
instrumentality. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1.
Books and Records Violations

 

13. Smith & Wesson failed to properly account for the improper payments to its agent
in Pakistan, the inflated lab testing payments to its agent in Indonesia, and the improper expense
payments to its agents in Turkey in its books and records. Instead, Smith & Wesson improperly
characterized the payments it made in Pakistan as legitimate commissions, and those that it made
in Indonesia and Turkey as legitimate business expenses.

14. As aresult of the conduct described above, Smith & Wesson violated Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books,
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions
and disposition of their assets. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A).

Internal Controls Violations

 

15. Smith & Wesson failed to devise and maintain sufficient internal controls with
respect to its international sales operations. While the company had a basic corporate policy
prohibiting the payment of bribes, it failed to implement a reasonable system of controls to effectuate
that policy. For example, Smith & Wesson failed to devise adequate policies and procedures with
regard to commission payments, the use of samples for test and evaluation, gifts, and commission
advances. Further, Smith & Wessonâs FCPA policies and procedures, and its FCPA-related
training and supervision were inadequate.

16. As aresult of the conduct described above, Smith & Wesson violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to, among other things,
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific
authorization; transactions are recorded as necessary to maintain accountability for assets, and
that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managementâs general or specific
authorization. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B).

In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered the remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Respondent and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.

SEC Charges Smith & Wesson With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-148

Washington D.C., July 28, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation with
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when employees and representatives of the U.S.-based parent company authorized and
made improper payments to foreign officials while trying to win contracts to supply firearm products to military and law enforcement
overseas.

Smith & Wesson, which profited by more than $100,000 from the one contract that was completed before the unlawful activity was identified,
has agreed to pay $2 million to settle the SECâs charges. The company must report to the SEC on its FCPA compliance efforts for a period of
two years.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, the Springfield, Mass.-based firearms manufacturer sought to
break into new markets overseas starting in 2007 and continuing into early 2010. During that period, Smith & Wessonâs international sales
staff engaged in a pervasive effort to attract new business by offering, authorizing, or making illegal payments or providing gifts meant for
government officials in Pakistan, Indonesia, and other foreign countries.

âThis is a wake-up call for small and medium-size businesses that want to enter into high-risk markets and expand their international sales,â
said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âWhen a company makes the strategic decision to sell its products
overseas, it must ensure that the right internal controls are in place and operating.â

According to the SECâs order, Smith & Wesson retained a third-party agent in Pakistan in 2008 to help the company obtain a deal to sell
firearms to a Pakistani police department. Smith & Wesson officials authorized the agent to provide more than $11,000 worth of guns to
Pakistani police officials as gifts, and then make additional cash payments. Smith & Wesson ultimately won a contract to sell 548 pistols to
the Pakistani police for a profit of $107,852.

The SECâs order finds that Smith & Wesson employees made or authorized improper payments related to multiple other pending or
contemplated international sales contracts. For example, in 2009, Smith & Wesson attempted to win a contract to sell firearms to an
Indonesian police department by making improper payments to its third-party agent in Indonesia. The agent indicated he would provide a
portion of that money to Indonesian officials under the guise of legitimate firearm lab testing costs. He said Indonesian police officials
expected to be paid additional amounts above the actual cost of testing the guns. Smith & Wesson officials authorized and made the inflated
payment, but a deal was never consummated.

The SECâs order finds that Smith & Wesson also authorized improper payments to third-party agents who indicated that portions would be
provided to foreign officials in Turkey, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The attempts to secure sales contracts in those countries were ultimately
unsuccessful.

The SECâs order finds that Smith & Wesson violated the anti-bribery, internal controls and books and records provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The company agreed to pay $107,852 in disgorgement, $21,040 in prejudgment interest, and a $1.906 million
penalty. Smith & Wesson consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings. The SEC considered Smith & Wessonâs
cooperation with the investigation as well as the remedial acts taken after the conduct came to light. Smith & Wesson halted the impending
international sales transactions before they went through, and implemented a series of significant measures to improve its internal controls
and compliance process. The company also terminated its entire international sales staff.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by FCPA Unit members Mayeti Gametchu and Paul G. Block, who work in the Boston Regional Office.
The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-

In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
LAYNE CHRISTENSEN EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
COMPANY, FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-

AND-DESIST ORDER
Respondent.

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Layne Christensen Company (âLayne
Christensenâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
IIl.
On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds' that:
SUMMARY

1. These proceedings arise out of violations of the anti-bribery, recordkeeping,
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the âFCPAââ) by Layne
Christensen. Between 2005 and 2010, Layne Christensen, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in
Africa and Australia, made a total of more than $1,000,000 in improper payments to foreign
government officials in the Republic of Mali, the Republic of Guinea, Burkina Faso, the United
Republic of Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With the knowledge and
approval of one of its officers, Layne Christensen made these improper payments in order to obtain
favorable tax treatment, customs clearance for drilling equipment, work permits for expatriates, and
relief from inspection by immigration and labor officials, as well as, to avoid penalties for the
delinquent payment of taxes and customs duties and the failure to register immigrant workers.
Layne Christensen funded some of these payments through cash transfers from its U.S. bank
accounts to its Australian and African subsidiaries.

2. Layne Christensen falsely recorded these improper payments as legitimate
expenses and failed to maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances over its operations.

3. As a result of making improper payments to foreign officials in Africa,
Layne Christensen (1) realized improper tax benefits; (2) secured customs clearance of a drilling ng
and other equipment; (3) avoided assessed customs duties and associated penalties; and (4) secured
work permits for its employees and avoided the possible deportation of its undocumented workers
and penalties for the failure to register these workers. Overall, Layne Christensen realized benefits
of approximately $3.9 million by making improper payments to foreign officials in Africa between
2005 and 2010.

RESPONDENT

4. Layne Christensen is a Delaware corporation headquartered in The
Woodlands, TX. Layne Christensen is a global water management, construction, and drilling
company with more than 100 offices in Africa, Australia, Europe, South America, and North
America. Layne Christensenâs common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and its securities are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select
market under the ticker symbol LAYN.

 

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Tanzania, and Burkina Faso (âLayne Drillingâ). Layne Australia provides management and
financial accounting services to Layne Christensenâs companies operating in these African
countries. Layne Christensen exercised direct operational control over these wholly-owned
subsidiaries and consolidated their results in its financial statements.

 

6. Layne Drilling (DRC) SPRL (âLayne Drilling DRCâ) is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Layne Christensen held through a Delaware corporation and operates in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

 

FACTS
Knowledge of Improper Payments

7. The Mineral Exploration Division (âMinExâ) is Layne Christensenâs
second-largest business division and is primarily responsible for the Companyâs mineral
exploration drilling operations worldwide. Between 2005 and 2010, the president of MinEx (the
âMinEx Presidentâ) was a corporate officer of Layne Christensen and reported directly to Layne
Christensenâs Chief Executive Officer. Based in Salt Lake City, UT, the MinEx President
supervised all of Layne Christensenâs mineral exploration drilling operations, including
operations in Australia and Africa.

8. The MinEx President had knowledge of and, in some instances, authorized
the direct and indirect payment of bribes to foreign officials in Africa to obtain or retain
business. Specifically, he was aware of payments made to third-party agents retained by Layne
Christensenâs African subsidiaries in order to obtain favorable tax treatment and to customs
officials to obtain clearance for equipment and reduced customs duties.

Payments to Achieve Favorable Tax Treatment

9. Between 2005 and 2009, Layne Christensen paid approximately $768,000
in bribes to foreign officials in Mali, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, through
its wholly-owned subsidiaries WADS and Layne Drilling, in order to reduce its tax liability and
to avoid associated penalties for delinquent payment. By making these improper payments,
Layne Christensen realized more than $3.2 million in improper tax savings.
REPUBLIC OF MALI

10. In connection with a 2005 tax audit, the WADS subsidiary made two
improper payments totaling $93,000 to Malian tax officials through its local agent. The purpose
of these payments was to reduce its liability for unpaid taxes and associated penalties.

11. The payments were made on September 5, 2005 and October 19, 2005.
WADS falsely recorded the payments, respectively, as an âAdvance of Auditâ in its prepaid
taxes account and as the âtake up costâ of the agentâs freight invoice (no freight services were
provided).

12. The MinEx President was aware that WADS had engaged the agent in
order to reduce its tax liability, and that as a result WADS had reduced its tax liability to less
than half the original assessment. The MinEx President did not question how these tax savings
were achieved.

13. In order to fund the payments, the chief financial officer of MinEx (the
âMinEx CFOâ) directed another Layne Christensen subsidiary to transfer funds to WADS and
WADSâs financial controller to execute a cash call to Layne Christensenâs corporate office.
Layne Christensen wired funds from one of its U.S. banks accounts to WADS on the same day.

14. In 2007, WADS again made two improper payments to Malian tax
officials through the same agent that it used in 2005. As a result of the payments, Layne avoided
taxes and penalties of more than $1.2 million.

15. The check requisition used to make a payment to the agent listed the
purpose of this payment as âFret fees for containerâ and it was accompanied by an invoice from
an unrelated company. The payment of $168,000 was falsely recorded as freight fees in Layneâs
books and records.

16. Following this payment, WADS received an official notice reflecting a
substantial reduction in its tax assessment and indicating that WADS was entitled to a credit of
approximately $280,000 that could be used to offset its tax liability. Internal emails show that
the Malian tax inspectors had requested a payment of about $67,000 to ensure that WADS would
receive this tax credit. WADSâs financial controller wrote, âWe have already paid the equivalent
of $US$168K to [tax agent]. I was under the impression that this took care of all of âtheirâ
payments.â Nevertheless, one day later, WADS issued another check to the tax agent in the
amount of approximately $68,000. The accompanying check requisition identified the payment
as related to âFiscal Audit 2005/2006â and WADS falsely recorded it as âProperty Rates and
Taxesâ in its books and records.

17. The MinEx CFO provided the MinEx President with a memo summarizing
the history of the tax assessments and the subsequent reductions. As in 2005, the MinEx
President did not question how the tax savings were achieved.
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA

18. In 2006, WADS reduced its tax liability by paying bribes through two
lawyers retained at the suggestion of the tax authorities but who provided no services.

19. WADS received an official tax assessment for the tax years 2002-2004 on
February 15, 2006. However, prior to this date, WADSâs Finance Manager and tax consultants
from a local affiliate of a large multinational accounting firm (âInternational Tax Consultantsâ)
had been negotiating the amount of the assessment with Guinean tax officials. The WADS
Finance Manager told the MinEx CFO that the official assessment was substantially lower than
the amount that the Guinean tax authority had initially proposed but acceptance of this lower
amount was conditioned on WADS making the payment within two days of the assessment.
Without providing any supporting documentation, the MinEx CFO sent an email to Layne
Christensenâs corporate office seeking an urgent transfer of funds. Despite the lack of
documentation or a justification for the transfer, Layne Christensen wired more than $200,000
from a U.S. bank account to WADSâs local bank account on the same day.

20. On February 17, 2006, WADS made a single payment of approximately
$97,648 to the tax authority and payments of $24,000 and $101,000 to the two lawyers,
respectively. In comparison, WADS paid the International Tax Consultants only $8,400 for their
Services.

21. WADS falsely recorded the payments made to the lawyers as legal
expense although internal communications show that the lawyers provided no services. In a
March 14, 2006 memorandum to the MinEx CFO, the MinEx Tax Manager acknowledged that
âThe [C]ompany has never engaged any lawyers or other accountants in Guinea and [is] never
likely to.â However, he reasoned that although the payments to the lawyers could not be
considered legal expense because although the lawyers did not perform any work and were
âmerely a conduit for the money,â WADS could record them as tax expense because WADS
would have faced a larger tax assessment if it had not made these payments.

22. In 2008, WADS obtained over a 90% reduction in its assessed taxes and
penalties by funneling an improper payment of $273,000 to Guinean tax officials through the
same lawyers that it used in connection with the 2006 audit.

23. On June 26 and 27, 2008, the lawyers submitted invoices to WADS
totaling approximately $273,000 purportedly for rendering assistance with the tax audit. Neither
lawyer participated in negotiating the setthement of the tax audit. WADS paid the lawyersâ
invoices on July 22, 2008.

24. Layne Christensen funded the payments to the lawyers through wire
transfers from a U.S. bank account. On July 2, 2008, the MinEx CFO sought a cash call from
Layne Christensenâs corporate office. The stated purpose of the request was to pay WADSâs
outstanding taxes but the amount requested exceeded the assessed tax amount. Without
supporting documentation or further justification, Layne Christensen wired the funds on July 2
and 21, 2008, and falsely recorded the payments as tax expense.

25. In an internal memorandum dated July 23, 2008 that was provided to
officers of Layne Christensen, the MinEx Tax Manager explained that on June 17, 2008,
following the issuance of the original tax assessment in May, the tax authorities suggested
WADS retain the same lawyers that it had used in 2006 to represent it in negotiating the tax
assessment. Shortly thereafter, without engagement letters or the approval of Layne
Christensenâs management, WADS retained both lawyers on a success-fee basis that tied their
compensation to the amount by which the assessment was reduced.

26. The MinEx Tax Manager also noted that a portion of the fees paid to the
lawyers could have been used to fund illegal payments to tax officials and that the lawyers and
the International Tax Consultants pressured WADS to make the payments to the lawyers in order
to obtain a settlement of the audit.

27. A few days later, the MinEx President learned that WADS had achieved a
substantial reduction in its tax assessment. On July 25, 2008, the Vice President of Operations
for Africa and Australia informed the MinEx President that the amount of the settled tax
assessment was materially different from the MinEx Divisionâs forecasted amount, could have a
material impact on Layne Christensenâs reported earnings, and could be scrutinized by Layne
Christensenâs auditors. The MinEx President also learned that WADS had retained the lawyers
without engagement letters. As with the Malian tax audits in 2005 and 2007, the MinEx
President did not question how the tax savings were achieved.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

28. In July 2009, Layne Drilling DRC made an improper payment of more
than $50,000 to tax officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (âDRCâ) through an agent
in order to reduce its liability for unpaid taxes and penalties.

29. After receiving a multi-million dollar tax assessment in June 2009, Layne
Drilling DRCâs local tax agent recommended that it engage a specialized lawyer to negotiate a
reduction in the assessment. On June 19, 2009, the MinEx CFO sought the approval of the
MinEx President to retain the lawyer as Layne Drilling DRCâs agent. Emphasizing that there
was âa lot at stake, potentially $millions,â the MinEx CFO explained that he had spoken to the
country manager and knew âmore than can be written down.â However, he wrote that the
transaction would entail paying $30,000 in taxes and $50,000 in legal commissions in an
arrangement similar to the arrangement made with the lawyers in Guinea the previous year. The
MinEx CFO also stated that all payments to the tax authorities would be made through the
lawyer. Without questioning either the need to retain an agent or the suspicious proposed
arrangement, the MinEx President approved Layne Drilling DRCâs retention of the lawyer.

30. On July 9, 2009, Layne Drilling DRC paid the lawyer $57,200 and falsely
recorded the payment as legal expense.
31. The next day, the DRC tax authority issued a revised final tax assessment
to Layne Drilling DRC. The amount of the revised tax assessment was substantially lower than
the assessment issued to Layne Drilling DRC in June 2009.

Payments to Reduce Customs Duties and Obtain Customs Clearance

32. Layne Christensen made multiple improper payments to customs officials
in Burkina Faso and the DRC between 2007 and 2010 in order to avoid paying customs duties
and to obtain clearance for the import and export of its equipment in these countries. Layne
Christensen made these improper payments through its customs clearing agents and falsely
recorded the payments as legal fees and agent commissions in its books and records.

BURKINA FASO

33. Burkina Fasoâs customs authority conducted an audit of WADS in June
2010. The auditors found that WADS had failed to comply with customs regulations relating to
the importation of certain goods and to pay sufficient customs duties on these items. As a result,
the customs authority assessed WADS nearly $2 million in unpaid duties and penalties.

34. Although WADS had retained a new customs clearing agent prior to
receiving this assessment, it engaged its former customs agent purportedly to negotiate a
reduction in the assessment. The former agent had cleared the disputed items but WADS
terminated it in or about May 2009 due, in part, to poor performance. Nevertheless, WADS
reengaged its former agent in June 2010 because the agentâs owner was well-connected with
customs authorities in Burkina Faso. In an email to the MinEx CFO, the WADS Finance
Manager described the agent as someone who is âwell Known in the game.â In addition, he
informed the MinEx CFO that WADS retained the agent on a success fee basis and would pay
the agent 10% of the difference between the original assessment and the final assessment.

35. On August 1, 2009, the MinEx CFO also told the MinEx President and
another senior employee that WADS had retained a third-party agent to negotiate a settlement of
the customs audit and the assessed customs duties were reduced from nearly $2 million to less
than $300,000. The MinEx CFO recommended that WADS accept this settlement and he sought
the approval of the MinEx President to send $300,000 to pay the customs fees and penalties as
well as $100,000 for the agentâs commission. Without questioning the identity of the agent, the
nature of the services provided, or the size of the commission, the MinEx President approved the
payments.

36. The MinEx CFO initiated cash calls to fund the payments and Layne
transferred funds from a U.S. bank account to WADS on August 4 and August 28, 2010.
Between August 4 and 20, 2010, WADS paid the agent a total of approximately $138,000,
including one cash payment. WADS falsely recorded the payments to the agent as legitimate
consultant fees in its books and records.
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
a. Importation of Drilling Rigs and Equipment

37. In 2007, Layne Drilling DRC made improper payments to customs
officials to obtain the initial importation of its drilling rigs and other equipment into the DRC.

38. In 2006 and 2007, Layne Drilling DRC encountered significant delays in
obtaining customs clearance for the importation of its equipment, which resulted in the WADS
Finance Manager terminating Layne Drilling DRCâs then-customs clearing agent and hiring a
new agent (âCustoms Clearance Agentâ) in March 2007. The new Customs Clearance Agent
was managed by the brother of a national government official in the DRC (âDRC Officialââ). In
an email to the MinEx President, the WADS Finance Manager said that he had found someone
who is âmore connectedâ and âcan get things moving for us.â As an example, he noted that the
Customs Clearance Agent had obtained clearance for two trucks in only two days whereas the
former agent had been unable to clear three trucks through customs for more than five weeks.

39, Between March and September 2007, Layne Drilling DRC paid a total of
approximately $124,000 to the Customs Clearance Agent for irregular expenses, described as
things such as âper diem,â âintervention expenses,â and âhonoraires,â that were not related to
specific invoices. Layne Drilling DRC paid the Customs Clearance Agent upon request and in
amounts dictated by the agent. In addition, on two occasions, Layne Drilling DRC made

payments to an unrelated third party in the U.S. at the direction of the Customs Clearance Agent.

AO. As a result of these payments, Layne Christensen was able to import
equipment necessary to perform on its existing contracts and derived more than $300,000 in
benefits in 2007.

41. Layne Drilling DRC inaccurately recorded these payments as legitimate
expenses relating to customs and clearance in its books and records.

b. Customs Clearance for Exports

42. Soon after beginning operations in the DRC in 2007, Layne Drilling DRC
hired the nephew of the DRC Official as an office manager. Internal documents describe the
DRC Official as Layne Drilling DRCâs âprotectorâ and show that Layne Drilling DRC hired the
DRC Officialâs nephew in order to facilitate a good relationship.

43. Between November 2007 and August 2008, the office manager approved
and made $18,000 in cash payments from Layne Drilling DRCâs account. These payments were
purportedly made based on invoices submitted by a local firm that had allegedly provided
customs clearance services but with whom Layne Drilling DRC had no written contract. Many
of the payments were made outside of Layne Drilling DRCâs vendor system. In addition, the
firmâs invoices were undated and included undefined âper diemâ and âhonoraireâ expenses,
similar to the invoices submitted by the Customs Clearance Agent. Layne improperly recorded
these payments as legitimate customs and clearance expenses.

c. Exportation of Equipment

44. In 2009 and 2010, Layne Drilling DRC made payments through its agents
to customs officials in order to secure the exportation of goods and equipment from the DRC to
Zambia.

45. In June 2009, Layne Drilling DRC retained a customs clearing agent to
facilitate the export of a drilling rig to Zambia on an expedited basis. However, when the
customs clearing agent indicated that the exportation would be delayed due to the lack of
documentation relating to the original importation of the drilling rig Layne Drilling DRC
replaced the agent.

46. Between July 10 and July 17, 2009, Layne Drilling DRC paid $7,186 to
the second agent who, in turn, made payments to customs officials and on July 20, 2009, the
drilling rig was successfully exported to Zambia and placed it into operations. Layne Drilling
DRC inaccurately recorded payments made to the agent as âgovernor office release rigâ and
ârelease documents for rig44.â

47. By making improper payments to customs officials to secure the export of
this drilling rig, Layne Drilling DRC realized benefits of approximately $145,000.

A8. Similarly, between April and November 2010, Layne Drilling DRC made
nearly $15,000 in improper payments, through its agent, to DRC officials in order to again obtain
clearance of goods for export to Zambia that lacked the proper import documentation. As
before, the agent provided invoices that included âhonorairesâ and âper diemsâ and the payments
were falsely recorded as legitimate customs and clearance expenses in Layneâs books and
records.

OTHER PAYMENTS

49. Between 2007 and 2010, Layne Christensen made more than $10,000 in
small payments to foreign officials through various customs and clearing agents that it used in
the Republic of Tanzania, Burkina Faso, the Republic of Mali, Mauritania, and the DRC. These
payments ranged from $4 to $1,700 and were characterized in invoices submitted by the agents
as, among other things, âintervention,â âhonoraires,â âcommissions,â and âservice fees.â

50. Between 2006 and 2010, Layne Christensen made more than $23,000 in
cash payments, through its subsidiaries, to police, border patrol, immigration officials, and labor
inspectors in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Tanzania, and the DRC to obtain border entry for its
equipment and employees, to secure work permits for its expatriate employees, and to avoid
penalties for noncompliance with local immigration and labor regulations.
LEGAL STANDARDS

C. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder or any other person that is, was, or would
be a cause of the violation due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such violation.

Violations of the Recordkeeping and Internal Controls Provisions of the FCPA

 

D. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and Keep books,
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
disposition of the assets of the issuer. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A).

E. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to devise and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; (11)
transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (11) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B).

F, As described above, Layne Christensen violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the
Exchange Act by falsely recording improper payments that its wholly-owned subsidiaries made to
foreign officials in Africa as legitimate expenses, including commissions, consulting fees, customs
and clearing expenses, border assistance, and freight fees. Layne Christensen also violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) by failing to devise and maintain sufficient accounting controls to detect and prevent
the making of these improper payments to foreign officials.

Violations of the Anti-Bribery Provision of the FCPA

 

G. Section 30A of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any issuer, officer, director,
employee, or agent of such issuer or any stockholder thereof acting on behalf of the issuer, to make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of
an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift,
promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any foreign official or any
person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given,
or promised, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official for the purposes of (i) influencing any act
or decision of such foreign official in his official capacity, (41) inducing such foreign official to do
or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official, or (1) securing any improper
advantage in order to assist such issuer in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing
business to, any person. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1.

10
H. Layne Christensen violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act by paying bribes,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and their agents, to foreign officials in multiple African
countries in order to obtain or retain business. From 2005 through 2010, with the knowledge and
approval of one of its corporate officers, Layne Christensen paid over $1 million in bribes to
foreign officials in order to, among other things, obtain favorable tax treatment, customs clearance
for its equipment, and a reduction in its customs duties. Layne Christensen funded many of these
improper payments by transferring money from its U.S. bank accounts to its wholly-owned
subsidiaries who, in turn, funneled cash to foreign officials through agents that the subsidiaries
retained.

REMEDIAL MEASURES AND COOPERATION

I. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.

J. Since 2010, Layne Christensen has implemented a number of remedial measures
designed to identify and mitigate bribery risks and to prevent FCPA violations in the future. Upon
learning of possible improper payments made to foreign officials by its staff in Africa, Layne
Christensenâs senior management and Audit Committee responded quickly by initiating an
investigation conducted by an outside law firm and forensic accounting experts, self-reporting its
preliminary findings to the Commission, and publicly disclosing its potential FCPA violations.
During the course of the investigation, Layne Christensen terminated four employees, including
the MinEx President, the MinEx CFO, and the WADS Finance Manager for their roles in the
misconduct, and reduced the compensation of the MinEx President for failing to establish a strong
compliance tone at the top. In addition, the Company conducted a comprehensive risk assessment
of its worldwide operations and implemented measures to address its most significant corruption
risks.

K. Layne Christensen also took affirmative steps to strengthen its internal compliance
policies, procedures, and controls. Layne Christensen issued a standalone anti-bribery policy and
procedures, improved its accounting policies relating to cash disbursements, implemented an
integrated accounting system worldwide, revamped its anti-corruption training, and conducted
extensive due diligence of third parties with which it does business. In addition, Layne
Christensen hired a dedicated chief compliance officer and three full-time compliance personnel
and retained a consulting firm to conduct an assessment of its anti-corruption program and make
recommendations.

L. Layne Christensen exhibited a high level of cooperation throughout the
Commissionâs investigation. In addition to self-reporting to the Commission shortly after it
discovered potential FCPA violations, Layne Christensen voluntarily provided the Commission
with real-time reports of its investigative findings, produced English language translations of
documents, made foreign witnesses available for interviews in the United States, shared
summaries of witness interviews and reports prepared by forensic consultants retained in
connection with the Companyâs internal investigation, and responded to the Commissionâs
requests for documents and information in a timely manner. These actions assisted the

11
Commission in efficiently collecting valuable evidence, including information that may not have
been otherwise available to the staff. Based on these factors, the Commission considered Layne
Christensenâs significant cooperation in determining to accept the Respondentâs Offer.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Layne Christensenâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A.

Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Layne Christensen cease
and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of
Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 8Â§
78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(2)(B), and 78dd-1].

Respondent shall, within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Order, pay
disgorgement of $3,893,472.42 which represents profits gained and losses avoided
as a result of the conduct described herein, prejudgment interest of $858,720.68,
and a civil money penalty of $375,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule
of Practice 600. Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

(1)

(2)

(3)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm;or

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Layne Christensen as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings;
a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Kara N. Brockmeyer, Chief,
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F St., NE, Washington, DC 20549-5646.

12
C.

Respondent undertakes to:

(1)

Report to the Commission periodically, at no less than nine-month
intervals during a two-year term, the status of its FCPA and _ anti-
corruption related remediation and implementation of compliance
measures. During this two-year period, should the Respondent discover
credible evidence, not already reported to the Commission, that
questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt transfers of
property or interests may have been offered, promised, paid, or authorized
by any Respondent entity or person, or any entity or person acting on
behalf of Respondent, or that related false books and records have been
maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to the
Commission staff. During this two-year period, Respondent shall (1)
conduct an initial review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and
prepare two follow-up reviews and reports, as described below:

a. Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a written report
within one 180 calendar days of the entry of this Order setting
forth a complete description of its remediation efforts to date, its
proposals reasonably designed to improve the policies and
procedures of Respondent for ensuring compliance with the FCPA
and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and the parameters of
the subsequent reviews (âthe âInitial Reportâ). The Initial Report
shall be transmitted to Charles E. Cain, Deputy Chief, FCPA Unit,
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission,
100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5030. Respondent may
extend the time period for issuance of the Initial Report with prior
written approval of the Commission staff.

b. Respondent shall undertake two follow-up reviews, incorporating
comments provided by the Commission on the previous report, to
further monitor and assess whether the policies and procedures of
the Respondent are reasonably designed to detect and prevent
violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws
(the âFollow-up Reportâ).

C. The Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later than 270
days after the Initial Report. The second Follow-Up Report shall
be completed by no later than 270 days after the completion of the
first Follow-Up Report. Respondent may extend the time period
for issuance of the Follow-up Report with prior written approval of
the Commission staff.

d. The periodic reviews and reports submitted by Respondent will
likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive

13
business information. Public disclosure of the reports could
discourage cooperation, impede pending or potential government
investigations or undermine the objectives of the reporting
requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-
public, except (a) pursuant to court order, (b) as agreed by the
parties in writing, (c) to the extent that the Commission staff
determines in its sole discretion that disclosure would be in
furtherance of the Commissionâs discharge of its duties, or (d) is
otherwise required by law.

(2) Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertaking(s) set forth above.
The certification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide written
evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by
exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The Commission staff may
make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and
Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and
supporting material shall be submitted to Charles E. Cain, Deputy Chief,
FCPA Unit, with a copy to the Office of Chief Counsel of the
Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the
completion of the undertakings.

D. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in
excess of $375,000 based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation and
related enforcement action. If at any time following the entry of the Order, the
Division of Enforcement (âDivisionâ) obtains information indicating that
Respondent knowingly provided materially false or misleading information or
materials to the Commission or in a related proceeding, the Division may, at its
sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission
to reopen this matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay an
additional civil penalty. Respondent may contest by way of defense in any
resulting administrative proceeding whether it knowingly provided materially
false or misleading information, but may not: (1) contest the findings in the Order;
or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to any
statute of limitations defense.

By the Commission.

SEC Charges Texas-Based Layne Christensen Company With
FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2014-240

Washington D.C., Oct. 27, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a global water management, construction, and
drilling company headquartered in Texas with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by making improper payments to foreign
officials in several African countries in order to obtain beneficial treatment and reduce its tax liability.

After Layne Christensen Company self-reported its misconduct, an SEC investigation determined that the company received approximately
$3.9 million in unlawful benefits during a five-year period as a result of bribes typically paid through its subsidiaries in Africa and Australia.
Some payments were funded through cash transfers from Layneâs U.S. bank accounts.

In addition to self-reporting the misconduct, Layne cooperated with the SECâs investigation by providing real-time reports of its investigative
findings, producing English language translations of documents, and making foreign witnesses available. The company also undertook an
extensive remediation effort. Layne agreed to pay more than $5 million to settle the SECâs charges.

âLayneâs lack of internal controls allowed improper payments to government officials in multiple countries to continue unabated for five
years,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âHowever, Layne self-reported its violations, cooperated
fully with our investigation, and revamped its FCPA compliance program. Those measures were credited in determining the appropriate
remedy.â

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Layneâs misconduct occurred from 2005 to 2010. In addition to
favorable tax treatment, the improper payments helped the company obtain customs clearance, work permits, and relief from inspections by
immigration and labor officials in various African countries.

Among the findings in the SECâs order:

e Layne paid nearly $800,000 to foreign officials in Mali, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to reduce its tax
liability and avoid associated penalties for delinquent payment. The bribes enabled Layne to realize more than $3.2 million in improper
tax savings.

e Layne made improper payments to customs officials in Burkina Faso and the DRC to avoid paying customs duties and obtain clearance
to import and export its equipment. The bribes were falsely recorded as legal fees and commissions in the companyâs books and
records.

e Layne paid more than $23,000 in cash to police, border patrol, immigration officials, and labor inspectors in Burkina Faso, Guinea,
Tanzania, and the DRC to obtain border entry for its equipment and employees. The bribes also helped secure work permits for its
expatriate employees and avoid penalties for non-compliance with local immigration and labor regulations.

The SECâs order finds that Layne violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Layne agreed to pay $3,893,472.42 in disgorgement plus $858,720 in prejudgment interest as well as a $375,000 penalty amount
that reflects Layneâs self-reporting, remediation, and significant cooperation with the SECâs investigation. For a period of two years, the
settlement requires the company to report to the SEC on the status of its remediation and implementation of measures to comply with the
FCPA. Layne consented to the order without admitting or denying the SECâs findings.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-

In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
BIO-RAD LABORATORIES, EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
INC., FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A

CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER
Respondent.

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (âBio-
Radâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over the Respondent and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the
entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(âOrderâ), as set forth below.
Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (the âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd] by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (âBio-Radâ) concerning
medical diagnostic and life science equipment sales to government customers in Russia,
Vietnam, and Thailand.

2. From approximately 2005 to 2010, subsidiaries of Bio-Rad made unlawful
payments in Vietnam and Thailand to obtain or retain business. During the same period, Bio-
Radâs subsidiary paid certain Russian third parties, disregarding the high probability that at least
some of the money would be used to make unlawful payments to government officials in Russia.
With respect to Russia, one of Bio-Radâs foreign subsidiaries paid three off-shore agents (the
âRussian Agentsâ) for alleged services in connection with sales of its medical diagnostic and life
science equipment to government agencies. These agents were not legitimate businesses, and
despite receiving large commissions, they did not provide the contracted-for services. In paying
these agents, Bio-Radâs foreign subsidiary demonstrated a conscious disregard for the high
probability that the Russian Agents were using at least a portion of the commissions to pay
foreign officials to obtain profitable government contracts. The General Manager (âGMâ) of
Bio-Radâs Emerging Markets sub-division and the Emerging Markets Controller, both
employees of the parent company (collectively, âthe Emerging Markets managersâ) ignored red
flags, which permitted the scheme to continue for years. In Vietnam and Thailand, Bio-Radâs
foreign subsidiaries used agents and distributors to funnel money to government officials. In
total, Bio-Rad made $35.1 million in illicit profits from these improper payments.

3. In violation of Bio-Radâs policies, Bio-Radâs foreign subsidiaries did not record
the payments in their own books in a manner that would accurately or fairly reflect the
transactions. Instead they booked them as commissions, advertising, and training fees. These
subsidiariesâ books were consolidated into the parent companyâs books and records. During the
relevant period, Bio-Rad also failed to devise and maintain adequate internal accounting
controls.

Respondent

4. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (âBio-Radâ) is a corporation organized under the
laws of the state of Delaware. Bio-Radâs corporate headquarters is Hercules, California. Bio-
Rad issues and maintains a class of publicly traded securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

 

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2
Other Relevant Entities and Persons

5. Bio-Rad SNC is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Bio-Rad headquartered
in Marnes-La-Coquette, France. Bio-Rad SNC manufactures, sells, and distributes Bio-Rad
products. During the relevant time period, Bio-Rad SNC manufactured the products sold to the
Russian government, contracted with the off-shore agents in Russia, and paid their sales
commissions. Bio-Rad SNCâs books, records, and financial accounts are consolidated into Bio-
Radâs books and records and reported by Bio-Rad in its financial statements.

6. Bio-Rad Laboratorii OOO (âBio-Rad Russiaâ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Bio-Rad located in Moscow, Russia. Bio-Rad Russiaâs books, records, and financial accounts
are consolidated into Bio-Radâs books and records and reported by Bio-Rad in its financial
statements.

7. Agents A, B, and C (collectively, the âRussian Agentsâ) were incorporated in the
United Kingdom, Belize, and Panama, respectively. They contracted with Bio-Rad SNC to
assist Bio-Rad Russia in the sale of Bio-Rad products to the Russian government.

8. Bio-Rad Laboratories (Singapore) Pte. Limited (âBio-Rad Singaporeâ) is
Bio-Radâs wholly-owned subsidiary, located in Singapore. Bio-Rad Singaporeâs books, records,
and financial accounts are consolidated into Bio-Radâs books and records and reported by Bio-
Rad in its financial statements.

9, Diamed South East Asia Ltd. (âDiamed Thailandâ) was a 49%-owned
subsidiary of Diamed AG (Switzerland) that was acquired by Bio-Rad in October 2007. Local
majority owners ran Diamed Thailandâs operations until 2011, when Bio-Rad bought out their
interest in the company. Diamed Thailandâs financial statements are consolidated into those of
Bio-Rad.

Background

10. Bio-Rad is a life science research and clinical diagnostics company that operates
in two industry segments, Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics, in the United States and
internationally. Bio-Radâs Clinical Diagnostics segment, which designs, manufactures and sells
diagnostic testing kits and systems to clinical laboratories and hospitals, accounts for the
majority of Bio-Radâs net sales, and almost the entirety of the unlawful payments at issue in this
Order.

11. Bio-Radâs international sales organization (âISOâ) oversees the companyâs
international sales operations; this includes all locations outside the United States and Canada.
In 2009, the ISO consisted of four sub-divisions: (1) Western Europe; (2) Asia Pacific; (3)
Japan; and (4) Emerging Markets. Each sub-division had a general manager, reporting to the
vice-president of ISO. The Asia Pacific sub-division included Vietnam and Thailand. The
Emerging Markets sub-division included Russia and other eastern European countries. Some
countries within the sub-divisions had a country manager who reported to the ISO sub-division
general manager.
12. â_ Bio-Radâs total consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2013
was $77.8 million, with gross revenues of $2.1 billion.

Unlawful Payments in Russia

13. From 2005 to the beginning of 2010, a substantial portion of Bio-Rad Russiaâs
business consisted of sales of clinical diagnostic products to the Russian government. Those
sales arose from government contracts awarded to Bio-Rad Russia through a public tender offer
process that required approval from various government officials. Bio-Rad Russiaâs largest
contracts with the Russian government were national contracts awarded by the Russian Ministry
of Health for the sale of HIV testing equipment and blood bank equipment. The clinical
diagnostic products sold to the Russian government were manufactured by Bio-Rad SNC, which
in many instances also sold them directly to the Russian government due to certain complexities
with Russian regulations and tax laws. Those sales were recorded on Bio-Rad SNCâs financial
records. Other sales made by Bio-Rad Russia were recorded in the first instance on Bio-Rad
Russiaâs financial books.

14. During the relevant time period, Bio-Rad Russia had a country manager, who
reported to the GM of Emerging Markets. From 2005 to 2006, the Emerging Markets GM, along
with the Emerging Marketsâ Controller, worked out of Bio-Rad SNCâs offices. After that, they
worked out of Bio-Radâs corporate offices in the United States.

The Unlawful Payments Scheme

 

15. From at least 2005 to the beginning of 2010, Bio-Rad SNC paid the Russian
Agents commissions of 15%-30% while demonstrating a conscious disregard for the high
probability that the Russian Agents were passing along at least a portion of their commissions to
Russian government officials to obtain profitable public contracts for the sale of medical
diagnostic equipment. The scheme began prior to 2005, orchestrated by the then country
manager, who used the Russian Agents, primarily for their influence in connection with the
tenders for the government contracts. The Russian Agents were foreign entities with bank
accounts in Latvia and Lithuania, all affiliated with the same individual. The Russian Agents
entered into agreements to provide various services to Bio-Rad Russia including acquiring new
business, creating and disseminating promotional materials to prospective customers, distributing
and installing products and related equipment, and training customers. The Russian Agents,
however, had no offices in Russia, no employees, and therefore, likely no capability to perform
the services outlined in their contracts. One of the Russian Agents even used a phony office
address in Moscow that was actually the office address for a Russian government building.

16. After the country manager died in or about 2007, his successor continued to make
payments to the Russian Agents. He knew from discussions with colleagues in the Russian
health care industry that the Russian Agentsâ principal had important contacts at the Russian
Ministry of Health, and could influence the tender offer specifications and selection process. He
performed no additional due diligence on the Russian Agents prior to signing subsequent
agreements with them. Some documents suggest that the Russian Agents may have performed
distribution services in connection with a few of the contracts. The new country manager
estimated in an email to the Emerging Markets GM that Bio-Radâs distribution costs ranged
between 2%-2.5% in one instance. However, Bio-Rad SNC paid the Agents commissions of
15%-30%.

17. Both Russian country managers made extensive efforts to conceal matters relating
to the Russian Agents. For example, no one other than the Russian country managers
communicated with the Russian Agents and the country managers maintained no records of the
Russian Agents. The new country manager used at least ten different personal email addresses
with aliases when communicating about the Russian Agents with the Emerging Markets
managers. He also used code words like âbad debtsâ when referring to the Russian Agentsâ
commissions. The Russian country managers knew or disregarded the high probability that the
Russian Agents were using at least a portion of the sales commission payments to bribe Russian
government officials in exchange for awarding the company profitable government contracts.

18. The Russian Agents received a total of $4.6 million on sales of $38.6 million.
These unlawful payments were made by Bio-Rad SNC and recorded as commission payments on
its books. These payments continued unabated until the beginning of 2010 when Bio-Rad Russia
terminated the services of the Russian Agents. Immediately after that, Bio-Rad Russia lost its
first government contract in Russia.

The Red Flags

19. Throughout the relevant time period, the Emerging Markets managers, who were
employees of Bio-Rad, ignored repeated red flags regarding the high probability that the Russian
Agents were making improper payments to government officials to win public tender offers for
government contracts on behalf of Bio-Rad Russia. Specifically, they knew that the Russian
Agents were foreign companies and that the Agents did not have the resources to perform the
contracted-for services. They also knew that their commissions were excessive and were paid to
banks in Latvia and Lithuania. Additionally, they condoned the secrecy surrounding the Russian
Agents, and even encouraged it. For example, the Emerging Markets Controller sent an email to
a lower-level Bio-Rad SNC employee instructing her to âtalk with codesâ when communicating
about the Russian Agentsâ invoices.

20. Furthermore, the Emerging Markets managers knew that the Russian country
manager often requested approval for the Russian Agentsâ commissions in installments of less
than $200,000. These managers should have recognized that this was an attempt to bypass an
additional approval tier by Bio-Radâs corporate controller, as required by Bio-Radâs internal
controls. Additionally, the Russian country manager sometimes requested payments to the
Russian Agents even before Bio-Rad Russia had collected on the underlying sales contracts. The
Emerging Markets managers should have known that pre-paying the commission was not
normal, and it suggested the possibility of a bribe payment. The practice also violated the
express terms of the Russian Agentsâ contracts.

21. The Emerging Markets managers also knew that many of the contracted-for
services were not necessary to Bio-Rad Russiaâs business with the Russian government. Many
of the clinical diagnostic products required limited installation or training; additionally, Bio-Rad
Russia used a separate distributor for several of the same government contracts during the
relevant time period, thereby obviating the need for an additional distributor. Finally, the
Emerging Markets managers knew that some of the Russian Agentsâ invoices were generated
internally at Bio-Rad Russia.

22. Despite the red flags, which surfaced repeatedly over five years, the Emerging
Markets managers approved all of the payments to the Russian Agents. They also reviewed,
negotiated, and approved the Russian Agentsâ contracts.

Other Internal Controls Deficiencies

 

23. In many instances where the corporate controllerâs approval was needed for
payments of over $200,000 to the Russian Agents, the Emerging Markets controller merely sent
an email request for the payment to be approved, without supplying the underlying contracts and
invoices. Nevertheless, the corporate controller approved payments to the Russian Agents,
relying solely on the Emerging Markets controllerâs prior review of the supporting documents.

24. |The Emerging Markets GM instructed Bio-Rad Russiaâs country manager to sign
the consulting agreements with the Russian Agents on behalf of Bio-Rad SNC. He did this in
direct violation of the internal policies and procedures that required Bio-Rad SNCâs GM to sign
such agreements or, alternatively, to grant a power of attorney to the Bio-Rad senior manager to
sign them.

25. The same Emerging Markets GM failed to provide Bio-Rad SNCâs legal and
finance departments with translated copies of the agreements with the Russian Agents in
violation of Bio-Radâs internal policies and procedures. Nevertheless, for five years Bio-Radâs
finance department approved the Russian Agentsâ sales commission payments.

26. From 2005 to the beginning of 2010, the Emerging Markets managers signed and
submitted sub-certifications to Bio-Radâs chief financial officer attesting that Bio-Rad Russiaâs
balance sheets and income statements were fairly presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The
sub-certifications also stated that these managers were responsible for establishing and
maintaining Bio-Rad Russiaâs internal controls, which the documents described as âadequateâ
and âfunctioning as needed.â

Facts in Vietnam

27. From at least 2005 to the end of 2009, Bio-Rad maintained a sales representative
office in Vietnam. A country manager supervised the Vietnam Officeâs sales activities, and was
authorized to approve contracts up to $100,000 and sales commissions up to $20,000. Vietnamâs
country manager reported to Bio-Rad Singaporeâs Southeast Asia regional sales manager
(âRSMâ), who in turn reported to the Asia Pacific GM.

28. From 2005 through 2009, the country manager of the Vietnam office authorized
the payment of bribes to government officials to obtain their business. At the direction of the
country manager, the sales representatives made cash payments to officials at government-owned
hospitals and laboratories in exchange for their agreement to buy Bio-Radâs products.

29. In 2006, the RSM first learned of this practice from a finance employee. She
raised concerns about it to the Vietnam Officeâs country manager, who informed her that paying

6
bribes was a customary practice in Vietnam. On or about May 18, 2006, the Vietnamese country
manager wrote in an email to the RSM and the Bio-Rad Singapore finance employee that paying
third party fees â[wa]s outlawed in the Bio-Rad Business Ethics Policy,â but that Bio-Rad would
lose 80% of its Vietnam sales without continuing the practice. In that same email, the country
manager proposed a solution that entailed employing a middleman to pay the bribes to
Vietnamese government officials as a means of insulating Bio-Rad from liability. Under the
proposed scheme, Bio-Rad Singapore would sell Bio-Rad products to a Vietnamese distributor at
a deep discount, which the distributor would then resell to government customers at full price,
and pass through a portion of it as bribes.

30. The RSM and the Asia Pacific GM were aware of and allowed the payments to
continue. Between 2005 and the end of 2009, the Vietnam office made improper payments of
$2.2 million to agents or distributors, which was funneled to Vietnamese government officials.
These bribes, recorded as âcommissions,â âadvertising fees,â and âtraining fees,â generated
gross sales revenues of $23.7 million to Bio-Rad Singapore. The payment scheme did not
involve the use of interstate commerce, and no United States national was involved in the
misconduct.

Facts in Thailand

31. Bio-Rad acquired a 49% interest in Diamed Thailand as part of its acquisition of
Diamed AG (Switzerland) in October 2007. Bio-Rad performed very little due diligence on
Diamed Thailand prior to the acquisition.

32. | Diamed Thailandâs local majority owners managed the subsidiary. Bio-Radâs
Asia Pacific GM was responsible for working and communicating with Diamed Thailandâs
majority owners and distributors.

33. Prior to the October 2007 acquisition, Diamed Thailand had an established
bribery scheme, whereby Diamed Thailand used a Thai agent to sell diagnostic products to
government customers. The agent received an inflated 13% commission, of which it retained
4%, and paid 9% to Thai government officials in exchange for profitable business contracts.

34. The scheme continued even after Bio-Rad acquired Diamed Thailand. Diamed
Thailand renewed the contract with the distributor in June 2008, but unbeknownst to Bio-Rad,
the distributor was partially owned by one of Diamed Thailandâs local Thai owners.

35.  Bio-Radâs Asia Pacific GM learned of Diamed Thailandâs bribery scheme while
attending a distributorâs conference in Bangkok in March 2008. At the conference, Diamed
Thailandâs local manager informed him that some of Diamed Thailandâs customers received
payments, which the Asia Pacific GM understood to mean kickbacks. The Asia Pacific GM
instructed Bio-Rad Singaporeâs controller to investigate the matter. The controller confirmed to
the Asia Pacific GM that Diamed Thailand was bribing government officials through the
distributor. Despite these findings, the Asia Pacific GM did not instruct Diamed Thailand to stop
making the improper payments to the distributor.

36. From 2007 to early 2010, Diamed Thailand improperly paid a total of $708,608 to
the distributor, generating gross sales revenues of $5.5 million to Diamed Thailand. These

7
payments were recorded as sales commissions. The payment scheme did not involve the use of
interstate commerce, and no United States national was involved in the misconduct.

Legal Standards and Violations

A. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a
cease-and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act of omission the person knew or
should have known would contribute to such violation.

FCPA Violations

B. Under Section 30A(a) of the Exchange Act it is unlawful for any issuer, officer,
director, employee, or agent of such issuer or any stockholder thereof acting on behalf of the
issuer, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly
in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any
money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any
foreign official or any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of
value will be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official for the
purposes of (1) influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in his official capacity, (11)
inducing such foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such
official, or (111) securing any improper advantage in order to assist such issuer in obtaining or
retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

C. Additionally, under Section 30A(f)(2), a âknowingâ state of mind as to a
circumstance may be established âif a person is aware of a high probability of the existence of
such circumstance, unless the person actually believes that such circumstance does not exist.â

D. As described above, Bio-Rad violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act because
Bio-Radâs Emerging Markets managers demonstrated a conscious disregard for the high
probability that the Russian Agents were using at least a portion of Bio-Rad Russiaâs sales
commission payments to bribe Russian government officials in exchange for awarding the
company profitable government contracts. These managers knew the Russian Agents operated
as mere shell entities. They also knew that, among other things, the commissions were large, and
that the Russian Agents did not have the resources to perform any of the contracted-for services
set forth in their agreements. Nevertheless, the managers approved all of their agreements, and
authorized $4.6 million in payments to the Russian Agentsâ off-shore accounts even though
many of the payment requests and invoices raised substantial questions as to their legitimacy.
Finally, the same Emerging Markets managers communicated about the Russian Agents under
cover of secrecy, which further calls in question their legitimacy. These red flags surfaced
repeatedly over a five year period.

E. Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].
F., As described above, Bio-Rad violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.
Its subsidiaries falsely recorded the payments to the agents/distributors as payments for
legitimate services or commissions, when the true purpose of these payments was to make
corrupt payments to government officials to obtain business. The false entries were then
consolidated and reported by Bio-Rad in its consolidated financial statements.

G. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(1) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization;
(11) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

H. Bio-Rad violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) because although it had an ethics policy
prohibiting the payment of bribes and various policies and procedures requiring accurate books
and records, its systems of internal controls proved insufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that such payments would be detected and prevented.

Bio-Radâs Self-Disclosure, Cooperation, and Remedial Efforts

I. Bio-Rad made an initial voluntary self-disclosure of potential FCPA violations to
the Commission staff and the Department of Justice in May 2010, and immediately thereafter
Bio-Radâs audit committee retained independent counsel to conduct an investigation of the
alleged violations. The audit committee conducted a thorough internal investigation, and
subsequently expanded it voluntarily to cover a large number of additional potentially high-risk
countries. The investigation included over 100 in-person interviews, the collection of millions of
documents, the production of tens of thousands of documents, and forensic auditing. Bio-Radâs
cooperation was extensive, including voluntarily producing documents from overseas,
summarizing its findings, translating numerous key documents, producing witnesses from
foreign jurisdictions, providing timely reports on witness interviews, and making employees
available to the Commission staff to interview.

J. Bio-Rad also undertook significant and extensive remedial actions including:
terminating problematic practices; terminating Bio-Rad employees who were involved in the
misconduct; comprehensively re-evaluating and supplementing its anti-corruption policies and
procedures on a world-wide basis, including its relationship with intermediaries; enhancing its
internal controls and compliance functions; developing and implementing FCPA compliance
procedures, including the further development and implementation of policies and procedures
such as the due diligence and contracting procedure for intermediaries and policies concerning
hospitality, entertainment, travel, and other business courtesies; and conducting extensive
anti-corruption training throughout the organization world-wide.
Criminal Disposition

K. Bio-Rad has agreed, with the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section, to enter into a Non-Prosecution Agreement to resolve potential criminal
liability for conduct relating to certain of the findings in the Order.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Bio-Radâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Bio-Rad cease and
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 30A,
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act;

B. Respondent shall pay, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, disgorgement of
$35,100,000 and prejudgment interest of $5,600,000 to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. If timely payment of disgorgement is not made, additional interest shall accrue
pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600. Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission,
which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon
request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Alka N. Patel,
Assistant Regional Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission,
5670 Wilshire Boulevard, Eleventh Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036.

C. Respondent shall report to the Commission staff periodically, at no less than

twelve-month intervals during a two-year term, the status of its remediation and implementation
of compliance measures. Should Respondent discover credible evidence, not already reported to

10
the Commission staff, that questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt transfers
of property or interests may have been offered, promised, paid, or authorized by Respondent
entity or person, or any entity or person while working directly for Respondent, or that related
false books and records have been maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to
the Commission staff. During this two-year period, Respondent shall: (1) conduct an initial
review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least one (1) follow-up review
and report, as described below:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a written report within
one (1) year of the entry of this Order setting forth a complete description
of its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) and anti-corruption related
remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve
the policies and procedures of Respondent for ensuring compliance with
the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and the parameters of
the subsequent reviews (the âInitial Reportâ). The Initial Report shall be
transmitted to Alka N. Patel, Assistant Director, Division of Enforcement,
United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 5670 Wilshire Blvd.,
11th floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036. Respondent may extend the time
period for issuance of the Initial Report with prior written approval of the
Commission staff.

Respondent shall undertake at least one (1) follow-up review,
incorporating any comments provided by the Commission staff on the
previous report, to further monitor and assess whether the policies and
procedures of Respondent are reasonably designed to detect and prevent
violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws (the
âFollow-up Reportâ).

The Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later than one (1) year
after the Initial Report. Respondent may extend the time period for
issuance of the Follow-up Report with prior written approval of the
Commission staff.

Respondentâs reporting obligations pursuant to the Order, and its
concurrent reporting obligations pursuant to the resolutions of certain of
its subsidiaries with the U.S. Department of Justice, shall each be satisfied
by the simultaneous submission of the same reports to both the
Commission staff and the Department of Justice.

The periodic reviews and reports submitted by Respondent will likely
include proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive business
information. Public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations or
undermine the objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons,
among others, the reports and the contents thereof are intended to remain
and shall remain non-public, except (1) pursuant to court order, (2) as
agreed by the parties in writing, (3) to the extent that the Commission staff

11
determines in its sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of
the Commissionâs discharge of its duties and responsibilities, or (4) is
otherwise required by law.

SEC Charges California-Based Bio-Rad Laboratories With FCPA
Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-245

Washington D.C., Nov. 3, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a clinical diagnostic and life science research
company based in California with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries made improper payments to foreign
officials in Russia, Vietnam, and Thailand in order to win business.

An SEC investigation found that Bio-Rad Laboratories lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent or detect approximately $7.5 million in
bribes that were paid during a five-year period and improperly recorded in books and records as legitimate expenses like commissions,
advertising, and training fees. The improper payments enabled Bio-Rad to earn $35 million in illicit profits.

Bio-Rad, which self-reported its misconduct and extensively cooperated during the investigation, agreed to pay $55 million to settle the SECâs
charges and a parallel action announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âBio-Rad Laboratories failed to detect a bribery scheme and did not properly address red flags that such a scheme was underway,â said
Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThis enforcement action, which reflects credit for Bio-Radâs cooperation
in our investigation, reiterates the importance of all companies ensuring they have the proper internal controls to prevent FCPA violations.â

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Bio-Rad made excessive payments disguised as commissions to
foreign agents with phony Moscow addresses and off-shore bank accounts. The agents had no employees and no capacity to perform the
purported services for Bio-Rad, and were retained primarily to influence Russiaâs Ministry of Health and help the company win bids for
government contracts. Bio-Rad managers repeatedly ignored various red flags indicating that the Russian agents were likely bribing
government officials, and they condoned an atmosphere of secrecy. Country managers were allowed to communicate through at least 10
different personal e-mail addresses with aliases, and referred to the commissions with code words such as âbad debts.â

According to the SECâs order, Bio-Rad employees used local intermediaries in Vietnam and Thailand to funnel bribes through to foreign
officials in exchange for business. Bio-Radâs Singapore subsidiary sold products at a deep discount to Vietnamese distributors, who passed
through a portion of it as bribes. Bio-Rad acquired a company in Thailand and failed to uncover a pre-existing bribery scheme in which Thai
agents received inflated commissions that were partially used for improper payments.

The SECâs order finds that Bio-Rad, headquartered in Hercules, Calif., violated the anti-bribery, internal controls, and books and records
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company agreed to pay $40.7 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to
the SEC, and a $14.35 million criminal fine to the Department of Justice. The company also must report its FCPA compliance efforts to the
SEC for a period of two years.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by FCPA Unit members Catherine W. Brilliant and Alka N. Patel in the Los Angeles office. The SEC
appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice as well as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Bank of Lithuania, Financial and Capital Market Commission of Latvia, and British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission.

Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by Bruker. The violations took place
from at least 2005 through 2011 and occurred throughout Brukerâs China operations. Employees
of the China offices of four Bruker subsidiaries (collectively, the âBruker China Officesâ) made
unlawful payments of approximately $230,938 to government officials (âChinese government
officialsâ) who were employed by state owned entities (âSOEsâ) in China that were Bruker
customers. These payments were made to obtain or retain business from the SOEs for the Bruker
China Offices. Specifically, all of the Bruker China Offices provided non-business related travel to
Chinese government officials, and one Bruker China Office also paid Chinese government officials
under âresearch cooperationâ ventures and âcollaborationâ agreements (collectively, the
âCollaboration Agreementsâ) for which there was no legitimate business purpose. Bruker realized
approximately $1.7 million in profits from sales contracts with SOEs whose officials received the
improper payments.

2. The payments to the Chinese government officials were recorded as legitimate
business and marketing expenses in the Bruker China Officesâ books and records, when in fact
they were improper payments designed to personally benefit the officials. The Bruker China
Officesâ books and records were consolidated into Brukerâs books and records, thereby causing
Brukerâs books and records to be inaccurate. Bruker failed to devise and maintain an adequate
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to prevent and detect the improper payments that
occurred over several years.

Respondent

3. Bruker Corporation is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Billerica,
Massachusetts. Bruker designs, manufactures, and markets analytical tools and life science and
materials research systems (e.g., infrared spectrometers and microscopes) and maintains operations
in North America, Europe, and China. Bruker manages its China operations through the Shanghai
and Beijing representative offices of the Asia-based subsidiaries of four Bruker divisions: Bruker
Optics, Bruker BioSpin, Bruker Daltonics, and Bruker Materials (formerly Bruker AXS). Brukerâs
common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act
and is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (ticker: BRKR).

Facts

A. The Bruker China Offices Improperly Funded
Leisure Travel for Chinese Government Officials

4. The Bruker China Offices funded leisure travel for Chinese government officials to
visit the United States, the Czech Republic, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland and
Italy. These leisure trips typically followed business-related travel funded by the Bruker China
Offices. The Chinese government officials who went on the trips often authorized the purchase of

2
products from the Bruker China Offices. For example, during 2006, as part of a sales contract with
an SOE, a Bruker China Office paid for purported training expenses for a Chinese government
official (who signed the sales contract on behalf of the SOE). In fact, the payment included
reimbursement for sightseeing, tour tickets, shopping and other leisure activities in Frankfurt and
Paris. Also, in 2007, a Bruker China Office paid for three Chinese government officials to visit
Sweden for a conference, but included as part of the travel, several days of sightseeing in Sweden,
Finland, and Norway.

5. The Bruker China Offices also funded certain trips for Chinese government
officials that had no legitimate business component. For example, during 2009, a Bruker China
Office paid for two Chinese government officials to travel to New York, despite the lack of any
Bruker facilities there, and to Los Angeles, where they engaged in sightseeing activities. Also
during 2009, a Bruker China Office paid for three Chinese government officials to visit
destinations in Europe for sightseeing. In another instance, during 2010, a Bruker China Office
paid for three Chinese government officials to visit Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Munich,
in Germany, as well as Salzburg, Liz, Innsbruck, Graz, and Vienna, in Austria. And in 2011, a
Bruker China Office paid for Chinese government officials from seven SOEs to go on sightseeing
visits to Europe, including Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, and the Czech Republic. In certain
cases, the Chinese government officials who went on these trips were involved in purchasing
products from the Bruker China Offices.

6. Overall, from 2005 through 2011, the Bruker China Offices paid approximately
$119,710 to fund 17 trips for Chinese government officials that were for the most part not related
to any legitimate business purpose. These trips were recorded in Brukerâs books and records as
business expenses, without any indication that they were primarily for sightseeing and other non-
business related activities. Bruker improperly profited by $1,131,740 from contracts obtained from
the SOEs whose officials participated on these trips.

B. A Bruker China Office Improperly Funneled Payments to Officials of
SOEs Under the Guise of Collaboration and Research Agreements

7. From 2008 through 2011, a Bruker China Office paid $111,228 to Chinese
government officials pursuant to 12 suspect Collaboration Agreements. Generally, under these
Collaboration Agreements, the SOEs had to provide research on Bruker products, or had to use
Bruker products in demonstration laboratories. However, the Collaboration Agreements did not
specify the work product that the SOEs had to provide to be paid, and no work product was in fact
provided to the Bruker China Office by the SOEs. Also, certain Collaboration Agreements were
executed directly with a Chinese government official, rather than the SOE itself; in some cases, the
Bruker China Office paid the Chinese government official directly. And at times, the Chinese
government officials who signed the Collaboration Agreements or obtained payments under the
Agreements were involved in purchasing products from the Bruker China Office. Bruker profited
by approximately $583,112 from contracts improperly obtained from the SOEs whose officials
received payments under the Collaboration Agreements.
C. Bruker Failed to Implement an Adequate Internal Controls System

8. From at least 2005 through 2011, Bruker failed to implement an adequate internal
controls system to address the potential FCPA problems posed by its ownership of the Bruker
China Offices, which sold their products primarily to SOEs. For example, Bruker did not translate
its training presentations on FCPA, ethics, or compliance issues into local languages, including
Mandarin. And although Bruker implemented an FCPA policy in 2006, it failed to translate that
policy into Mandarin and relied mainly on its China-based managers to ensure that employees
understood the potential FCPA implications of doing business with SOEs. Also, while Bruker
periodically distributed its Code of Conduct (containing its gifts and entertainment policies) and
employee handbook to employees worldwide, it again failed to translate these documents into local
languages, including Chinese. Likewise, Brukerâs toll free employee hotline, which employees
were to use to report complaints anonymously, was not provided in Mandarin, limiting its efficacy.

9. Bruker also failed to adequately monitor and supervise the senior executives at the
Bruker China Offices to ensure that they enforced anti-corruption policies or kept accurate records
concerning payments to Chinese government officials. The Bruker China Offices had no
independent compliance staff or an internal audit function that had authority to intervene into
management decisions and, if appropriate, take remedial actions. Bruker also failed to tailor its
preapproval processes for conditions in China, instead allowing the Bruker China Offices approval
over items such as nonemployee travel and changes to contracts. As a result, senior employees of
the Bruker China Offices had unsupervised control over the compliance process; these employees
in turn abused their privileges, approving suspect payments to Chinese government officials for
non-business related travel and for purported Collaboration Agreements.

D. Discovery, Internal Investigation, and Self-Reporting

10. Bruker discovered the improper payments to Chinese government officials during
2011 while investigating the misappropriation of company funds by certain employees of a Bruker
China Office. Upon learning about these payments, Brukerâs board of directors promptly initiated
an investigation, with the assistance of independent outside counsel and an independent forensic
consulting firm. Bruker self-reported the preliminary results of its internal investigation to both the
staff of the Commission and to the Department of Justice. Thereafter, Bruker, on its own initiative,
undertook a broad review of the China operations of its other divisions. To the extent this internal
review identified additional issues of concern, Bruker fully shared its findings with the staff.

11. As part of its internal review and investigation, Bruker promptly undertook
significant remedial measures including terminating the senior staff at each of the Bruker China
Offices. Bruker also revised its pre-existing compliance program, updated and enhanced its
financial accounting controls and its compliance protocols and policies, and implemented those
enhancements in China, and thereafter around the world. These steps included: (1) instituting pre-
approval processes for nonemployee travel and significant changes to contracts; (2) establishing a
new internal audit function and hiring a new director of internal audit who is charged with
oversight over Brukerâs global compliance program, including FCPA compliance; (3) adopting an

4
amended FCPA policy translated into local languages; (4) implementing an enhanced FCPA
training program, which includes training programs in local languages as well as mandatory online
employee training programs regarding ethics and FCPA compliance; (5) enhancing due diligence
procedures for third-parties; and (6) implementing a new global whistleblower hotline.

12. Throughout the process, Bruker provided extensive, thorough, and real-time
cooperation with the Commission. In addition to self-reporting to the Commission shortly after
discovering the FCPA violations, Bruker voluntarily provided the Commission with real-time
reports of its investigative findings; shared its analysis of important documents and summaries of
witness interviews; expanded the scope of the investigation at the Commissionâs request; and
responded to the Commissionâs requests for documents and information in a timely manner. These
actions assisted the Commission in efficiently collecting valuable evidence, including information
that may not have been otherwise available to the staff.

Legal Standards and Violations

A. Legal Standards

13. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was, or would
be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such violation.

14. The FCPA, enacted in 1977, added Section 13(b)(2)(A) to the Exchange Act to
require reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. 15
U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A).

15. The FCPA also added Section 13(b)(2)(B) to the Exchange Act to require reporting
companies to, among other things, devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that the transactions: (1) are executed in accordance
with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (11) are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles

(âGAAPâ) or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for
assets. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B).

B. Bruker Violated Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act

16. The Bruker China Offices made payments to Chinese government officials that
they improperly recorded on their books and records as legitimate business and marketing
expenses. The books and records of the Bruker China Offices were consolidated into Brukerâs
books and records. As a result of the misconduct of its subsidiaries, Bruker failed to make and
keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected its

5
transactions and the disposition of its assets as required by Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange
Act.

17. The improper payments described above took place over several years and
throughout Brukerâs China operations. Bruker failed to implement an adequate system of internal
controls, including an appropriate FCPA compliance and training program at its Bruker China
Offices, which was commensurate with the risks of doing business in China, and particularly the
risks of businesses that sold products primarily to SOEs. Accordingly, in violation of Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, Bruker failed to devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that it maintained accountability
for its assets, and that its transactions were executed in accordance with managementâs
authorization and recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP.

Commission Consideration of Brukerâs Cooperation and Remedial Efforts

18. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Bruker and the significant cooperation it afforded to the Commission staff.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Brukerâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Bruker cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

B. Respondent shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay $2,399,969 to
the United States Treasury, including $1,714,852 in disgorgement, $310,117 in prejudgment
interest, and a civil monetary penalty of $375,000. If timely payment is not made, additional
interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and 31 U.S.C. Â§ 3717. Payment must be
made in one of the following ways:

(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will
provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through
the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or
(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United States postal
money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-
delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Bruker as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of
the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Paul G. Block, Assistant Director,
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, Boston Regional Office, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 33 Arch Street, Suite 2300, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.

C. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in
excess of $375,000 based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation and related
enforcement action. If at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement
(âDivisionâ) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided materially false
or misleading information or materials to the Commission or in a related proceeding, the Division
may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to
reopen this matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil penalty.
Respondent may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether it
knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1) contest the
findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to,
any statute of limitations defense.

By the Commission.

SEC Charges Massachusetts-Based Scientific Instruments
Manufacturer with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-280

Washington D.C., Dec. 15, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Billerica, Mass.-based global manufacturer of
scientific instruments with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing non-business related travel and improper payments
to various Chinese government officials in an effort to win business.

An SEC investigation found that Bruker Corporation lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect approximately $230,000 in
improper payments out of its China-based offices that falsely recorded them in books and records as legitimate business and marketing
expenses. The payments enabled Bruker to realize approximately $1.7 million in profits from sales contracts with state-owned entities in
China whose officials received the improper payments.

Bruker, which self-reported its misconduct and provided extensive cooperation during the SECâs investigation, agreed to pay approximately
$2.4 million to settle the SECâs charges.

âBrukerâs lax internal controls allowed employees in its China offices to enter into sham âcollaboration agreementsâ to direct money to foreign
officials and send officials on sightseeing trips around the world,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.
âThe company has since taken significant remedial steps to revise its compliance program and enhance internal controls over travel and
contract approvals.â

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, a Bruker office in China paid more than $111,000 to Chinese
government officials under 12 suspicious collaboration agreements contingent on state-owned entities providing research on Bruker products
or using Bruker products in demonstration laboratories. The collaboration agreements did not specify the work product that the state-owned
entities had to provide in order to be paid, and no work product was actually provided to the Bruker office by the state-owned entities.
Certain collaboration agreements were executed directly with a Chinese government official rather than the state-owned entity itself, and in
some cases Brukerâs office paid the official directly.

According to the SECâs order, the other improper payments involved reimbursements to Chinese government officials for leisure travel to the
United States, Czech Republic, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. These officials often were responsible for
authorizing the purchase of Bruker products, and the leisure trips typically followed business-related travel for the officials funded by the
company. For example, Bruker paid for the purported training expenses of a Chinese government official who signed the sales contract on
behalf of a state-owned entity, but the payment actually was reimbursement for sightseeing, tour tickets, shopping, and other leisure
activities in Frankfurt and Paris. Bruker also funded some trips for Chinese government officials that had no legitimate business component.
For example, two Chinese government officials received paid travel to New York despite the lack of any Bruker facilities there, and also to Los
Angeles where they engaged in sightseeing activities.

The SECâs order finds that Bruker violated the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The
company agreed to pay $1,714,852 in disgorgement, $310,117 in prejudgment interest, and a $375,000 penalty. Bruker consented to the
order without admitting or denying the findings, and the SEC considered the companyâs significant remedial acts as well as its self-reporting
and cooperation with the investigation when determining a settlement.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Asita Obeyesekere and Mark Albers of the Boston Regional Office. The case was supervised by
Paul G. Block of the FCPA Unit.

SEC SUES THE TITAN CORPORATION FOR PAYMENTS TO
ELECTION CAMPAIGN OF BENIN PRESIDENT

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2005-23

TITAN SETTLES AND AGREES TO PAY A TOTAL OF MORE THAN $28
MILLION TO SETTLE SEC ACTION AND RELATED CRIMINAL ACTION

Titan Pleads Guilty in Related Criminal Action Brought by U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of California and U.S. Department
of Justice, Fraud Section

SEC Also Issues Report of Investigation to Provide Guidance on
Disclosure Concerning Material Provisions in Merger and Other
Contractual Agreements

Washington, D.C., March 1, 2005 - The SEC today announced the filing of
a settled enforcement action charging The Titan Corporation, a San Diego,
Calif. based military intelligence and communications company, with violating
the anti-bribery, internal controls and books and records provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The SEC's complaint alleges, among
other things, that Titan funneled approximately $2 million, via its agent in
Benin, towards the election campaign of Benin's then-incumbent President.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Titan consented to the
entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the
FCPA and requiring it to

Â® pay approximately $15.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment
interest,

e pay a $13 million penalty, which will be deemed satisfied by Titan's
payment of criminal fines of that amount in parallel proceedings
brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of
California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, and

e retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA
compliance and procedures and to adopt and implement the
consultant's recommendations.

""Illicit payments to government officials are inconsistent with fair play and
vigorous competition and are a violation of U.S. law,"" said Stephen M. Cutler,
Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Capital formation and
corporate enterprise thrive when all parties participate on a level playing
field.""

The SEC also issued a Report of Investigation to provide guidance concerning
potential liability under the antifraud and proxy provisions of the federal
securities laws for publication of materially false or misleading disclosures
regarding provisions in merger and other contractual agreements.

""The SEC's Report of Investigation highlights for issuers and disclosure
counsel the potential exposure under the antifraud and proxy laws for
publishing materially inaccurate disclosures relating to merger and other
contractual agreements,"" said Paul R. Berger, Associate Director of
Enforcement.

Summary of the FCPA Enforcement Action
The SEC's complaint against Titan includes the following allegations.

e From 1999 to 2001, Titan paid more than $3.5 million to its agent in
Benin, Africa, who was known at the time by Titan to be the President of
Benin's business advisor. Some of the approximately $2 million
funneled to its agent towards the election campaign of Benin's then-
incumbent President was used to reimburse Titan's agent for the
purchase of T-shirts adorned with the President's picture and
instructions to vote for him in the upcoming election. Titan made these
payments to assist the company in its development of a
telecommunications project in Benin and to obtain the Benin
government's consent to an increase in the percentage of Titan's
project management fees for that project. A former senior Titan officer
directed that these payments be falsely invoiced by the agent as
consulting services and that actual payment of the money be broken
into smaller increments and spread out over time. The complaint does
not allege that the then-incumbent President knew of the payments.
e In addition, despite utilizing over 120 agents and consultants in over 60
countries, Titan never had a formal company-wide FCPA policy,
disregarded or circumvented the limited FCPA policies and procedures
in effect, failed to maintain sufficient due diligence files on its foreign
agents, and failed to have meaningful oversight over its foreign agents.

e Titan also

Â° falsified documents that enabled Titan's agents to under-report
local commission payments in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka;

e falsified documents presented to the United States government
by under-reporting commission payments on equipment exported
to Sri Lanka, France and Japan;

Â© paid a World Bank Group analyst in cash to assist it in its project
in Benin; and

Â© paid a Benin government official approximately $14,000 in travel
expenses from 1999 to 2001.

Summary of SEC's Report Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange
Act

e On Sept. 15, 2003, Titan became a party to a merger agreement in
which Lockheed Martin Corporation agreed to acquire Titan, pending
certain contingencies. Titan affirmatively represented in that merger
agreement that to the knowledge of Titan, neither the company ""nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has ... taken any action which
would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of
the FCPA."" This representation was publicly disclosed and disseminated
by Titan in two places. The proxy statement disclosed the nature of the
representation. The merger agreement containing the representation
was also appended to Titan's proxy statement.

e As the Report highlights, when an issuer makes a public disclosure of
information -- via filing a proxy statement or otherwise -- the issuer is
required to consider whether additional disclosure is necessary in order
to put the information contained in, or otherwise incorporated into that
publication, into context so that such information is not misleading. The
issuer cannot avoid this disclosure obligation simply because the
information published was contained in an agreement or other
document not prepared as a disclosure document.

e The Report is not intended to change the way issuers engage in merger,
or other contractual, negotiations or to alter existing diligence
obligations or to suggest, absent special circumstances (such as
provisions intended to create third party beneficiaries), that provisions
such as representations and covenants in such agreements are binding
on or intended to benefit persons other than parties thereto.
Representations, covenants, or other provisions of an agreement made
by an issuer that are not public or disclosed to shareholders are not
covered by the scope of this Report.

e The SEC will consider bringing an enforcement action in the future if it
determines that the subject matter of representations or other
contractual provisions is materially misleading to shareholders because
material facts necessary to make that disclosure not misleading are
omitted.

Today the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the
U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section filed criminal FCPA charges and a
tax charge against Titan, who entered a guilty plea before the Honorable
Roger T. Benitez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of
California (United States of America v. Titan Corporation, Case No.05cr0314-
BEN (S.D. Cal.)). In particular, Titan agreed to plead guilty to one felony count
of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one felony count for
falsifying the books and records of Titan, and one felony count for violating
Title 26 U.S.C. Section 7206(2) and to pay a criminal fine of $13 million.

SEC Sanctions Statoil for Bribes to Iranian Government
Official

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2006-174

Washington, D.C., Oct. 13, 2006 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced the institution of a settled enforcement action against
Statoil, ASA, a Norway-based and New York Stock Exchange listed
multinational oil company, for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA), which prohibits bribery of foreign government officials. The
Commission's Order finds that Statoil paid bribes to an Iranian government
official in return for his influence to assist Statoil in obtaining a contract to
develop a significant oil and gas field in Iran and to open doors to additional
projects in the Iranian oil and gas industry.

Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Statoil consented
to entry of an administrative Order that requires Statoil to pay disgorgement
of $10.5 million. The Order also requires Statoil to cease and desist from
committing violations of the antibribery, internal controls and books and
records provisions of the FCPA and to retain an independent compliance
consultant to review and report on Statoil's compliance with the FCPA. Ina
related criminal proceeding announced today, Statoil has agreed to pay a
criminal penalty of $10.5 million pursuant to a deferred prosecution
agreement with the United States Department of Justice and the United States
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Three million of the
$10.5 million penalty is deemed satisfied by a penalty previously paid to the
Norwegian criminal authorities.

""The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it unlawful for public companies to
pay bribes to a foreign government official,"" said Mark K. Schonfeld, Director
of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office. ""The Commission is charged
with enforcing this anti-corruption law against public companies in order to
maintain a level playing field and encourage fair play and competition.""

The Order finds that:

e In June 2002 and January 2003, Statoil paid bribes to an Iranian
government official intending to (i) induce the Iranian Official to use his
influence with the Iranian state-run oil company; (ii) influence the
Iranian state-run oil company's decision about whether to award Statoil
a development contract; and (iii) secure improper advantage for Statoil
by positioning it to obtain future business in Iran, potentially worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

e Statoil agreed to pay the Iranian official through a vaguely defined
consulting contract with an offshore intermediary company organized in
Turks and Caicos and owned by a third party located in London,
England. The consulting contract obligated Statoil to make initial
payments of $200,000 and $5 million, and ten subsequent annual
payments of $1 million each. Statoil made the initial payments of $5.2
million to the Iranian official, but in June 2003, Statoil suspended further
payments.

e In return for the payments, the Iranian official used his influence to
assist Statoil in obtaining business in Iran by, for example, providing
Statoil employees in Iran nonpublic information concerning oil and gas
projects in Iran and showing Statoil copies of bid documents of
competing companies that were otherwise not available to Statoil. In
October 2002, Statoil obtained the contract to develop a significant oil
and gas field.

e During the relevant time period, Statoil employees circumvented
Statoil's internal controls and procedures that were in place to prevent
illegal payments, and Statoil lacked sufficient internal controls. In
addition, by mischaracterizing the payments as legitimate consulting
fees, Statoil violated the books and records provisions of the federal
securities laws.

Statoil cooperated with the Commission's investigation and took a number of
remedial steps as outlined in the Commission's Order.

The Commission appreciates the assistance in this investigation of the United
States Department of Justice, Fraud Division, and the United States Attorney's
Office for the Southern District of New York.

SEC Brings Settled Charges Against Tyco International
Ltd. Alleging Billion Dollar Accounting Fraud

Company Agrees to Injunction and Payment of $50 Million Penalty

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2006-58

Washington, D.C., April 17, 2006 -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against Tyco International
Ltd. The Commission's complaint in that action alleges that, from 1996
through 2002, Tyco violated the federal securities laws by, among other
things, utilizing various improper accounting practices and a scheme involving
transactions with no economic substance to overstate its reported financial
results by at least one billion dollars.

""This enforcement action shows that, in addition to looting the company,
Tyco's Kozlowski-era management lied about the company's financial results,""
said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. ""Tyco
benefited from this fraud, as the penalty in this case reflects.""

Scott W. Friestad, Associate SEC Enforcement Director, stated, ""The Tyco
accounting fraud was orchestrated at the highest levels of the company, but
carried out at numerous operating units and management levels of the
company. 'Push down' frauds like this are especially difficult to detect and
investigate. Today's enforcement action shows that the Commission and its
staff will pursue such misconduct and take appropriate action.""

The Commission's complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income
by at least $500 million as a result of improper accounting practices related to
some of the many acquisitions that Tyco engaged in during that time. Tyco's
improper acquisition accounting included undervaluing acquired assets,
overvaluing acquired liabilities, and misusing accounting rules concerning the
establishment and utilization of purchase accounting reserves. The complaint
further alleges that, apart from its acquisition activities, Tyco improperly
established and used various kinds of reserves to make adjustments at the
end of reporting periods to enhance and smooth its publicly reported results
and to meet earnings forecasts.

The complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by $567 million
from its fiscal year 1998 through its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2002, by
means of connection fees that Tyco's ADT Security Services, Inc. subsidiary
charged to dealers from whom it purchased security monitoring contracts.
Because the connection fee was fully offset by a simultaneous increase in the
purchase price ADT allocated to the dealers' security monitoring contracts,
the connection fee transaction lacked economic substance and should not
have been recorded in Tyco's income statement. In 2003, Tyco restated its
operating income and cash flow relating to the connection fees.

The complaint further alleges that, from September 1996 through early 2002,
Tyco failed to disclose in its proxy statements and annual reports certain
executive compensation, executive indebtedness, and related party
transactions of its former senior management. Tyco also incorrectly
accounted for certain executive bonuses it paid in its fiscal years 2000 and
2001, thereby excluding from its operating expenses the costs associated
with those bonuses. Finally, the complaint alleges that Tyco violated the
antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when employees or
agents of its Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. subsidiary made payments to Brazilian
officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for Tyco.

Between 1996 and 2002, as a result of these various practices, Tyco made
false and misleading statements or omissions in its filings with the
Commission and its public statements to investors and analysts.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint,
Tyco has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it
from violating the antifraud, proxy disclosure, periodic reporting, corporate
recordkeeping, and antibribery provisions of the federal securities laws. The
proposed final judgment also orders Tyco to pay $1 in disgorgement and a
$50 million civil penalty. The penalty amount, which was provisionally
negotiated in 2005, was reviewed and approved by the Commission in light of
the considerations set forth in ""Statement of the Securities and Exchange
Commission Concerning Financial Penalties,"" Press Release 2006-4 (Jan. 4,
2006).

SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal
Controls Charges Against El Paso Corporation for
Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food
Program

Company Agrees to Pay $7.7 Million

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007-16

Washington, D.C., Feb. 7, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal
controls charges against El Paso Corporation, alleging that the NYSE-listed
Texas energy company indirectly paid nearly $5.5 million in illegal surcharges
to Iraq in connection with its purchases of crude oil from third parties under
the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Between June 2001 and June 2002,
El Paso purchased some 21.4 million barrels of Iraqi crude oil under fifteen
contracts from third parties who participated in the Program. The
Commissionâs complaint alleges that 25 to 30 cents per barrel purchased by
El Paso was illegally kicked back to Iraq in the form of a secret oil surcharge
and that El Paso knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that illegal surcharges
were made.

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Division of Enforcement, said, âThe
Oil for Food kickback scheme in which El Paso participated is especially
troubling because it systematically diverted millions of dollars from a
humanitarian program intended to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people,
and violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

Cheryl Scarboro, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, said,
âThe books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act are important tools to combat illicit kickback schemes. Todayâs
action should emphasize that these activities will not be tolerated.â

Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, El Paso has
consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and ordering it to pay $5,482,363 in disgorgement of profits and
a civil penalty of $2,250,000. El Paso will satisfy its disgorgement obligation
by forfeiting $5,482,363 pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement with the
U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York.

According to the Commissionâs complaint:

The Oil for Food Program was created to provide humanitarian relief for the
Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade
sanctions imposed against Iraq. However, beginning in August 2000, officials
of Iraqâs State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO), began demanding illegal
kickbacks in the form of surcharges on every barrel of oil sold through the
Program. In September 2000, The Coastal Corporation - which merged with
an El Paso subsidiary in January 2001 - received its first surcharge demand
from a SOMO official. An El Paso consultant and former Coastal official
arranged a $201,877 surcharge payment on the companyâs behalf.

Although El Paso ceased direct purchases from SOMO afterwards, it continued
its purchases through third parties. Between June 2001 and June 2002, El
Paso entered into fourteen third party transactions involving fifteen contracts
to purchase Iraqi oil. The third parties paid some $5.5 million in kickbacks to
acquire the oil. El Paso knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that illegal
surcharges were paid on those contracts and passed back to El Paso in
premiums. Recorded telephone calls of El Paso officials and oil traders
establish El Pasoâs knowledge of the illegal surcharge scheme. El Paso failed
to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent
such payments, and El Paso failed properly to record the nature of the
companyâs payments.

Since being approached by the Commissionâs staff, El Paso has cooperated
with the Commissionâs investigation, which is continuing. The Commission

acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneyâs Office for the
Southern District of New York and the United Nations Independent Inquiry

Committee.

Chevron to Pay $30 Million to Settle Charges For
Improper Payments to Iraq Under U.N. Oil For Food
Program

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007-230

Washington, D.C., Nov. 14, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged Chevron Corporation for its role in illegal kickback payments
that were made to Iraq in 2001 and 2002 in connection with the company's
purchases of crude oil under the U.N. Oil for Food Program.

Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., agreed to pay $30 million to settle the
charges brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) without
admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.

The U.N. Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief to
the Iraqi people while Iraq was subject to international trade sanctions.
According to the Commission's complaint, third parties under contract with
Chevron made approximately $20 million in illicit payments that bypassed the
Oil for Food escrow account and were paid directly to Iraqi-controlled bank
accounts in Jordan and Lebanon. The SEC alleged that Chevron knew, or
should have known, that third parties were using portions of the premiums
they received from Chevron's oil purchases to pay illegal surcharges to Iraq.
The SEC also alleged that Chevron failed to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls to detect and prevent such illicit payments, and
Chevron's accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed to properly record
the true nature of the company's payments to third parties.

""This is the Commission's fifth action against a company for participating in
the Oil for Food kickback scheme and demonstrates our continuing
commitment to combating violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,""
said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.

Cheryl Scarboro, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, added,
""The Commission will continue to vigorously enforce the books and records
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to combat
illicit kickbacks.""

According to the Commission's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York, Chevron learned of surcharge demands by
Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) in January 2001 and adopted a
company-wide policy prohibiting their payment. The policy required traders to
obtain prior written approval for all proposed Iraqi oil purchases and charged
management with reviewing each proposed Iraqi oil deal.

Chevron subsequently purchased approximately 78 million barrels of crude oil
from Iraq pursuant to 36 contracts with third parties from April 17, 2001,
through May 6, 2002. In doing so, the Commission alleges, Chevron's traders
failed to follow the company-wide policy and Chevron's management did not
ensure compliance. Despite being required to consider the identity,
experience and reputation of a third-party seller prior to approving a proposed
Iraqi oil purchase, Chevron's management relied on its traders'
representations.

In one instance, a credit check by Chevron of a proposed third-party seller
revealed that the seller was a ""brass plate company."" This meant that the
company had no experience in the oil business, no real business operations,
and no known assets. Despite concerns on the part of Chevron's
management, Chevron entered into two transactions to purchase three
million barrels of oil from the third party in January 2002. Illegal surcharges
were paid on both of these transactions and passed back to Chevron in
inflated premiums that Chevron paid to the third party.

Also according to the SEC's complaint, a third-party seller whose company
occasionally sold oil to Chevron stated that the trader he dealt with at
Chevron and the trader's bosses always knew about the illegal surcharge
demands by Iraq. The Chevron trader asked the third-party seller to persuade
Iraq to reduce the amount of its surcharges. Despite Chevron's premium
payments to third parties increasing after Iraq's surcharge demands began,
Chevron's management routinely approved the Iraqi oil purchases proposed
by its traders.

Chevron consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it
from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering it to disgorge $25 million in profits and
pay a $3 million civil penalty. Chevron also will pay the Office of Foreign Asset
Controls of the U.S. Department of Treasury a penalty of $2 million. Chevron
will satisfy its disgorgement obligation by forfeiting $20 million pursuant to an
agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New
York and paying disgorgement of $5 million pursuant to an agreement with
the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for
the Southern District of New York, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office,
the Office of Foreign Asset Controls at the U.S. Department of Treasury, and
the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee. The Commission also
acknowledges Chevron's cooperation in the investigation. The SEC's Oil for
Food investigation is continuing.

SEC Charges Former Chairman/CEO of Schnitzer Steel
for Authorizing Cash Bribes to Foreign Officials

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007-262

Washington, D.C., Dec. 13, 2007 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged the former Chairman and CEO of Schnitzer Steel Industries,
Inc., with violating anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) by approving cash payments and other gifts to officials at Chinese
government-owned steel mills to entice their business.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, Robert W. Philip of Portland,
Ore., agreed to pay more than $250,000 to settle the SECâs charges.

âThis case demonstrates the Commissionâs commitment to holding individuals
accountable when they engage in illegal conduct to obtain business in foreign
countries,â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of
Enforcement.

The Commissionâs complaint, filed in U.S. district court in Portland, Ore.,
alleges that from at least 1999 through 2004, Philip authorized payment of
more than $200,000 in cash bribes and other gifts to managers at
government-owned steel mills in China to induce them to purchase scrap
metal from Portland-based Schnitzer. The Commission alleges that Schnitzer
generated more than $96 million in revenue and more than $6.2 million in
profits from sales to customers who had received the improper payments. The
complaint further alleges that Philip authorized more than $1.7 million in
payments to managers of privately owned steel mills in both China and South
Korea, generating more than $500 million in additional revenue for the
company.

The SECâs complaint alleges that Philip violated the anti-bribery,
recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. Philip agreed to
disgorge $169,863.79 in bonuses and pay $16,536.63 in prejudgment interest
and a $75,000 civil penalty, and agreed to an order enjoining him from future
violations of the FCPA.

In October 2006, Schnitzer paid $7.7 million in disgorgement to settle related
charges by the Commission, and paid $7.5 million in penalties to settle
related criminal charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in
its investigation.

SEC Charges Baker Hughes With Foreign Bribery and
With Violating 2001 Commission Cease-and-Desist Order

Baker Hughes Subsidiary Pleads Guilty to Three Felony Charges in
Criminal Action Filed by Department of Justice; Criminal Fines, Civil
Penalties and Disgorgement of Illicit Profits Total More Than $44
Million

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007-77

Washington, D.C., April 26, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced the filing of a settled enforcement action charging Baker
Hughes Incorporated, a Houston, Texas-based global provider of oil field
products and services, with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA). Baker Hughes has agreed to pay more than $23 million in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest for these violations and to pay a civil
penalty of $10 million for violating a 2001 Commission cease-and-desist Order
prohibiting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions
of the FCPA.

In the same complaint, the SEC also charged Roy Fearnley, a former business
development manager for Baker Hughes, with violating and aiding and
abetting violations of the FCPA. Fearnley has not reached any settlement with
the Commission regarding these charges.

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said,
""Baker Hughes committed widespread and egregious violations of the FCPA
while subject to a prior Commission cease-and-desist Order. The $10 million
penalty demonstrates that companies must adhere to Commission Orders and
that recidivists will be punished.""

Christopher R. Conte, an Associate Director in the SEC's Division of
Enforcement, added, ""Companies like Baker Hughes will be held accountable
when they circumvent the rules of fair play and honest competition by making
improper payments to win business.""

The SEC's complaint alleges that Baker Hughes paid approximately $5.2
million to two agents while knowing that some or all of the money was
intended to bribe government officials, specifically officials of State-owned
companies, in Kazakhstan. The complaint alleges that one agent was hired in
September 2000 on the understanding that Kazakhoil, Kazakhstan's national
oil company at that time, had demanded that the agent be hired to influence
senior level employees of Kazakhoil to approve the award of business to the
company. Baker Hughes retained the agent principally at the urging of
Fearnley. According to the complaint, Fearnley told his bosses that the ""agent
for Kazakhoil"" told him that unless the agent was retained, Baker Hughes
could ""say goodbye to this and future business."" Baker Hughes engaged the
agent and was awarded an oil services contract in the Karachaganak oil field
in Kazakhstan that generated more than $219 million in gross revenues from
2001 through 2006. Baker Hughes, the complaint alleges, paid the agent $4.1
million to its bank account in London but received no identifiable services
from the agent. The complaint also alleges that in 1998 Baker Hughes
retained a second agent in connection with the award of a large chemical
contract with KazTransOil, the national oil transportation operator of
Kazakhstan. Between 1998 and 1999, Baker Hughes paid over $1 million to
the agent's Swiss bank account, despite a company employee knowing by
December 1998 that the agent's representative was a high-ranking executive
of KazTransOil.

The SEC's complaint against Baker Hughes also alleges violations of the books
and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in Nigeria, Angola,
Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In addition to violating the
FCPA, certain of this conduct occurred after September 12, 2001, and
consequently violated the Commission's 2001 cease-and-desist Order.
Specifically, the complaint alleges that between 1998 and 2005, Baker
Hughes made payments in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan in circumstances that reflected a failure to implement sufficient
internal controls to determine whether the payments were for legitimate
services, whether the payments would be shared with government officials, or
whether these payments would be accurately recorded in Baker Hughes'
books and records.

For example, the complaint alleges that

e from 1998 to 2004, Baker Hughes authorized commission payments of
nearly $5.3 million to an agent (who worked in Kazakhstan, Russia and
Uzbekistan) under circumstances in which the company failed to
determine whether such payments were, in part, to be funneled to
government officials in violation of the FCPA;

e in Indonesia, between 2000 and 2003, Baker Hughes paid certain
freight forwarders to import equipment into Indonesia using a ""door-to-
door"" process under circumstances in which the company failed to
adequately assure itself that such payments were not being passed on,
in part, to Indonesian customs officials;

e in Nigeria, between at least 2001 and 2005, Baker Hughes authorized
payments to certain customs brokers to facilitate the resolution of
alleged customs deficiencies under circumstances in which the
company failed to adequately assure itself that such payments were not
being passed on, in part, to Nigerian customs officials; and

e in Angola, from 1998 to 2003, Baker Hughes paid an agent more than
$10.3 million in commissions under circumstances in which the
company failed to adequately assure itself that such payments were not
being passed on to employees of Sonangol, Angola's state-owned oil
company, to obtain or retain business in Angola.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Baker Hughes consented
to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations
of the FCPA and ordering it to pay a civil penalty and disgorgement with
prejudgment interest; and to retain an independent consultant to review the
company's FCPA policies and procedures.

The Commission acknowledges Baker Hughes' cooperation in the
investigation.

In a related criminal proceeding announced today, the United States
Department of Justice filed criminal FCPA charges against Baker Hughes and
its wholly-owned subsidiary Baker Hughes Services International, Inc., with an
office in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. Baker Hughes Services International, Inc.
entered a guilty plea before the Honorable Gray H. Miller, United States
District Judge for the Southern District of Texas, and agreed to plead guilty to
one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one count of
aiding and abetting the falsification of the books and records of Baker
Hughes, and one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and to pay a
criminal fine of $11 million. The Department of Justice has also entered into
an agreement with Baker Hughes to defer prosecution for two years on
charges of violating the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the
FCPA. Under the agreement, the company will retain for a period of three
years a monitor to review and assess the company's compliance program and
monitor its implementation of and compliance with new internal policies and
procedures.

The staff acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the U.S.
Department of Justice, Fraud Section. The staff also acknowledges the help
provided, in the form of mutual legal assistance, by the Isle of Man Financial
Supervision Commission, HM Procureur (Attorney General) for Guernsey, and
by the authorities of the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

Plaintiff, Â§

Â§ Civil Action No.: 08-2680
VS. Â§

Â§ COMPLAINT

ALBERT JACKSON STANLEY, Â§
Â§
Defendant. Â§
Â§

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ) alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (the âFCPAââ) of the federal securities laws by Defendant Albert Jackson
Stanley âStanleyâ or âDefendantâ). During the relevant period, Stanley was an
executive of Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc. (âKBRâ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Halliburton Company, and KBRâs predecessor, The M.W. Kellogg Company
(âKelloggââ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dresser Industries, Inc.

2. Between at least 1995 and 2004, Stanley, along with others, devised and
implemented a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining
multiple contracts worth over $6 billion to build liquefied natural gas production facilities
(âLNG Trainsâ) in Bonny Island, Nigeria. The contracts were awarded to a four-
company joint venture of which Kellogg, and later KBR, was a member. To conceal the

illicit payments, Stanley and others approved sham âconsultingâ or âservicesâ agreements
Case 4:08-cv-02680 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 09/03/2008 Page 2 of 10

with intermediaries who would then funnel their purportedly legitimate fees to Nigerian
officials. Specifically, Stanley and others implemented this scheme by using a Gibraltar
shell company controlled by a solicitor based in the United Kingdom (âthe UK Agentâ)

and a Japanese company (âthe Japanese Agentâ) as conduits for the bribes.

3. The Commission brings this action against the Defendant seeking
permanent injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the federal securities laws.

JURISDICTION

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),
21(e) and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C.
SÂ§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa].

5. Stanley, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails and of the means
and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the acts, practices and
courses of business described in this Complaint.

DEFENDANT

6. Stanley, age 65, is a United States citizen who resides in Houston, Texas,
and a former employee of Dresser Industries, Inc. (âDresserââ) and Halliburton Company
(âHalliburtonâ). Prior to September 1998, Stanley was the head of Dresserâs wholly-
owned construction subsidiary, Kellogg, and a senior vice-president of Dresser. In
September 1998, Dresser merged into Halliburton; Halliburton was the surviving entity.
Halliburton combined Kellogg with its construction subsidiary, Brown & Root, Inc., to
form KBR. After the merger and formation of KBR, Stanley was the CEO of KBR until
2001. He then served as chairman of KBR. He continued to work for the company until

June 2004.

RELATED ENTITIES

7. Halliburton is a Delaware energy services corporation, headquartered in
Houston, Texas and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Its common stock is registered under
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the NYSE. It merged with Dresser in
September 1998, and became the surviving entity. Prior to the merger, Dresserâs
common stock was registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.

8. KBR is a Delaware engineering, construction and government services
corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas. KBR was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Halliburton until November 2006, when KBR became a separate publicly-traded
company. KBRâs common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and trades on the NYSE.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

Stanley and Others Agree to Pay
Bribes to Obtain Nigeria LNG Contract

9. The Nigerian government created Nigeria LNG, Ltd. (âNigeria LNGââ) in
the late 1980s to develop the production of natural gas associated with oil production in
Nigeria. At all relevant times, the Nigerian government owned 49% of the company and
exercised control over the company.

10. In June 1990, in order to pursue certain LNG projects in Nigeria,

Dresser subsidiary Kellogg formed a joint venture with three other multi-national
companies. The joint venture began to pursue bidding on a construction contract to build
two LNG Trains in Bonny Island, Nigeria. After Halliburton merged with Dresser and

formed KBR, KBR replaced Kellogg in the joint venture.
Case 4:08-cv-02680 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 09/03/2008 Page 4 of 10

11. Stanley was intimately involved in the joint venture and its business in
Nigeria from the joint ventureâs inception. Each member of the joint venture had one or
more representatives on a steering committee that ran the joint venture. Stanley was a
senior member of that steering committee at all relevant times.

12. Beginning at least as early as 1994, Stanley and other members of the joint
venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to individuals within the Nigerian
government to assist in obtaining the LNG contract. To implement and hide this scheme,
they discussed: 1) using sham consulting contracts with various individuals or shell
corporations (agents); and 11) âdownloadingâ the payments through subcontractors or
vendors. Ostensibly, the agents or vendors would be retained and paid to perform
legitimate services. In actuality, the agents or vendors would use the money in whole or
in part to make corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials on behalf of the joint
venture.

13. Eventually the joint venture decided to funnel the payments through two
entities, using the UK Agent to pay high-ranking Nigerian officials, and using the
Japanese Agent to pay lower-level Nigerian officials. Payments made to the UK Agent,
as Well as payments by the UK Agent to Nigerian government officials, were routed
through banks in New York.

The UK Agent

Trains One and Two

 

14. Before entering into a contract with the UK Agent, Stanley wanted
assurance from high-ranking Nigerian government officials that the UK Agent was the

right conduit. Therefore, the UK Agent arranged for Stanley and others in the joint
Case 4:08-cv-02680 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 09/03/2008 Page 5of 10

venture to meet with senior Nigerian government officials in late November 1994. At the
meeting, a high-ranking Nigerian official confirmed that the UK Agent should serve as
the conduit for payments. After that meeting, Stanley approved the joint venture entering
into an agreement to pay the UK Agent $60 million, with the understanding that a
substantial portion of this money would be funneled to Nigerian officials as bribes.

15. In December 1994, Nigeria LNG selected the joint venture as its
âpreferred contractorâ by entering into a Memorandum of Understanding, a significant
first step towards awarding the contract for the first two LNG Trains.

16. In December 1995, Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture the contract to
build the first two LNG Trains, for $2.2 billion. The joint venture began construction in
1996 and finished in 2000. As the joint venture received payments for the construction
from Nigeria LNG, it paid the UK Agent. The joint venture sent a total of $60 million to
the UK Agentâs Swiss bank account between December 1995 and March 2000 for the
purpose of making corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials.

17. As the UK Agent received these payments, the UK Agent made systematic
and substantial transfers of money to accounts owned or controlled by one or more high-
ranking Nigerian government officials.

Train Three

18. In 1996, the joint venture began pursuing a contract with Nigeria LNG to
build Train Three in Bonny Island, Nigeria. In May 1997, Stanley and others in the joint
venture traveled to Nigeria to meet with high-ranking Nigerian government officials to

confirm that the UK Agent was still the correct intermediary to use to pay bribes.
Case 4:08-cv-02680 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 09/03/2008 Page 6 of 10

19. In February 1999, Stanley and others in the joint venture again traveled to
Nigeria to meet a high-ranking Nigerian government official who confirmed that the UK
Agent was the correct intermediary. The Nigerian official also appointed his own
representative to negotiate the bribe amount. In March 1999, Stanley and others at KBR
and the joint venture met with the officialâs representative in London to negotiate the
amount of the bribes to be paid in connection with the award of the Train Three LNG
contract. Stanley and others agreed to pay $32.5 million.

20. Days after the London meeting, Nigeria LNG awarded the Train Three
contract to the joint venture for $1.2 billion. The joint venture then entered into a new
agreement with the UK Agent for the $32.5 million negotiated at the London meeting.
Between March 1999 and May 2003, the joint venture paid the UK Agent, directing the
payments to the UK Agentâs bank accounts in Switzerland and Monaco. After receiving
the money, the UK Agent made substantial payments to one or more Nigerian
government officials.

Trains Four Through Six

 

21. In approximately 2001, the joint venture discussed bidding on the next
series of LNG Trains. In November 2001, Stanley and others in the joint venture again
traveled to Nigeria to meet a high-ranking government official, who confirmed that the
UK Agent was still acceptable to serve as a conduit for the payments and who appointed
his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount.

22. In December 2001, the joint venture entered into another agreement with
the UK Agent in connection with Trains Four and Five for $51 million. In March 2002,

Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture a $1.6 billion contract to build Trains Four and
Case 4:08-cv-02680 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 09/03/2008 Page 7 of 10

Five. Between March 2002 and January 2004, the joint venture paid the UK Agent
$40 million under the sham consulting agreement. After receiving the payments, the UK
Agent made substantial transfers of money to one or more Nigerian government officials.

23. In June 2002, the joint venture entered into another contract with the UK
Agent for Train Six for $23 million. Stanley and others authorized and directed the joint
venture to enter into the contract to use the agent as a conduit to bribe, and offer to bribe,
Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining the contract to build Train Six. In
July 2004, Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture a $970 million contract to build Train
Six.

The Japanese Agent

24. As alleged above, Stanley and others in the joint venture agreed to use the
Japanese Agent to make corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian government officials
in connection with the Bonny Island LNG Trains.

25. Between 1996 and 2002, the joint venture entered into three âservicesâ
agreements with the Japanese Agent. Stanley and others authorized and directed the joint
venture to enter into each of the agreements with the Japanese Agent intending and
expecting that the Japanese Agent would use money it received under these agreements
to offer and make corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian officials to assist in obtaining
the LNG contracts to build Trains One through Five.

26. Between 1996 and June 2004, when the payments ended, the joint venture

paid the Japanese Agent more than $50 million.

Falsification of Company Records and Circumvention of Internal Controls

27. In numerous Dresser, Halliburton and KBR company records, Stanley and
others falsely characterized the payments to the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent as
legitimate âconsultingâ or âservicesâ fees when, in fact, Stanley knew they were bribes.
For example, Stanley authorized entering into contracts with the UK Agent and the
Japanese Agent that he knew falsely described the purpose of the contracts in order to
make it appear that the agents would perform legitimate services. Stanley and others also
prepared for approval internal company bid documents for the LNG Trains that
mischaracterized the bribe payments as legitimate expenses. In addition, certain records
falsified by Stanley were used in the companiesâ due diligence process for approving use
of the UK Agent.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

Violations of Section 30A of the Exchange Act
(Anti-bribery Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)

28. Paragraphs | through 27 are realleged and incorporated herein by
reference.

29. As described above, Defendant, an officer, director, employee or agent of
a U.S. issuer, acting on its behalf, made use of the mails or any means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or
authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or
authorization of the giving of anything of value, to foreign officials for the purposes of
influencing their acts or decisions, securing an improper advantage, or inducing them to

use their influence, to assist the issuer in obtaining or retaining business.
Case 4:08-cv-02680 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 09/03/2008 Page 9 of 10

30. In addition, Defendant at all relevant times was a U.S. person as that term
is defined in Section 30A(g)(2) of the Exchange Act, and was an officer, director,
employee or agent of a U.S. issuer acting on its behalf. Defendant corruptly committed
acts outside the United States in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or
authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or
authorization of the giving of anything of value, to foreign officials for the purposes of
influencing their acts or decisions, securing an improper advantage, or inducing them to
use their influence, to assist the issuer in obtaining or retaining business.

31. By reason of the foregoing, Defendant violated, and unless restrained and
enjoined will continue to violate, Section 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

Violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1
(Company Records and Internal Controls)

32. Paragraphs | through 31 above are realleged and incorporated by
reference herein.

33. As described above, during the relevant period Defendant knowingly
falsified, and directly or indirectly, caused to be falsified books, records, or accounts of a
U.S. issuer subject to Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)]. As
a result of Defendantâs conduct, the books and records of a U.S. issuer falsely reflected
the payments to the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent as legitimate business expenses
instead of bribes. By falsifying documents and authorizing the sham agent contracts,
Defendant also knowingly circumvented certain internal accounting controls of a U.S.

issuer.

SEC Charges Former CEO of Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc.
with Foreign Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2008-189

Washington, D.C., Sept. 3, 2008 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged former Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc. (KBR) executive Albert
Jackson Stanley with violating the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and related provisions of the federal securities
laws. The Commission alleges that over a 10-year period, Stanley and others
participated in a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials in order to
obtain construction contracts worth more than $6 billion. The contracts were
awarded to a four-company joint venture of which The M.W. Kellogg
Company, and later KBR, was a member.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 20700
Â» SEC Complaint

 

âAs this case demonstrates, the SEC is committed to holding violators
accountable when they engage in illegal conduct to obtain business in foreign
countries,â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of
Enforcement.

The SEC alleges that beginning as early as 1994, Stanley and other members
of the joint venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to
individuals within the Nigerian government in order to obtain contracts to
build liquefied natural gas facilities (LNG Trains) in Bonny Island, Nigeria.
Stanley and others met with high-ranking Nigerian government officials and
their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe
payments. To conceal the illicit payments, Stanley and others approved
entering into sham contracts with two âagentsâ to funnel money to the
Nigerian officials. Thereafter, as the joint venture was paid for its work
building the LNG Trains, the joint venture paid the agents more than $180
million. In turn, substantial payments were made to various Nigerian
government officials.

âThis case demonstrates the Commissionâs continued vigorous enforcement
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Antonia Chion, an Associate
Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThe FCPA prohibits both direct
bribes and those that are made through intermediaries.â

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Stanley has
consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from
violating the anti-bribery, record-keeping and internal control provisions of
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1).
Stanley also has agreed to cooperate with the SECâs ongoing investigation.
The proposed settlement with Stanley is subject to the courtâs approval.

In a related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed criminal charges against Stanley for conspiring to violate the
FCPA and conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud. Stanley has pleaded
guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of
conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud (unrelated to the FCPA charge). He
faces seven years in prison and payment of $10.8 million in restitution.

âThe Department of Justice is committed to aggressively enforcing the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General
Matthew Friedrich. âTodayâs plea demonstrates that corporate executives who
bribe foreign government officials in return for lucrative business deals can
expect to face prosecution.â

The Commissionâs investigation is continuing. The Commission acknowledges
the assistance of the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section
as well as foreign authorities in the Commission's investigation.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ), alleges:
SUMMARY
1. Between March 12, 2001 and September 30, 2007 (the âRelevant

Periodâ), Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (âSiemensâ or the âCompanyââ) violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] (the âFCPAâ) by engaging in a
widespread and systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government officials to â
obtain business. Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of its
corrupt payments, and the Companyâs inadequate internal controls allowed the illicit
conduct to flourish. The misconduct involved employees at all levels of the Company,

including former senior management, and reveals a corporate culture that had long been

at odds with the FCPA.
2. During this period, Siemens made thousands of separate payments to third
parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the money.
At least 4,283 of those payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, were used to bribe
government officials in return for business to Siemens around the world. Among the
transactions on which Siemens paid bribes were those to design and build metro transit
lines in Venezuela; metro trains and signaling devices in China; power plants in Israel;
high voltage transmission lines in China; mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh;
telecommunications projects in Nigeria; national identity cards in Argentina; medical
devices in Vietnam, China, and Russia; traffic control systems in Russia; refineries in
Mexico; and mobile communications networks in Vietnam. Siemens also paid kickbacks
to iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under
the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned over $1.1 billion in profits on
these fourteen categories of transactions that comprised 332 individual projects or
individual sales.

3. In November 2006, Siemensâ current management began to implement
reforms to the Companyâs internal controls. These reforms substantially reduced, but did
not entirely eliminate, corrupt payments. All but $27.5 million of the corrupt payments
occurred prior to November 15, 2006.

4. Siemens violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] by making illicit payments to foreign
government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Siemens violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have an adequate internal control system in .

_place to detect and prevent the illicit payments. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
_ the Exchange Act by improperly recording each of those payments in its accounting
books and records.
JURISDICTION

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),
' and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. Siemens, directly or
indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the
mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the â
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

6. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391).

| DEFENDANT

7. Siemens is a German corporation with its executive offices in Munich,
Federal Republic of Germany. Siemens is one of the worldâs largest manufacturers of
industrial and consumer products. Siemens builds locomotives, traffic control systems
and electrical power plants. The Company also manufactures building control systems,
medical equipment and electrical components, and formerly manufactured
communications networks. Siemens employs approximately 428,200 people and
operates in approximately 190 countries worldwide. Siemens reported net revenue of
$116.5 billion and net income of $8.9 billion for its fiscal year ended September 30,
2008.

8. | In accordance with German law, Siemens has a Supervisory Board and a
Managing Board. The Supervisory Board is generally comparable to the board of

directors of a corporation in the United States in that it oversees management but with
. less oversight power under German law. The Managing Board -- or âVorstandâ ~
generally performs the duties and responsibilities of senior management of a corporation
in the United States and includes the Companyâs Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) and
Chief Financial Officer (âCFOâ).

9. Prior to a recent reorganization, Siemens operated through a complex
array of business groups and regional companies. The business groups are divisions
within Siemens and are not separate legal entities. The regional companies are wholly-
or partly-owned subsidiaries of Siemens. The thirteen principal business groups during
the Relevant Period were: Communications (âCOMâ), Siemens Business Services
(âSBSâ), Automation and Drives (âA&Dâ), Industrial Solutions and Services (âT&Sâ),
Siemens Building Technologies (âSBTâ), Power Generation (âPGâ), Power Transmission
and Distribution (âPTDâ), Transportation Systems (âTSâ), Siemens VDO Automotive
(âSVâ), Medical Solutions (âMEDâ), Osram Middle East, Siemens Financial Services
(âSFSâ), and Siemens Real Estate (âSREâ). In 2008, Siemens reorganized the groups
into three Sectors â Energy, Healthcare and Industry.

10. Since March 12, 2001, Siemensâ American Depository Shares have been
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. {15
U.S.C. Â§ 781(b)]. Siemensâ American Depository Shares trade on the New York Stock
Exchange (âNYSEâ) under the symbol âSI.â

| FACTS
A. Background
11. Siemens traces its origins to 1847 and for over 160 years has been one of

the most successful conglomerate companies in Germany. After World War II, Siemens
had difficulty competing for business in many Western countries and responded by
seeking business opportunities in certain less developed countries where corrupt business
practices were common.

12. - During the pre-1999 period, the first period, bribery at Siemens was
largely unregulated. German law did not prohibit foreign bribery and allowed tax
deductions for bribes paid in foreign countries. Siemens was not yet listed on the NYSE
and therefore was not subject to U.S. regulation. Undeterred by foreign laws that |
prohibited bribery, Siemens put several payment mechanisms in place, including the use .
of cash and off-books accounts, to make payments as necessary to win business.

13. The term Niitzliche Aufwendungen (âNAâ) or âuseful expendituresâ was a |
commonly used tax law term and was commonly listed on Siemens? cost calculation
sheets to denote payments to third parties, including illicit payments to foreign officials.
Though as-a rule Siemens required two signatures on all major documents in accordance
with an internal control known as the âfour-eyesâ principle, many exceptions to the rule
were made to ensure quick access to cash to make illicit payments.

14. Over time, Siemens developed a ânetwork of payment mechanisms
designed to funnel money through third parties in a way that obscured the purpose and
ultimate recipient of the funds. On at least one project, bribes to high ranking
government officials were arranged personally by a member of the Vorstand. The
success of Siemensâ bribery system was maintained by lax internal controls over
corruption related activities and an acceptance of such activities by members of senior

management and the compliance, internal audit, legal and finance departments.
1. NYSE Listing

15. From 1999 to 2003, the second period, the Vorstand was ineffective in
implementing controls to address constraints imposed by Germanyâs 1999 adoption of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (âOECDâ) anti-bribery
convention that outlawed foreign bribery.-On February 15, 1999, the very day that
Germany ratified the OECD Convention, the then-CEO of Siemens âexpressed his
concern at the number of criminal and other investigations into members of the
Company,â further noting that â[a]s the Board could possibly be held responsible for
various offenses, it was important to take protective measures.â However, bribery
continued for years afterward.

16. The Vorstand was also ineffective in meeting the U.S. regulatory and anti-
bribery requirements that Siemens was subject to following its March 12, 2001, listing on
the NYSE.

17. The changes in the legal landscape caused by Germanyâs ratification of
the OECD Convention and Siemensâ listing on the NYSE should have put an end to
bribery at Siemens. Unfortunately, they did not. Instead, a steady flow of improper
payments continued to emanate from the Company, in large part because of certain
actions and inactions taken by the Vorstand.

| 18. For instance in mid-2000, as Siemens prepared for its NYSE listing, its
legal department forwarded a memorandum to the Supervisory Board Chairman and CFO
- identifying certain off-books accounts, The memorandum made it clear that Siemensâ

accounts had to be maintained âqn harmony with the principles of orderly accounting.
Otherwise sanctions are likely under criminal law.â The Vorstand failed to act, and the
off-books accounts continued to exist even after Siemensâ NYSE listing.

19. In addition, the Vorstand failed to adopt meaningful compliance measures,
failed to adequately-staff Siemensâ compliance function and, at times, failed to adopt
reasonable recommendations designed to enhance compliance procedures at the
Company. As illustrated herein, many of the improper payments made by Siemens
involved the use of business consultants and business consulting agreements to funnel
illicit payments to third parties, including government officials. In April 2000, the
Vorstand rejected a proposal by the Companyâs General Counsel to create a Company-
wide list of business consultants and a committee to review these relationships. Although
Siemens issued various principles and recommendations regarding business consultants,
Siemens had no mandatory and comprehensive Company-wide rules in place governing
the use of business consultanits until June of 2005.

2. Red Flags (Communications Group â Nigeria)

20. From 2003 to 2006, the third period, members of the Vorstand failed to
respond appropriately to indications that bribery was widespread at Siemens. Red flags
that the Vorstand members missed or ignored included substantial cash payments in
Nigeria by senior level employees within the COM business group. In the fall of 2003,
Siemensâ outside auditor KPMG identified â¬4.12 million in cash that was brought to
Nigeria by COM employees and flagged the payments for review. A compliance
attorney at the Company conducted a one-day investigation of the payments and wrote a
report indicating that COM employees admitted that it was not an isolated event and ,

warned of numerous possible violations of law. Though the compliance report was
reviewed in November 2003 by Siemensâ then-CFO, no disciplinary action was taken, no
further investigative work was conducted, and the report was not provided to or discussed
with the Vorstand as a whole or the Companyâs audit committee. COM employees
identified in the report, including a former COM manager, continued to pay bribes
through a series of slush funds until at least November 2006, when they were arrested
following a raid of Siemensâ offices (the âDawn Raidâ) by criminal authorities in
Munich, Germany. Had senior management responded differently, bribes paid by the
COM group could have been reduced or eliminated.

3. Red Flags (Power Generation Group - Italy)

21. During the third period, the Vorstand also failed to respond appropriately
""to multi-million dollar bribes paid in Italy by managers of the Siemens PG business
group. In July 2003, the news media reported that prosecutors in Milan were
investigating bribes paid to employees of ENEL, an energy company partly-owned by the
Italian government, in connection with two power plant projects. Siemens PG managers
made approximately â¬6 million in corrupt payments to two ENEL officials. The corrupt
payments were routed through slush funds in Liechtenstein using a Dubai-based business
consultant.

| 22. âIn April 2004, a judge in Milan issued a written opinion concluding that

the evidence indicated that Siemens viewed bribery âat least as a possible business
strategy.â In or around May 2004, a legal memorandum concerning the ruling was sent
to members of the Vorstand, including the then-CEO and then-CFO of the Company.
Another memorandum, sent to members of the Vorstand, including the then-CEO and the

then-CFO in April 2004, detailed severance packages that had been given to the PG
managers and attached a September 2003 memorandum prepared by an American law
firm. The legal memorandum suggested that Siemens should immediately review and
assure proper functioning of its FCPA compliance program, that the allegations and steps
taken to address them should be reported to the board, and that the employees involved
should be disciplined.

23. Subsequently, Siemens, along with two of its PG managers, entered into a
plea bargain with criminal authorities in Italy pursuant to which Siemens paid a â¬0.5
million fine, gave up â¬6.2 million in profits and was barred from selling gas turbines in
Italy for one year. Despite their criminal conduct, the two PG managers involved in the
ENEL matter received early retirement with full retirement benefits. The PG CFO
received a â¬1.8 million severance package from Siemens when he left the Company as a
result of the ENEL matter. Ina related criminal proceeding in Germany, the longtime
CFO of PG confessed to authorizing the bribes. Siemensâ corporate response to bribery
assured certain employees that they could expect to be taken care of if and when caught
paying bribes on behalf of the Company.

24. There were additional significant red flags of corruption including
admissions of bribery or so called âbonus paymentsâ to government officials in March
2006 by a manager at Siemens Greece of over â¬37 million, as well as an April 2006
KPMG audit identification of over 250 suspicious payments made through an
intermediary on behalf of Information and Communication Mobile, a corporate

predecessor of COM, and Siemens S.p.A in Italy.
4. Tone at the Top

25. The Vorstandâs response to the situations in Nigeria and Italy
demonstrated a tone at the top of Siemens that was inconsistent with an effective FCPA
compliance program and created a corporate culture in which bribery was tolerated and
even rewarded at the highest levels of the company.

26. Siemens implemented certain improvements to its compliance program in
response to the situation in Italy. These included an anti-bribery speech delivered by the
__ then-CFO to high-level business managers in summier 2004 and the establishment of a |
Corporate Compliance Office in October 2004. In addition, the Company issued policies
over bank accounts, including requirements relating to the initiation and use of Company
accounts and authorizations regarding cash. However, it was not until one year later, in
June 2005, that the Company issued mandatory rules governing the use of business .
consultants, e.g. prohibiting success fees and requiring compliance officers to sign off on
business consulting agreements. While these measures appear to have been partially
effective, improper payments continued at least until the Dawn Raid in November 2006.

27. Despite the Vorstandâs knowledge of bribery at two of its largest eroups -
. COM and PG - the Corporate Compliance Office continued to have a conflicted mandate
and lacked resources. There was an inherent conflict in the Corporate Compliance Office
mandate, which included both defending the Company, and preventing compliance
breaches. The Corporate Compliance Office was significantly understaffed, with a part-
time Chief Compliance Officer, and up to six full-time lawyers until 2007. Despite
knowledge of numerous instances of corruption in multiple areas of the business, the

Company did not implement mandatory FCPA compliance training until 2007.

10
'B. Hlicit Payment Mechanisms Used to Pay Bribes

28. During the Relevant Period, Siemens made thousands of payments to third
parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and ultimate recipient of, the money. The
principal payment mechanisms used to facilitate illicit payments were business
consultants, payment intermediaries, slush funds, cash, and intercompany accounts.

29. Through its use of business consultants and payment intermediaries,
Siemens funneled more than $982.7 million to third parties, including government
officials. All but $27.5 million of the payments were made prior to November 15, 2006.
Business consultants were typically hired pursuant to business consultant agreements,
contracts that on their face obligated Siemens to pay for legitimate consulting services. |
In reality, many business consultant agreements were shams in that the business

_ consultants performed no services beyond funneling bribes. PG had specific instructions
on how to use a âconfidential payment systemâ to conceal payments to business
_consultants. Payment intermediaries were additional entities and individuals through

which Siemens funneled bribes. In many cases, Siemens would pay the intermediary an
amount and simultaneously direct that the money be transferred toa third-party bank
account, less a small portion as the intermediaryâs fee. |

30. Siemens also funneled more than $211 million through slush funds for use

as bribes. All but $2.3 million of the payments were made prior to September 30, 2004.

Slush funds were bank accounts held in the name of current or former senior Siemens

employees, third parties, or affiliated entities. The most notable slush funds were

maintained by a former COM manager recently convicted in Germany for his role in the

il
payment of bribes to foreign officials, which included several slush funds held in the
name of U.S. shell companies.

3t.. Siemens also used cash and cash equivalents to funnel more than $160.4
million to third parties. All but $9.2 million of the payments were made prior to
September 30, 2004. Siemens COM employees used cash desks maintained by the
Siemens Real Estate Group to obtain large amounts of cash to pay bribes. Often,

employees would obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars and, at times, even $1 million .
| in various currencies from the cash desks in Germany. The cash was transported,
sometimes in suitcases, across international borders into various countries. At times, the
cash was then stored in safes maintained by Siemens employees to ensure ready access to
cash to pay bribes.

32. Lastly, Siemens used various types of internal accounts to funnel more
than $16.2 million to third parties. Approximately 99% of the payments were made prior
to September 30, 2005. An intercompany account is a type of Siemensâ internal account
that is used to make payments on transactions between two Siemens entities, i.e., for
entity to entity business. Siemens used the intercompany accounts to make third party
payments and in a number of instances, Siemens maintained the accounts in the names of
unconsolidated entities around the globe, including Ecuador and Nicaragua, in order to
avoid detection. Some of the intercompany accounts maintained at unconsolidated
entities were known to, and possibly created by, a former member of the Vorstand, who
had oversight responsibility for Latin America.

33. As early as 2004, a Siemens Corporate Finance Financial Audit employee

raised concerns about the use of intercompany accounts. He was phased out of his job

12
and assigned to work on âspecial projectsâ from his home until leaving the Company in
2005. Siemens thereafter began closing some of the accounts and eventually closed all of
them.

34. Another type of internal account that employees abused was Siemens
MED internal commission accounts. These balance-sheet accounts were intended to be
used to record commissions MED earned on transactions with other Siemens entities.
These accounts were used to make third party payments. Many of the intercompany
account payments and the MED internal commission account payments were done
manually to bypass Siemensâ automated payment system. The manual payments,
executed through SFS, did not require the submission of documentation in support of a
payment.

35. Siemens used a host of other schemes to make more than $25.3 million in
payments to third parties. In particular, Siemens used sham supplier agreements,
receivables and other write-offs to generate payments.

Cc. Breakdown of Third Party Payments |

36. During the Relevant Period, Siemens made 4,283 separate payments
totaling approximately $1.4 billion to bribe government officials in foreign countries
throughout the world. An additional approximately 1,185 separate payments to third
parties totaling approximately $391 million were not properly controlled and were used, at
least in part, for illicit purposes, including commercial bribery and embezzlement. The

following chart breaks down the $1.4 billion in illicit payments to foreign government _

officials by business group.

D. Bribery of Government Officials

37. The following paragraphs provide examples of bribery schemes involving
projects and individual sales carried out by Siemens using U.S. means during the
Relevant Period with profits of over $1.1 billion.

1. Metro Transit Lines in Venezuela

'38. Between 2001 and 2007, Siemens TS and Siemens S.A., a regional

company in Venezuela, paid an estimated $16.7 million in bribes to Venezuelan
government officials in connection with the construction of metro transit systems in the
âcities of Valencia and Maracaibo, Venezuela. The two proj ects, Metro Valencia and
Metro Maracaibo, generated approximately $642 million in revenue to Siemens. The
Metro Valencia project was awarded to a TS entity in the United States and later

transferred to Siemens, and the Metro Maracaibo project was awarded to Siemens and

14
part of the work was assigned to the U.S. TS entity. Each of the contracts was financed
in part by the U.S. Export-Import Bank in Washington, D.C. The corrupt payments were
made using four separate, overlapping payment schemes.

39. Under the first scheme, Siemens maintained a numbered, off-books bank
account in Panama and either maintained a similar account in Miami or had contacts to a
banker in Miami who had access to such accounts. These accounts were controlled by
two CEOs and two CFOs of Siemensâ regional subsidiary in Venezuela. One of the

_regional CFOs estimated that between 2001 and 2003 he paid $5 to $6 million per year
out of the accounts, a portion of which went to government officials in support of the
Venezuelan projects. The regional CFO periodically destroyed the account statements.

40. Under the second scheme, Siemens paid over $6.8 million to four U.S.-
based entities controlled by a longtime Siemens business consultant. Siemens called
upon the consultant, known as a political âfixerâ in Venezuela and who had been an
advisor to former Venezuelan presidents, to ensure political support for the Maracaibo
and Valencia projects and for Siemensâ role in them. Siemens made payments into the
U.S. bank accounts of the four controlled entities pursuant to sham consulting agreements
in return for no legitimate work. Bank records reveal payments to Venezuelan
government officials and politically-connected individuals, including a high-ranking
member of the central government, two prominent Venezuelan attorneys acting on behalf
of government officials, a former Venezuelan defense minister and diplomat, and a
relative of a local politician, all of whom had influence over these and other Siemens

contracts in Venezuela. Siemens transferred an additional $4.9 million to one of the

15
controlled entities between 2006 and 2007 by artificially inflating the terms of a contract
with a U.S. engineering firm.

41. Under the third scheme, Siemens used a Cyprus-based business consultant
as an intermediary to fund up to $2.5 million in bribe payments on the Valencia project.
Sham agreements were entered into with the business consultant that purported to be for
other Siemens projects, but were actually designed to transfer money to Valencia. This
payment scheme was authorized by a former CFO of the Turnkey Division within the TS
group at Siemens. | |

| 42. . Under the fourth scheme, Siemens in 2002 and 2003 entered into a sham |
agreement with a Dubai-based business consultant to supply Metro Maracaibo with
approximately $2.6 million in workshop equipment. The equipment was actually
supplied by another supplier, and the business consultant did not supply any goods under
the contract. After the business consultant came under suspicion as a result of its
involvement in the investigation of possible bribes paid to ENEL managers in Italy, the
CFO of Siemensâ Turnkey Divisionâs successor was ordered to terminate the contract.
Instead, the new CFO arranged the assignment of the contract to another Dubai-based
business consultant that continued the sham workshop equipment arrangement.

2. Metro Trains and Signaling Devices in China

43. Between 2002 and 2007, Siemens TS paid approximately $22 million to
business consultants who used some portion of those funds to bribe foreign officials in
connection with seven projects for the construction of metro trains and signaling devices
on behalf of government customers in China. The total value of the projects was over $1

billion. After experiencing difficulty breaking into the modern Chinese market, Siemens

16
| began using a Hong-Kong based business consultant and related entities to pay bribes to
influence the award of contracts to Siemens. Siemens typically hired the business
consultant based on an oral agreement to pay a success fee equal to a percentage of the
project value and would enter into 2 written business consulting agreement after the
government contract was awarded to Siemens. In connection with one Shanghai project,
four wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Hong Kong business consultant submitted invoices
totaling $11.7 million to Siemens and requested payment routed through a U.S.
correspondent bank and then to various Swiss accounts. The illicit arrangement was
entered into by a Sales & Marketing manager, who later became a Vice President of
Siemens TS in China with the knowledge and approval of his supervisors. There were
few, if any, legitimate services provided by the business consultant; backdated
agreements and phony work product were used to support at least some of the payments.
E-mails relating to a variety of projects indicate that the business consultant was
funneling money to government officials and âfriendsâ with inside information and
influence over government contracting decisions.

3. Power Plants in Israel
44. Between 2002 and 2005, Siemens PG paid approximately $20 million in

bribes to a former Director of the state-owned Israel Electric Company (âIECâ). The
bribes were paid in connection with four contracts to build and service power plants in -
Israel. The total value of the contracts was approximately $786 million: Siemens routed

âthe corrupt payments through a business consultant owned and managed by the brother
in-law of the CEO of Siemens Israel Limited, a regional subsidiary. The business

consultant was ostensibly paid to âidentify and define sales opportunities, provide market

17
intelligence,â and support contract negotiations. In reality, the business consultant was a
Hong Kong-based clothing company with no expertise in the power generation industry.
The business consultant never provided the services called for under its business |
consultant agreement.

45. â Some of the money paid to the business consultant was traced to the
former IEC Director, who was in a position to influence the award of the contracts won
by Siemens. A portion of the funds passed through U.S. bank accounts.

4. High - Voltage Transmission Lines in China -

46. Between 2002 and 2003, Siemens PTD paid approximately $25 million in
bribes to government customers in connection with two projects for the installation of
high voltage transmission lines in South China.- The total value of the projects was
approximately $838 million. The payments were funneled through multiple
intermediaries, including a Dubai-based business consulting firm controlled by a former
Siemens PTD employee and then paid to several entities associated with a Chinese
business consultant who held a U.S passport and maintained a U.S. residence. Payments
to the Dubai-based business consultant were supported by phony distribution contracts.
Senior management of PTD in Germany approved the payments with the understanding
that they would be shared with âpartnersâ in China, including government officials. In
2002, Siemens used US. banks to funnel $1.2 million in bribes to another business
consultant whose principal shareholders held U.S. passports. That business consultant
also entered into a sham business consultant agreement with Siemens under which no

legitimate services were provided.

18
. 5. Mobile Telephone Services in Bangladesh

47. Between 2004 and 2006, Siemens COM paid approximately $5.3 million
in bribes to government officials in Bangladesh in connection with a contract with the
Bangladesh Telegraph & Telephone Board (âBTTBâ) to install mobile telephone
services. The total value of the contract was approximately $40.9 million. The payments
âwere made to three business consultants pursuant to sham agreements calling for services
associated with the mobile telephone project. The ultimate recipients of the payments
- included the son of the then-Prime Minister in Bangladesh, the Minister of the Ministry
of Posts & Telecommunications in Bangladesh, and the BTTB Director of Procurement.
In addition, Siemens Limited Bangladesh, a regional company, hired relatives of two
other BTTB and Ministry of Post and Telecom officials. Most of the money paid to the
business consultants was routed through correspondent accounts in the United States,
with at least one payment originating from a U.S. account. Since approximately
September 2004, a Siemens business consultant who served as a principal payment
intermediary on the Bangladesh bribe payments has been resident in the United States.
At least $1.7 million of the bribe payments made through this intermediary were paid into
a Hong Kong bank account while the intermediary was residing in the United States.

48. ~The involvement of senior officials at Siemensâ regional company in
Bangladesh, including a former CEO and the director of the regional companyâs COM
division, in the bribery scheme is revealed both in statements by the officials and in |
internal email messages, several of which include the tagline, âkindly delete this mail

once the purpose is done.â

19
6. Four Telecommunications Projects in Nigeria

49. Siemens COM made approximately $12.7 million in suspicious payments
in connection with Nigerian projects, with at least $4.5 million paid as bribes in
connection with four telecommunications projects with government customers in Nigeria,
including Nigeria Telecommunications Limited and the Ministry of Communications.
The total value of the four contracts was approximately $130 million. The practice of
paying bribes by Siemens COM in Nigeria was long-standing and systematic. According
to a high ranking official within Siemens Limited Nigeria, a regional company, corrupt
payments in 2000 and 2001 commonly reached 15 to 30% of the contractsâ value. Bribe
payments were typically documented using fictitious business consultant agreements
under which no actual services were performed. The CEO of Siemens Limited Nigeria
forwarded requests for âcommissionâ payments to Siemens headquarters in Germany.
The illicit payments were then made through a number of means, frequently including
large cash withdrawals from cash desks that were then hand-carried in suitcases to
Nigeria.

50. _. In the four telecommunications projects, approximately $2.8 million of the
bribe payments was routed through a bank account in Potomac, Maryland, in the name of
the wife of a former Nigerian Vice President. The Vice Presidentâs wife, a dual U.S.-
Nigerian citizen living in the United States, served as the representative of a business
consultant that entered into fictitious business consultant agreements to perform âsupply,
installation, and commissioningâ services but did no actual work for Siemens. The
purpose of these payments was to bribe government officials. Other corrupt payments

- included the purchase of approximately $172,000 in watches for Nigerian officials

20
designated in internal Siemens records as âP.â and âV-P.,â likely referring to the
President and Vice-President of Nigeria. |

7. Identity Card Project in Argentina

51. Between 1998 and 2004, Siemens paid over $40 million in bribes to senior
officials of the government of Argentina in an effort to secure a $1 billion project to
produce national identity cards. Siemens officials between 1998 and 1999, including the
then-CEO of Siemens regional company in Argentina, âSiemens S.A., caused $19 million
to be paid to business consultants for bribes. At least $2.6 million was transferred from
the business consultantsâ accounts directly to the President of Argentina, the Minister of
the Interior, and the Head of Immigration Control to obtain the contract. During this
period, Siemens officials promised to pay an additional $30 million or more to the
President and his Cabinet ministers. In late 1999, the Argentine President ended his term
when his party was voted out of office, and the new administration threatened to
terminate the contract on the ground that it had been procured by fraud. In an effort to
head off that possibility, Siemens paid $6 million in additional bribes to officials in the
new Argentine administration. Despite these payments, the contract was nonetheless
canceled in May 2001.

52. Over the following four years, Siemens officials received a series of
payment demands and threats against its employees in Argentina if it did not fulfill its
past commitment to pay additional bribes. Between 2002 and 2004, Siemens paid over
_ $23 million to settle these demands. The Siemens officials involved in authorizing the |
payments included a member of the Vorstand, who in 2003 personally flew to the United

States to meet with Siemensâ principal intermediary to negotiate the payment terms, as

21
well as the CEO and CFO of Siemensâ regional company in Argentina. Approximately
$9.5 million of these payments were routed through the books of an unrelated PTD ~
transmission project in China in an effort to conceal the payments from Siemensâ internal
auditors. Other payments were made through USS. bank accounts based on fictitious
invoices for non-existent past services in connection with the identity card project and
other projects in the region, including payments to a former government Minister and
member of the Argentine Congress. â

8. Medical Devices in Vietnam .

53. Siemens MED paid $183,000 in early 2005 and $200,000 in early 2006 in
connection with the sale of approximately $6 million of medical devices on two projects
involving the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. After learning that bribe payments were
required in Vietnam, Siemens MED sought the name of the business consultant entrusted
by Siemens TS to conduct business in that market, including making its bribe payments.
Siemens MED then entered into an agreement with an affiliate of the group of Hong-
Kong based business consultants used by Siemens TS to act as Siemens MEDâs payment .
intermediary. The payments were routed through a U.S. correspondent bank and then to
Singapore bank accounts of the Hong Kong business consultant. The amounts were then
withdrawn in cash and transported to Vietnam. Project calculation sheets connected to
the sales describe the payments to the intermediary as relating to âroom preparation.â A
number of Siemens senior managers, including the then-CFO of Siemensâ business in
Vietnam, admitted that the purpose of the payments was to bribe government officials.

54. With regard to the $183,000 payment that was made in early 2005, the

former CFO of Siemens Limited Vietnam (âSLVâ) described how he and the then CEO

22
of Siemens SLV picked up an envelope with $183,000 cash at a hotel in Singapore âfrom
a Hong Kong business manâ and flew to the Hanoi airport where the money was left with
the then-head of Siemens MED in Vietnam, who had primary responsibility for contract
negotiations with officials at the Vietnamese Ministry of Health.

9. Medical Devices in China

55. Between 2003 and 2007, Siemens MED paid approximately $14.4 million
in bribes to the same intermediary described above in connection with $295 million in
sales of medical equipment to five Chinese-owned hospitals, as well as to fund lavish
trips for Chinese doctors. The former controller of Siemens oversaw the business

relationship between Siemens and the affiliate of the Hong-Kong-based intermediary that
it used to pay the bribes. A majority of the sales on which the intermediary received a
payment involved a bribe to a government official. The same intermediary was used by
Siemens TS to pay bribes in China and by Siemens MED to pay bribes in Vietnam.

56. For example, Siemens paid $64,800 in May 2006 in connection with the
sale of a $1.5 million MRI system to the Songyuan City Central Hospital in China. The
payment was sent to a U.S. bank account, and later routed to a Singapore bank account in
the name of the intermediary. A project calculation sheet signed by the then-CFO of
Siemens MED China described the payment as relating to âexpenses (commission)â;
however, no services were provided by the intermediary aside from acting as a vehicle
for the transfer of bribe payments. In or around March 2008, Songyuan Hospitalâs
deputy director and head of the radiology department was convicted in China of

corruption charges, including a charge for accepting a $60,000 bribe from a

23
Siemens salesperson in connection with the sale of the MRI system and sentenced to
fourteen years in prison.

57. Siemens also used the Hong Kong intermediary to pay $9 million in travel
costs for âstudy tripsâ taken by doctors who worked at government-owned hospitals in
China. The study trips, which included lavish trips to Las Vegas, Miami, and other
vacation spots in the United States, were connected to at least 231 separate sales to
hospitals awarded to Siemens with revenue of approximately $235 million. The former
CFO of Siemens MED in China used the intermediary to pay for study trips because of
- .concems about the lavishness and ânon-scientific contentâ of the trips, which were taken
by doctors-who were in a position to award business to Siemens.

58. Bribes were also paid to secure sales of medical equipment to hospitals in
. China on behalf of two Siemens U.S.-based subsidiaries, Oncology Care Solutions
(âOCSâ) in California and Molecular Imaging (âMIâ) in Illinois. For OCS, Siemens
developed a scheme to minimize the risk of anti-bribery prosecution in the United States
for these transactions by routing the approval of business consulting agreements and the
payment of business consultants through Siemensâ headquarters in Germany rather than
in the United States. Between 1998 and 2004, this scheme was used to approve improper
payments of approximately $650,000 to Chinese business consultants in connection with
the U.S.-related sales. A senior manager at Siemens MED in Germany and officials of
the U.S.-based subsidiaries, including the CFOs of OCS and MI were aware of the
business consultant payments and facilitated the scheme by verifying the amounts to be
paid and that the payments were due and owing. At one point after approving twenty-six

such payments, the senior manager at Siemens MED refused to continue the payment

24
scheme, citing concern for the welfare of his family if he were sent to prison. The CFO
of MED attempted to pressure the senior manager to keep the payment scheme going, but
without success. | |

59. In 2005, these officials also verified that âclean upâ payments totaling
over $500,000 were owed to Siemensâ Hong Kong-based intermediary in connection with
sales by OCS and MI in China. The outstanding payments were for bribes owed to third
parties on behalf of Siemens. After receiving confirmation from OCS and MI that the
payments were outstanding, the former controller of Siemens Med authorized three
âclean upâ payments in 2005 for $377,400, $140,000 and $44,000.

10. Traffic Control System in Russia

60. From 2004 to 2006, Siemens 1&s and OOO Siemens, a regional company
in Russia, paid approximately $741,419 in bribes to government officials in connection
with a World Bank-funded project for the design and installation of a $27 million traffic
control system in Moscow called the Moscow Third Ring Project. First, Siemens paid
money to its business consultant who simultaneously worked as a technical consultant for
the Moscow Project Implementation Unit (the âMPIUâ), a quasi-governmental unit that
ran the Moscow Third Ring project. The MPIU hired the technical consultant at
Siemensâ suggestion. From 2004 to 2006, Siemens paid approximately $313,000 to three
entities associated with the technical consultant, with at least $141,419 of the payment in
exchange for favorable treatment in the tendering process. The technical consultant used
his position at the MPIU to create tender specifications favorable to Siemens, to provide

tender documents to Siemens before their official publication, to evaluate project bids in

25
a way that ensured Siemens would win the contract, and to assist during the
implementation phase of the proj ect.

61. Second, Siemens colluded with a competitor who agreed to inflate its
project bid to ensure Siemens won the project. In return, Siemens hired the competitor at
an inflated rate of approximately $800,000. Siemens also hired two of the competitorâs
former consortium members to become subcontractors to Siemens on the project
(âSubcontractor A and Subcontractor Bâ). Siemens paid Subcontractor A approximately
$1.3 million for a sham traffic study and approximately $1.4 million to Subcontractor B
for other alleged services. In fact, both subcontractors were used to funnel at least
$600,000 of the $741,419 described in paragraph 60 to senior officials of the MPIU.

11. Refinery Modernization Project in Mexico

62.  Inlate 2004, Siemens PG and Siemens S.A. de CV, a regional entity,
made three separate illicit payments totaling approximately $2.6 million to a politically-
connected business consultant to assist in settling cost overrun claims in connection with
three refinery modernization projects in Mexico. Some portion of these payments were
routed through the business consultant to a senior official of the Mexican state-owned
petroleum company, Petroleos Mexicanos (âPemexâ). The official was in a position to
influence the settlement. The payments were made with the knowledge and approval of
the then-CEO of Siemensâ regional company in Mexico. The payments ware supported -
by invoices reflecting consulting services that were not provided or only vaguely

| described. A portion of Siemensâ work on the contracts was performed by a regional
subsidiary in Atlanta, and some of the contract financing was provided by the U.S.

Export-Import Bank in Washington, DC.

26
12. Medical Devices in Russia

63. Between 2000 and 2007, Siemens MED made improper payments of over
$55 million to a Dubai-based business consultant in connection with sales of medical
equipment in Russia. The business consultant was used as a payment intermediary for
bribes to government-owned customers in Russia. The former CFO of Siemens MED
knew of and approved the payments. Senior Siemens officials estimated that up to 80%
of Siemensâ MED business in Russia involved illicit payments. On one such transaction
in 2006, Siemens made payments of approximately $287,914, some of which was used
for bribes, in connection with the $2.5 million sale of a computer tomograph system to a
public hospital in Ekaterinburg. On this contract, the bribes were routed through the
Dubai-based business consultant, as well as a second business consultant that was
registered in Des Moines, Iowa.

13. | GSM Mobile Network Services in Vietnam

64. In 2002, Siemens COM paid approximately $140,000 in bribes in
connection with a tender worth approximately $35 million for the supply of equipment
and services related to a Global Systems mobile network for Vietel, a government owned
telecommunications provider founded by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense. Two
separate payments totaling $140,000 were made to the Singapore account of a Siemens
business consultant. | The payments were then routed through a U.S. correspondent
account and likely paid to officials at the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense. The payments
were part of a much larger bribery scheme concocted by high-level managers at Siemens |
regional company in Vietnam, SLV, to pay bribes to government officials at Vietel and

the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense in order to acquire Phase I of the Vietel GSM tender.

27
In a June 2002, facsimile that discussed the bribery scheme, the former head of COM
sales for the regional company described Siemensâ explicit agreement to pay 8% of the
value of the Vietel project to officials at the Ministry of Defense and 14% of the project
value to officials at Vietel. In August and September 2002, Siemens signed agreements
with two business consultants who were retained for the sole purpose of funneling the
bribes to government officials connected to Vietel. Ultimately, Siemens was
unsuccessful in its pursuit of the Vietel project and lost the tender before paying

additional bribes.

E. The Oil for Food Program

65. The Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for
the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under the international trade sanctions
that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Program permitted the Iraqi
government to sell its crude oil and use the proceeds to purchase food, medicine, and
critical infrastructure supplies. The proceeds of the oil sales were transferred directly
from the buyers to an escrow account (the âU.N. Escrow Accountâ) maintained in New
York by the United Nations 661 Committee. Funds in the U.N. Escrow Account were
available for the purchase of humanitarian supplies, subject to U.N. approval and
supervision. The intent of this structure was to prevent the proceeds of Iraqâs crude oil
sales from undermining the sanctions regime by supplying cash to Saddam Hussein.

66. Comuption was rampant within the Program. By mid-2000, Iraqi
ministries on the instruction of top government officials instituted a policy requiring
suppliers of humanitarian goods to pay a ten percent kickback on each contract. This

kickback requirement was euphemistically referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee

28
(âASSFâ); however, no services were provided. Suppliers competing to obtain contracts
under the Program were encouraged to include a ten percent markup in their bids or
purchase orders. The inflated contract prices were incorporated into the Oil for Food
contracts as a way to permit the suppliers to recover from the U.N. Escrow Account the
kickback payments they had paid secretly to Iraq. Following the 2004 release of a report
by the U.S. General Accounting Office exposing some of the abuses, the U.N.
commissioned an independent inquiry committee, headed by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker (the âVolcker Committeeâ), to investigate the Programâs
performance. That committeeâs October 27, 2005, final report estimated that the Iraqi
government had diverted $1.7 billion in illicit income from the Program.

1. Siemensâ Involvement in the Oil for Food Program

67. Siemens participated in the Program through two of its regional
companies, Siemens S.A.S. (âSiemens Franceâ) and Siemens Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.
(âSiemens Turkeyâ) and two subsidiaries, Osram Middle East FZE (âOsram MEâ) and
Gas Turbine Technologies SpA (âGTTâ). In total, 42 Oil for Food contracts were entered
into, and secret kickback payments of approximately $1.7 million were made to Iraqi
controlled accounts in order to avoid detection by the U.N. Total revenues on the
contracts were over $124 million with profits of approximately $38,226,537. The
payments were characterized as after sales service fees; however, no services were
actually rendered. The ASSFs were effectively bribes paid to the Iraqi regime, which
Siemens improperly disguised on its books and records by mischaracterizing the bribes as

legitimate commissions.

29
2. Siemens France .

68. From approximately September 2000 to July 2001, Siemens France
entered into twelve contracts covering power station renovation, servicing and spare parts
with the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity and paid illicit ASSF s of approximately $321,745.
The contracts were artificially inflated by 10% and then submitted to the U.N. for
payment. The U.N. was not informed that the contracts had been inflated or that Siemens
France intended to pay illicit kickbacks to Iraq.

69. For instance, in July 2000 Siemens submitted a bid for the refurbishment
of cranes at the Daura Power Station in Iraq. The purchase order was subsequently
signed in November 2000, and included a 10% increase in the contract value. Shortly
thereafter, in January 2001, Siemens signed a Supplement to its business consultant |
agreement with its local agent in Iraq providing for a 10% commission to the agent for
âafter sales services and activities.â The document was unusual because it provided a
higher agent compensation than was usually provided on such contracts; it was
âinconsistent with Siemensâ practiceâ which required specification and pricing of any
true after sales services; and because there was only one Siemens signatory on the
contract. In various letters and memoranda, one former Siemens salesman documented
discussions that he had with Iraqi officials regarding the requirement of ASSFs. Ina
memorandum written by another Siemens employee discussing how to make the ASSF
payments, the employee stated that Siemensâ agent in Iraq told him that another Siemens
subsidiary, Siemens Turkey, had chosen to pay ASSFs in cash âso that no names appear

on paper.â

30
70. Siemens France used a local agent in Iraq to deposit the ASSF payments
in cash into a Jordanian bank account held by two Iraqi officials, which were later
transferred to an account controlled by the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity. The local agent
confirmed the bank deposits were made on behalf of Siemens and bank records reflect the
payments. When making the ASSF payments, the local agent used the name of an
acquaintance who did not work for Siemens so as to conceal his true identity.

3. Siemens Turkey

71. From approximately September 2000 to June 2002, Siemens Turkey
entered into twenty contracts relating to the building and rehabilitation of power stations,
and paid after sales service fees totaling approximately $1,243,119. Many aspects of
Siemens Turkeyâs involvement in the Oil for Food Program were similar to those of
- Siemens France. Both companies used the same local agent in Iraq and both dealt
principally with the Ministry of Electricity in their payment of illicit ASSFs. As
described above, a Siemens employee stated that the agent informed him that Siemens
Turkey was paying ASSFs in cash âso that no names appear on paper.â Siemens? local
agent also deposited some ASSFs into a Jordanian bank account controlled by Iraqi
| officials.

4. Osram Middle East

72. From approximately May 2000 to June 2002, Osram Middle East
(âOsramâ), a Siemens subsidiary, entered into six contracts with state companies within
the Ministry of Oil, and paid ASSFs of approximately $89,250 for the sale of lighting
equipment. Osram employees admitted that Siemensâ local agent relayed the Ministry of

Oilâs demand for ASSFs sometime in late 2000. On three of the contracts, Osram entered

31
into secret side agreements agreeing to pay a 10% kickback to the Iraqi ministry. The
local agent signed each of the side letters on Osramâs behalf. The contracts between
Osram and the Ministry of Oil typically contained a 10% markup for ASSFs. The
inflated contracts were submitted to the U.N. for approval, but the U.N. was not informed
that the contracts were inflated and the side letters were not disclosed. The agent
admitted that he made the ASSF payments to Jordanian bank accounts held for the
benefit of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil on Osramâs behalf.

5. GIT

73. Beginning in 2001, GTT entered into four contracts with the Ministry of
Electricity in which ASSFs of $81,962 were paid. For each contract, the value of the
contract was increased by approximately 10% between the submission of the initial bid
and the signing of the purchase order. GIT employees admit to the ASSF kickback
scheme, and documents reflect that GITâs agent in Iraq informed GTT that ASSF
payments were a condition to obtaining contracts. Though all of the contracts were
signed before 2003, none were performed before the start of the Iraqi war. After the war

ASSF. | |
F. Siemens Employed U.S. Means to Engage in Bribery

74. In total, Siemens made bribe payments directly or indirectly to foreign
government officials in connection with at least 290 projects or individual sales involving
business in Venezuela, China, Israel, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Argentina, Vietnam, Russia,
and Mexico that employed the mails and other means and instrumentalities of U.S.

interstate commerce. The corrupt payments were made to government officials or their

32
designees for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business in connection to the above
projects. The use of interstate commerce in connection with bribery included involving
U.S.-based Siemens subsidiaries and their employees in the bribery schemes; financing of
three underlying projects by the World Bank and the U.S. Export-Import Bank; making
illegal payments through U.S. banks; using US.-based companies as intermediaries,
business consultants, and holders of slush funds; conducting meetings in the United
States in furtherance of a bribery scheme; and transmitting mail, electronic mail, and
facsimile messages into and out of the United States.
G. Siemens Failed to Maintain Its Books and Records

75. During the Relevant Period, Siemens made thousands of payments to third
parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the |
payments. In particular, Siemens paid approximately $1.4 billion in bribes to foreign
government officials. Doing so involved the falsification of Siemensâ books and records
by employees throughout the Company. Specifically, Siemens failed to keep accurate
books and records by: 1) establishing and funding secret, off-books accounts; 2)
establishing and using a system of payment intermediaries to obscure the source and
destination of funds; 3) making payments pursuant to business consultant agreements that
inaccurately described the services provided; 4) generating false invoices and other false
documents to justify payments; 5) disbursing millions in cash from cash desks with
inaccurate documentation authorizing or supporting the withdrawals; 6) using post-it
notes for the purpose of concealing the identity of persons authorizing illicit payments;

7) recording illicit ASSF payments as legitimate commissions in Oil for Food

33
transactions; 8) falsifying U.N. documents in connection with the Oil for Food Program;
and 9) recording bribes as payment for legitimate services. | |
H. â Siemens Failed to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

76.. Siemens failed to implement adequate internal controls to comply with the
Companyâs NYSE listing, including the detection and prevention of violations of the
FCPA. First, Siemens engaged in the knowing falsification of books and records.
Siemens established numerous off-books accounts and secret slush funds for the purpose
of obscuring the purpose for, and ultimate recipient of, illicit payments. Elaborate
payment mechanisms were used to conceal the fact that bribe payments were made
around the globe to obtain business, including the PG confidential payment system and
extensive use of business consultants and intermediaries to funnel bribes. False invoices
and payment documentation was created to make payments to business consultants under
false business consultant agreements that identified services that were never intended to
be rendered. Illicit payments were falsely recorded as expenses for management fees,
consulting fees, supply contracts, room preparation fees, and commissions. Documents
related to its participation in the Oil for Food Program were also inaccurate. Siemens
inflated U.N. contracts, signed side agreements with Iraqi ministries that were not
disclosed to the U.N., and recorded the ASSF payments as legitimate commissions
despite U.N., U.S., and international sanctions against such payments.

77. Second, Siemens employees routinely circumvented the internal controls
the Company had in place. Slush funds were opened in the names of former and current
employees and maintained off-books. At any given point, Siemens had no central record

_of the true number of bank accounts opened on its behalf, from which, millions in illicit

34
payments were made. Despite a âfour-eyesâ policy that required two signatures on
â Company documents to authorize transactions, a significant number of business
consultant agreements were entered into and a significant number of payments were
authorized in violation of the policy. In many instances, signatures authorizing the
withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of dollars from cash desks were placed on post-it
notes and later removed in order to eradicate any permanent record of the approvals. In
numerous instances, officials signing documents failed to conduct any review of the
documents. For example, an official who authorized payments on behalf of Siemensâ
Russian regional subsidiary authorized payments despite his inability to read the
language in which the supporting documentation of the payments were prepared.
Siemens officials frequently misused internal accounts by transferring money from-one
Siemens entity to another without any legitimate business purpose or proper
documentation of the disposition of the funds. Siemens officials modified the format of
agreements to avoid internal controls on the use of business consultants by backdating
agreements, misidentifying counterparties as âagentsâ rather than âbusiness consultants,â
and obscuring the amounts paid to business consultants by splitting the payments among
separate agreements. |

78. Finally, Siemens failed to establish adequate internal controls despite its
knowledge that corruption was rampant. Siemens did not issue mandatory and
comprehensive Company-wide controls regarding the use of business consultants until
June 2005, well after senior officials were aware of widespread bribery in the Companyâs
two largest divisions, COM and PG. Despite those controls, due diligence on business

consultants remained largely inadequate, and payments continued to be made without

35
adequate proof of services rendered. Siemens failed to establish controls over numerous
off-books accounts held on its behalf around the world. The Company maintained no
central list of corporate accounts held at unconsolidated entities or in the names of
individual Siemens officials. Siemens failed to establish controls over cash
disbursements, allowed manual payments without documentation, and failed to ensure the
proper use of intercompany accounts. Siemens failed to establish an effective central
compliance function. The compliance office lacked independence and was severely
understaffed. Siemens tone at the top was inadequate for a law abiding entity, and

| employees engaged in bribery and other misconduct on behalf of the Company were not
| adequately disciplined. Siemens also failed to conduct appropriate anti-bribery and
corruption training.

SEC Charges Siemens AG for Engaging in Worldwide
Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2008-294

Washington, D.C., Dec. 15, 2008 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced an unprecedented settlement with Siemens AG to resolve
SEC charges that the Munich, Germany-based manufacturer of industrial and
consumer products violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by
engaging in a systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government
officials to obtain business.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 20829
Â®Â» SEC Complaint

 

The SEC alleges that Siemens paid bribes on such widespread transactions as
the design and construction of metro transit lines in Venezuela, power plants
in Israel, and refineries in Mexico. Siemens also used bribes to obtain such
business as developing mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh, national
identity cards in Argentina, and medical devices in Vietnam, China, and
Russia. According to the SEC's complaint, Siemens also paid kickbacks to Iraqi
ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq
under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned more than
$1.1 billion in profits on these and several other transactions.

Siemens has agreed to pay $350 million in disgorgement to settle the SEC's
charges, and a $450 million fine to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle
criminal charges. Siemens also will pay a fine of approximately $569 million to
the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, to whom the company
previously paid an approximately $285 million fine in October 2007.

""Public companies that bribe foreign officials are confronting an increasingly
well-coordinated international law enforcement effort,"" said SEC Chairman
Christopher Cox. ""The SEC has brought a record number of enforcement
actions for foreign bribery during the past two years, and heightened
international cooperation has been critical to those successful efforts.
Seimens paid staggering amounts of money to circumvent the rules and gain
business. Now, they will pay for it with the largest settlement in the history of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act since it became law in 1977.""

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said,
""This pattern of bribery by Siemens was unprecedented in scale and
geographic reach. The corruption alleged in the SEC's complaint involved
more than $1.4 billion in bribes to government officials in Asia, Africa, Europe,
the Middle East, and the Americas. Our success in bringing the company to
justice is a testament to the close, coordinated working relationship among
the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice, and international law enforcement,
particularly the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich.""

Cheryl J. Scarboro, an Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Enforcement,
said, ""The day is past when multi-national corporations could regard illicit
payments to foreign officials as simply another cost of doing business. The
$1.6 billion in combined sanctions that Siemens will pay in the U.S. and
Germany should make clear that these corrupt business practices will be
rooted out wherever they take place, and the sanctions for them will be
severe.""

The SEC's complaint alleges that between March 12, 2001, and Sept. 30,
2007, Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of
its corrupt payments, and the company's inadequate internal controls allowed
the conduct to flourish. Siemens made thousands of payments to third parties
in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the
money. Employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash desks, which
were sometimes transported in suitcases across international borders for
bribery. The authorizations for payments were placed on post-it notes and
later removed to eradicate any permanent record. Siemens used numerous
slush funds, off-books accounts maintained at unconsolidated entities, and a
system of business consultants and intermediaries to facilitate the corrupt
payments. Siemens made at least 4,283 payments, totaling approximately
$1.4 billion, to bribe government officials in return for business to Siemens
around the world. In addition, Siemens made approximately 1,185 separate
payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million, which were not
properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for such illicit purposes as
commercial bribery and embezzlement.
The misconduct involved employees at all levels, including former senior
management, and revealed a corporate culture long at odds with the FCPA.
The SEC's complaint alleges that despite the company's knowledge of bribery
at two of its largest groups â Communications and Power Generation â the
tone at the top at Siemens was inconsistent with an effective FCPA
compliance program and created a corporate culture in which bribery was
tolerated and even rewarded at the highest levels of the company. In
November 2006, Siemens' current management began to implement reforms
to the company's internal controls, which substantially reduced, but did not
entirely eliminate, corrupt payments. All but $27.5 million of the corrupt
payments occurred before Nov. 15, 2006.

Siemens violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act) by making illicit payments to foreign government officials in
order to obtain or retain business. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and
prevent the payments. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange
Act by improperly recording the payments in its books and records.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Siemens has consented to
the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of
Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to
pay $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits, which does not include
profits factored into Munich's fine; and ordering it to comply with certain
undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program, including an
independent monitor for a period of four years. Since being approached by
SEC staff, Siemens has cooperated fully with the ongoing investigation.
Siemens' massive internal investigation and lower level employee amnesty
program was essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of Siemens'
FCPA violations.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud
Section; the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, Fraud and
Public Corruption Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal
Revenue Service; the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany;
the U.K. Financial Services Authority; and the Hong Kong Securities and
Futures Commission.

Defendants.

COMPLAINT
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) files this suit
against Defendants Willbros Group, Inc. (âWillbros Groupâ), Jason Steph (âStephâ), Gerald
Jansen (âJansenâ), Lloyd Biggers (ââBiggersâ) and Carlos Galvez (âGalvezâ) and would
respectfully show the Court as follows:
SUMMARY
1. This action arises from multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ) and the antifraud, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal
securities laws by Willbros Group and certain of its former employees.
2. From at least 2003 through early 2005, Willbros Group, through acts taken by
various employees and officers of certain of its affiliates, violated the FCPA by authorizing

bribery schemes to make corrupt payments to foreign officials in Nigeria to assist in obtaining

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT

and retaining business for Willbros Group and its subsidiaries. These employees and officers
have since resigned or were terminated as employees and include the former President of the
companyâs subsidiary Willbros International (âFormer President of Willbros Internationalâ) and
Jason Steph, a former general manager of one of the companyâs Nigerian subsidiaries. In
Nigeria, the scheme entailed authorizing the payment of over $6 million in bribes to various
officials to obtain at least two significant contracts. From these two contracts, Willbros Group
realized approximately $8.9 million in net profits.

3. Similarly, in Ecuador, the Former President of Willbros International
orchestrated, in violation of the FCPA, a promise to pay $300,000 in bribes to officials of
PetroEcuador, an oil and gas company wholly-owned by the government of Ecuador, and its
subsidiary, PetroComercial. The bribes were made to influence the awarding of a contract that
ultimately generated total revenues exceeding $3 million.

4, In addition, certain former employees of Willbrosâ subsidiaries employed a long-
running fraudulent scheme to use the companyâs petty cash accounts in Nigeria to make a variety
of corrupt payments to Nigerian tax and court officials. Through this scheme, the employees and
officers caused Willbros Group to violate the FCPA, and the books and records and internal
control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ). In turn, Steph and
Jansen aided and abetted violations of the FCPA and the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Exchange Act. Biggers, through his part in the scheme, aided and abetted
violations of the FCPA and the books and records provisions of the Exchange Act.

5. Separately, Willbros Group, through certain of its former employees, including
the Former President of Willbros International and Galvez, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to
minimize the tax obligations of its subsidiary operating in Bolivia. This scheme involved the

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-2
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 3 of 25

acquisition and use of falsified invoices that allowed the company to claim inflated offsets to its
âvalue-added taxesâ (âVATâ) obligation. This scheme resulted in material misstatements in the
financial statements Willbros Group included within certain Commission filings. As a result of
these material misrepresentations, Willbros Group violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of
1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
along with the books and records, internal controls and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.
Galvez, through his contributions to the scheme, illegally falsified books and records and aided
and abetted Willbros Groupâs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and the books and
records, internal controls and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.

6. The Commission, in the interest of protectirig the public from any further illegal
activity, brings this action against the Defendants seeking permanent injunctive relief to prevent
future violations of the federal securities laws and, with regard to Defendants Steph, Jansen and
Galvez, civil monetary penalties.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Exchange Act Sections
21(d)(3) and 27 [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d)(3) and 78aa]. Defendants, directly and indirectly, made
use of the mails and of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection
with the acts, practices and courses of business described in this Complaint. Venue is proper
because many of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business described below
occurred within the jurisdiction of the Southern District of Texas.

DEFENDANTS

8. Willbros Group, Inc., an international oil and gas pipeline company, is a

corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Panama. Until 2000, it had its

Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 4 of 25

administrative headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma; in 2000, it moved its administrative

headquarters to its current location, Houston, Texas. Willbros Group, which became a public
company in 1996, has a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is therefore an âissuerâ as that
term is used in the FCPA (15 U.S.C. Section 78dd-1(a)). |

9. Jason Edward Steph is a citizen of the United States and a former employee of
Willbros International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willbros Group. Steph was employed by
Willbros International from approximately 1998 to April 2005, when he resigned. He served
as the General Manager-Onshore in Nigeria for Willbros International from 2002 to April
2005.

10. Gerald Jansen is a Canadian national who formerly worked for Willbros
International in Nigeria from approximately 1993 to 1995 and again from 1998 through May
2005, when his employment was terminated. His most recent position with the company was
Administrator and General Manager - Finance for Willbros International.

11. Lloyd Biggers is a citizen of the United States who formerly worked for
Willbros International. He was assigned to Nigeria from approximately 1995 through his
termination as an employee in April 2005.

12. Carlos Galvez is a citizen of the United States who formerly worked in an
accounting and administrative supervisory role for Willbros International in connection with
the companyâs operations in Bolivia. His employment terminated in 2005.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Willbros and Its Operation in Nigeria, Ecuador, and Bolivia

13. During the relevant time period, Willbros Group conducted its operations
outside of North America through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc.
Like Willbros Group, Willbros International is incorporated in Panama and maintained its

administrative headquarters in Tulsa until 2000, when it moved to Houston.

14. Until it sold its Nigerian assets in February 2007, the company had conducted
business in Nigeria for over 40 years â primarily through three affiliates:- Willbros West
Africa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willbros International; Willbros Nigeria, Ltd., a
majority-owned subsidiary of Willbros West Africa; and Willbros Offshore Nigeria, Inc., a
majority-owned subsidiary of Willbros West Africa. Before the sale of Nigerian assets in
2007, the companyâs operations in Nigeria frequently represented a sizable percentage of the
companyâs global revenues. In 2004, for example, the Nigerian operations produced roughly
25% of the companyâs global revenue.

15. During the relevant time period, Willbros Group conducted business in
Ecuador through a subsidiary of Willbros International, known as Willbros Servicios Obras y
Sistemas S.A. (âWillbros Ecuadorâ). In 2004, the company, through Willbros Ecuador,
undertook a project called the Proyecto Santo Domingo. The client on this project was
PetroComercial, a subsidiary of PetroEcuador. PetroEcuador is Ecuadorâs state-owned oil and
gas company.

16. During the relevant time period, Willbros Group conducted business in Bolivia
through a subsidiary of Willbros International, known as Willbros Transandina. In late 2001,
the company, through Willbros Transandinaâs participation in a joint venture, obtained a 59
million dollar contract with a foreign consortium to construct a pipeline in Bolivia (the
âYacuiba-Rio Grande projectâ). Work on this project commenced in 2002 and was
substantially complete by 2003. Contract resolution and settlement of contract variations were

not finalized until 2004.

Bribery Scheme in Nigeria

17. Beginning in at least 2003, Willbros Group, acting through the Former President
of Willbros International, Steph and others, designed and implemented schemes to help Willbros

Group and its affiliates obtain at least two significant contracts in Nigeria: an onshore project

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-5
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 6 of 25

known as the the Eastern Gas Gathering Systems project (âEGGSâ project) and a separate
offshore contract (âthe Nigerian Offshore Contractâ). These projects were to be completed on
behalf of two different joint ventures. Each joint venture was majority-owned by Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (âNNPCâ), an arm of the Nigerian government, and each had an
operator that was a subsidiary of a major multi-national oil company.

18. The EGGS and Nigerian Offshore Contract projects: generated cumulative
revenue to Willbros Group of approximately 487 million dollars and net profits of approximately
$8,910,000.

19. To pursue certain projects in Nigeria, Willbros West Africa formed a joint venture
consortium with a Nigerian subsidiary of a German engineering and construction company (âthe
Willbros Nigeria Consortiumâ). In December 2003, the Willbros Nigeria Consortium submitted
a commercial proposal seeking to be awarded some or all of the EGGS project, a natural gas
pipeline system. The project contemplated two primary phases, referred to as EGGS Phase 1 and
EGGS Phase 2. EGGS Phase 1 involved engineering, procurement and construction (âEPCâ) of
a pipeline and included an optional scope of work for the application of a coating to the pipeline
(âEGGS Coatingâ). EGGS Phase 2 was another optional scope of work within the EGGS Phase
1 proposal involving the construction of a second pipeline.

20. The commercial proposal was submitted to the operator of a joint venture that is
controlled by NNPC, an arm of the Nigerian government, and its subsidiary, the National
Petroleum Investment Management Services (âNAPIMSâ). In this complaint, the joint venture
client related to the EGGS project will be referred to as the âNigeria Joint Venture;â the operator

of Nigerian Joint Venture will be referred to as âJoint Venture Operator;â and the employees,

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-6
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 7 of 25

agents, and officials of the Joint Venture Operator, the Nigerian Joint Venture, NNPC, and
NAPIMS will be referred to collectively as âNigerian officials.â

21. In July 2004, after approval by NNPC and NAPIMS, the Willbros Nigeria
Consortium and the Joint Venture Operator (acting on behalf of the Nigeria Joint Venture)
executed the EGGS Phase | contract. The contract included the consortiumâs offer to perform
the EGGS Coating and EGGS Phase 2 optional scopes of work. In August 2004, again after
approval from NAPIMS and NNPC, the Nigeria Joint Venture awarded the EGGS Coating work
to the Willbros Nigeria Consortium. The Willbros Nigeria Consortium, ultimately, did not
obtain the EGGS Phase 2 optional scope of work, despite efforts in late 2004 and early 2005 to
procure it.

22. âIn roughly late 2003, prior to and during the EGGS project bidding process, the
Former President of Willbros International and Steph, acting on behalf of Willbros Group,
plotted with certain employees of Willbros West Africaâs joint venture partner in the Willbros
Nigerian Consortium, to make more than $6 million in payments to Nigerian officials, a Nigerian
political party and an official in the executive branch of Nigeriaâs federal government. These
payments were intended to help the Willbros Nigeria Consortium obtain some or all of the
EGGS business.

23. To implement this scheme, the former President of Willbros International caused
Willbros West Africa to enter into sham âconsultancy agreementsâ with an outside consultant in
Nigeria (âConsultant #1), whose company invoiced Willbros West Africa for purported
âconsultingâ services. The âconsultancy agreementsâ called for the payment, in exchange for
purportedly legitimate consulting services, of 3% of the contract revenue for certain projects,
including the EGGS project. The imvoices were submitted by Jansen and others to the

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-7
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 8 of 25

companyâs administrative office in Houston for payment by wire transfer to a foreign bank, as
directed by the invoices.

24. | The wired money was purportedly for the legitimate consulting services provided
to Willbros affiliates, but, in fact, some or all of that money was intended for corrupt payments.
Steph and Willbros Group, through the conduct of the Former President of Willbros Â©
International, Steph and others, knew that Consultant #1, and others working with him, were
engaged, on behalf of the consortium, in corrupt negotiations with Nigerian officials who had
influence over the EGGS business. They further knew that that Consultant #1, and others
working with him, were using and intended to use some or all of the funds paid, out of a
Willbros Group bank account in Houston, to Consultant #1 to make corrupt payments to
Nigerian officials to cause those officials to award the EGGS project and its optional scopes of
work to the Willbros Nigeria Consortium.

25. | The money disbursed to the Consultant #1 was improperly recorded in Willbros ,
Groupâs books and records as legitimate consulting expenses or other business expenses.
Through this scheme, a portion of these so-called âcommitmentsâ had been paid by late 2004.
Additional âcommitmentsâ of millions of dollars remained to be paid later. These payments
would be funded as the consortium received future EGGS contract revenue, with 3% of that
revenue going to Consultant #1 or those working with him and with subsequent transfer of some
or all of that money to the Nigerian officials.

26. In January 2005, Willbros Group announced that the Former President of
Willbros International had resigned and that the companyâs audit committee had commenced an

internal investigation into allegations of tax improprieties concerning Willbros Transandina, a

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.

Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 9 of 25

subsidiary operating in Bolivia under the management of the Former President of Willbros
International. The internal investigation expanded in scope to include activities in Nigeria.

27. As a result of the companyâs internal investigation, the âconsultingâ agreements
with Consultant #1âs companies were terminated and further payments to Consultant #1 ceased.
During this time, Steph and other Willbros personnel in Nigeria, including former Willbros
employee J.B. Brown (âBrownâ), learned of demands from Nigerian officials for continued
payment of the âcommitmentsâ related to the EGGS project. As a result, they became concerned
that failure to pay the âcommitmentsâ would result in, among other consequences, interference
with Willbros Internationalâs business operations and the potential loss of the EGGS Phase 2
contract (which had not yet been awarded).

28. In or around February 2005, Brown and Steph, in concert with employees of their
joint venture partner, met with a Nigerian consultant (âConsultant #2â) and determined to resume
the payments. At that meeting, Brown and Steph agreed to pay $1,850,000 toward the
outstanding âcommitments.â Because they could no longer generate money by submitting
invoices from Consultant #1âs companies, Steph and others engaged in the scheme sought
alternative sources. They agreed on several potential funding sources: (1) a loan from principals
of a Nigerian oil and gas company (âCompany 1â) to one of Willbrosâs Nigerian subsidiaries; (2)
a loan from the companyâs Willbros Nigeria Consortium partner to one of Willbrosâs Nigerian
subsidiaries; and (3) petty cash from a local account maintained by one of Willbrosâs Nigerian
subsidiaries.

29. Shortly thereafter, Brown, on behalf of Willbros West Africa, agreed to borrow,
pursuant to a written loan agreement, $1 million from the companyâs partner in the Willbros
Nigeria Consortium. He then âloanedâ the money to Consultant #2, for delivery to Nigerian

Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 10 of 25

officials. Steph participated in the plan to fund the âcommitmentsâ and knew of Brownâs
actions.

30. To further help procure the $1,850,000, Steph borrowed, in Nigerian currency, the
equivalent of roughly $500,000 from another individual, working through a Nigerian oil and gas
company. He then delivered that money to Consultant #2 to be transferred to Nigerian officials.

31. âIn February or March 2005, Steph directed that the equivalent of approximately
$350,000 be procured from a Willbros cash account in Nigeria; Steph requested this money to
transfer it to Consultant #2 for delivery to Nigerian officials. This money was accumulated using
fictitious invoices to falsely inflate weekly funding requests transmitted to Willbros Groupâs
Houston administrative headquarters. Once he obtained the $350,000, Steph transferred it to
Consultant #2 for delivery to the Nigerian officials.

32. In or around August 2004, Willbros West Africa executed contracts for an
offshore Nigerian project that involved offshore pipeline work in Nigeria and which the

company expected to generate substantial revenue.

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-10
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 11 of 25

33. As with the scheme associated with the EGGS project described above, Willbros
Group, again through the conduct of the Former President of Willbros International and others,
agreed to make improper payments in excess of $5 million to, among others, officials of NNPC,
NAPIMS, a senior official in the executive branch of the Nigerian federal government, and a
Nigerian political party to assist in obtaining the offshore Nigeria contract business. At least
some of these payments had been made by the end of October 2004.

34. Further, from at least the early 1990âs through 2005, employees of Willbros
Group or its affiliates in Nigeria abused petty cash accounts to, among other things, make
repeated bribes to Nigerian tax and court officials.

35. For example, Willbros Groupâs affiliates, in order to maintain operations in
Nigeria, must pay taxes administered by various Nigerian states, including a Pay-As-You-Earn
(âPAYEâ) tax, based on employee earnings, which Willbros deducts from its workersâ salaries.
In order to reduce this tax obligation, employees of Willbros affiliates bribed auditors
responsible for determining the amount of tax owed.

36. During this same time period, Willbros International employees in Nigeria paid
clerks and other officials within the Nigerian judicial system in exchange for favorable treatment
in pending cases. These payments to court and tax officials were disguised within the companyâs
petty cash processes in Nigeria. Certain employees of Willbros Groupâs subsidiaries
requisitioned excess petty cash funds by submitting fictitious invoices from non-existent
vendors. For example, Jansen and Biggers inflated the cash needed by obtaining fictitious
invoices, typically for fuel, freight or catering expenses, from non-existent vendors. Jansen used
these fictitious invoices to inflate the anticipated expenditures that he projected in weekly
forecasts that he prepared or that were created under his direction. These artificially inflated

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT

Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 12 of 25

reports were used to obtain cash (ultimately over $6 million) from the companyâs offices in
Houston. At least $300,000 of this money was used to make payments to Nigerian tax and court
officials. The Former President of Willbros International knew of these schemes and approved
them, either explicitly or implicitly.

37. As part of this scheme, Jansen routinely approved for payment invoices he knew
were false. He also knowingly submitted false cash requests and forecasts, knowing that those
false reports would generate fund that would at least in part by used to bribe Nigerian court and
tax officials. Biggers knowingly procured invoices he knew to be false and that he knew would
be used to procure funds that would be used to bribe Nigerian court and tax officials. Finally,
Steph knew about this conduct and approved it, both tacitly and on some occasions explicitly.

Bribery Scheme in Ecuador

38. In late 2003, the Former President of Willbros International instructed an
Ecuador-based, individual (âthe Ecuador employeeâ) to pursue business prospects in Ecuador on
behalf of Willbros Group and Willbros Ecuador. During this time period, Brown was helping
supervise the companyâs business in Ecuador. The Ecuador employeeâ telephoned Brown and
informed him that the company could obtain a $3 million contract to modify a pipeline running
from Santo Domingo to El Beaterio, Ecuador (âthe Santa Domingo Projectâ), if the company
would agree to pay $300,000 (10% of the contract value) to certain officials of PetroEcuador, an
oil-and-gas company wholly-owned by the government of Ecuador, and its subsidiary,
PetroComercial (collectively, âPetroEcuadorâ). The scheme called for $150,000 to be paid up
front, with the remaining $150,000 to be paid upon completion of the project. With approval

from the Former President of Willbros International, Brown and the Ecuador employee agreed to

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-12
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 13 of 25

make, on behalf of Willbros Group and its affiliates, the payments. In March 2004 the company
announced that it had received a letter of intent for the Santo Domingo Project.

39. | Between the January and June 2004 time period, the Former President of Willbros
International, on the companyâs behalf, communicated by e-mail and telephone with Brown to
arrange the transfer of $150,000 to employees of Willbros Ecuador so that they could deliver the
money to PetroEcuador officials. One or more of these e-mail communications were sent from |
Brown in South America through Willbros Groupâs server located in Houston, Texas.

40. In June 2004, the Former President of Willbros International directed an outside
consultant to wire $150,000 to the bank account of a second Willbros Ecuador employee, so that
the money could be then be used to make the payments to the PetroEcuador officials. The
Ecaudor employee confirmed to Brown that he had received and would deliver it to the
PetroEcuador officials.

41. While the Santo Domingo Project was underway, the PetroEcuador officials
involved in the scheme were replaced. The former officials, however, insisted on receiving the
second installment, while the newly installed officials also insisted on receiving payments. To
resolve this problem, acting on the approval of the Former President of Willbros International,
Brown attended a meeting at which the Ecuador employee met with both former and current
officials. Brown attended this meeting to ensure that the PetroEcuador officials understood that
the Ecuador employee had the full backing of the company. Ultimately, acting on authorization
from Brown and the Former President of Willbros International, the Ecuador employee brokered
a deal to pay the former officials an additional $90,000 and the new officials $165,000. In return
for this agreement, Willbros would retain the Santo Domingo project and would be awarded a
second project. The money for these payments was transferred to the private bank accounts of

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-13
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 14 of 25

Willbros Ecuador employees and their family members. These disbursements were falsely
recorded in the companyâs books and records as âconsultingâ expenses, âplatform expenses,â or
as âprepaid expenses.â

42. The company ultimately performed the Santa Domingo project, which generated
revenues of roughly 3.4 million dollars. When the bribes pertaining to the second project were
discovered in 2005, the company relinquished the project.

Fraudulent Tax Scheme in Bolivia

43. Willbros conducted business in Bolivia through Willbros Transandina, S.A., a
subsidiary of Willbros International. In late 2001, Willbros Transandina, as part of a joint
venture, was awarded a contract to complete a pipeline in Bolivia. By at least 2002, the Former
President of Willbros International began supervising this project.

44. In Bolivia, Willbros Transandina was required to pay 13% of its receipts to taxing
authorities in satisfaction of what is commonly referred to as a âvalue added taxâ (âVATâ).
Bolivian based companies then add the 13% VAT when they bill their Bolivian customers. If the
VAT a company collects from its customers is greater than the VAT it pays to its vendors, the
company must remit the difference to the taxing authority. In contrast, if a company pays more
than it collects, it does not owe a payment. In short, if a companyâs purchases (and therefore the
VAT paid to its vendors) exceeds the VAT it collects from its own customers, a company can, in
essence, âoffsetâ its VAT payment obligations.

45.  Willbros Group, through the actions of others, including the Former President of
Willbros International and a United States citizen serving as an outside consultant (the âoutside
consultantâ), devised and implemented a scheme to minimize Willbros Transandinaâs VAT
obligation by using fabricated invoices to Bolivian vendors as âoffsets.â This was accomplished

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-14
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 15 of 25

by acquiring invoices that reflected fictitious transactions; these invoices were then used to
support tax returns that fraudulently claimed unearned VAT tax offsets.

46. In many cases, the outside consultant procured the fictitious invoices. Galvez, as
the in-country accountant and administrator for Willbros Transandina, acting under the direction
of the Former President of Willbros International, used the fictitious invoices to further the
scheme by, among other things, preparing false returns and related records.

47. As part of this scheme, the outside consultant submitted invoices for payment by
Willbros Group for purported consulting services. Willbros Group, acting through the Former
President of Willbros International, paid these invoices by wire transfer from Houston to foreign
accounts designated on the invoices. Rather than funding consulting services, however, these
funds were spent, at least in part, to procure the fictitious invoices and to otherwise support the
fraudulent tax minimization strategy. In 2004 alone, Willbros Group paid more than $500,000 to
the outside consultant.

48. As a result of this scheme, the contract costs and the VAT liabilities to the
Bolivian government for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004 were materially understated; the
scheme effectively inflated Willbros Groupâs net income by approximately 6.4% in fiscal year
2003 and inflated earnings per share by approximately $.03 for both fiscal year 2003 and the first
three quarters of 2004.

49. In addition to VAT, the Bolivian government levies an income tax on foreign
companies doing business in Bolivia through a 12.5% withholding tax (âForeign Withholding
Taxâ). Willbros Group, primarily through conduct by the Former President of Willbros
International, materially understated its Foreign Withholding Tax liabilities during fiscal years
2002, 2003, and 2004. Specifically, in 2002, the Former President of Willbros International

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT

Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 16 of 25

directed accounting personnel to reduce the Foreign Withholding Tax liabilities in Willbros
Groupâs books and records for purported tax savings. In 2003 and 2004, again at the direction of
the Former President of Willbros International, accounting personnel eliminated the Foreign
Withholding Tax liabilities from Willbros Groupâs books and records, by reducing the tax
liability account to offset cash disbursements made to the outside consultant and others. In
reality, there was no legitimate tax saving strategy. Instead the funds were merely used to
benefit the purported outside consultant and others. These actions and the resulting false records
caused the tax liability to be understated. As a result, for fiscal year 2003, these understatements
caused Willbros Groupâs net income to be inflated by approximately 6.4%.

50. During 2003 and 2004, Willbros Group offered and sold securities pursuant to
registration statements on Form S-8 and filed resale shelf registration statements on Form S-3.
These registration statements incorporated by reference the companyâs periodic filings that
contained the material misrepresentations discussed in the paragraphs above.

SEC Charges Willbros Group and Former Employees with
Foreign Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2008-86

Washington, D.C., May 14, 2008 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed a settled enforcement action charging Willbros Group, Inc. and
four former employees with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA), alleging that they paid more than $6 million in undisclosed bribes to
Nigerian government officials and others to obtain significant contracts for the
Houston-based company.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release
Â®Â» SEC Complaint

 

Willbros Group has agreed to pay $10.3 million to settle the SECâs charges,
and the four other defendants also agreed to settle the charges against them
without admitting or denying the allegations. The SECâs complaint names
Jason Steph, a former supervisory employee in Nigeria; Gerald Jansen, a
former administrative supervisor in Nigeria; Lloyd Biggers, a former employee
in Nigeria; and Carlos Galvez, a former accounting employee in Bolivia.

âThis case demonstrates the Commissionâs continued vigorous enforcement
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Rose Romero, Regional Director of
the SECâs Fort Worth Regional Office. âWe will not allow companies to use
illicit payments to alter the competitive balance of the marketplace, as
alleged here.â

The anti-bribery provisions of FCPA prohibit corrupt payments to foreign
officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, and the
corresponding accounting provisions in the federal securities laws require
adequate disclosure of payments.

The SEC alleges that, beginning in at least 2003, Willbros Group engaged ina
scheme to pay more than $6 million in undisclosed bribes to Nigerian
government officials and employees of an operator of a joint venture majority-
owned by the Nigerian government in order to obtain two significant contracts
that resulted in net profits of nearly $9 million. The SECâs complaint further
alleges that Willbros Group and former employees used fabricated invoices to
obtain cash from the companyâs Houston headquarters to bribe Nigerian tax
and court officials.

The SECâs complaint also alleges that Willbros Group and employees schemed
to pay a $300,000 bribe to officials of an oil-and-gas company owned by the
Ecuador government in order to obtain a $3 million contract, and
implemented a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme in Bolivia that resulted in
material misstatements in Willbros Groupâs financial statements.

The SEC alleges that Willbros Group violated Sections 30A, 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)
(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1
and 13a-13 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. Willbros
Group has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future
violations of these provisions and an order to pay $8.9 million disgorgement,
plus $1.4 million in prejudgment interest.

The SEC alleges that Stephâs actions in Nigeria violated Sections 30A and
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and
abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the
Exchange Act. Steph consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from
future violations of these provisions. Pursuant to the judgment, the court will
determine later whether Steph will pay a penalty.

The SEC alleges that Jansenâs role in the Nigerian bribes violated Section
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and
abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the
Exchange Act. He has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from
future violations of these provisions and to an order to pay a $30,000 civil
penalty.

The SEC alleges that the conduct of Biggers in Nigeria violated Section 13(b)
(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 30A of the Exchange Act. He has
consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of
these provisions.

The SEC alleges that the conduct of Galvez in Bolivia violated Section 13(b)(5)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted
violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Galvez
has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of
these provisions and an order to pay a $35,000 civil penalty.

The Commission acknowledges Willbros Group's cooperation in the
investigation.

In a related criminal proceeding, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a
criminal Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement in the Southern
District of Texas relating to the criminal FCPA charges against Willbros Group
and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc. (Willbros International). In that
case, Willbros Group and Willbros International accepted responsibility for its
employees that had violated the FCPA and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of
$22 million. Pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the Department
of Justice agreed to defer prosecution of these companies for three years and
the companies agreed to retain for a period of three years an independent
compliance monitor to assess the companyâs implementation of and
compliance with new internal policies and procedures. If Willbros Group and
Willbros International abide by the terms of the agreement, the Department
will dismiss the Information when the term of the agreement ends.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in this
investigation.

Â§ Civil Action No.: 4:09-399
VS. Â§

Â§ COMPLAINT

HALLIBURTON COMPANY Â§
Â§
and Â§
Â§
KBR, INC., Â§
Â§
Defendants. Â§
Â§

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ) alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (the âFCPAââ) of the federal securities laws by Defendants Halliburton
Company and KBR, Inc.

2. In September 1998, Halliburton Company (âHalliburtonââ) acquired
Dresser Industries, Inc. (âDresserâ), including Dresserâs subsidiary, The M.W. Kellogg
Company (âKelloggâ). After the acquisition, Kellogg was combined with Halliburtonâs
subsidiary, Brown & Root, Inc., to form Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc., which later
became Kellogg, Brown & Root, LLC, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of KBR, Inc.
KBR, Inc., its subsidiaries and predecessor entities, including Kellogg, will be referred to

as âKBRâ throughout this Complaint.
3. Between at least 1995 and 2004, senior executives at KBR and others,
devised and implemented a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to assist in
obtaining multiple contracts worth over $6 billion to build liquefied natural gas (âLNGââ)
production facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria. A four-company joint venture, of which
KBR was a member, won the contracts. To conceal the illicit payments, KBR and others,
through the joint venture, entered into sham âconsultingâ or âservicesâ agreements with
intermediaries who would then funnel their purportedly legitimate fees to Nigerian
officials. Specifically, KBR and others, through the joint venture, implemented this
scheme by using a Gibraltar shell company controlled by a solicitor based in the United
Kingdom (âthe UK Agentâ) and a Japanese trading company (âthe Japanese Agentâ) as
conduits for the bribes.

4. After its acquisition of Dresser, Halliburton, KBRâs parent corporation,
failed to devise adequate internal controls relating to foreign sales agents and the FCPA,
and failed to maintain and enforce those internal controls it had. Halliburton therefore
failed to detect, deter or prevent KBRâs violations. As a result of the scheme, numerous
books and records of Halliburton and KBR contained false information relating to,
among other things, the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent, and the payments made to
them.

5. The Commission brings this action against the Defendants seeking
permanent injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the federal securities laws, and

seeking their ill-gotten gains.
JURISDICTION

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),
21(e) and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C.

SÂ§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa].

7. Halliburton and KBR, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails and of
the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the acts,
practices and courses of business described in this Complaint.

DEFENDANTS

8. Halliburton is a Delaware energy services corporation, headquartered in
Houston, Texas and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Its common stock is registered under
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Before
Halliburton acquired Dresser in 1998, Dresserâs common stock was registered under
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.

9. KBR, Inc. is a Delaware engineering, construction and government
services corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas. KBR, Inc. was formed in March
2006 and was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Halliburton until November 2006, when it
became a separate publicly-traded company. KBR, Inc.âs common stock is registered
under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York Stock Exchange.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

KBR and Others Agree to Pay
Bribes to Obtain Nigeria LNG Contract

10. In the late 1980s, the Nigerian government created Nigeria LNG, Ltd.
(âNigeria LNGââ) to capture and sell the natural gas associated with oil production in

Nigeria. Nigeria LNG is an entity and instrumentality of the Nigerian government. At
all relevant times, the Nigerian government owned 49% or more of Nigeria LNG and,
through the directors that it appointed to the Board of Directors of Nigeria LNG, the
Nigerian government exercised control over the company. Three multinational
companies own the remainder of Nigeria LNG. Nigerian employees of Nigeria LNG are
detailed from the Nigerian Ministry of Petroleum Resources or the government-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. (âNNPCââ). In the early 1990s, Nigeria LNG invited
bids to construct two LNG âtrainsâ on Bonny Island, Nigeria, estimated to be worth $1.8
billion. An LNG train is a facility to convert raw natural gas into pure LNG, ready for
delivery to a tanker.

11. In 1991, in order to pursue LNG projects in Nigeria, KBR predecessor
Kellogg formed a joint venture with three other multinational engineering and
construction companies. The joint venture began to pursue bidding on a construction
contract for Nigeria LNG to build two LNG trains in Nigeria.

12. Officers and employees at the highest level of KBR, including its former
CEO, Albert Jackson Stanley (âStanleyâ), were closely involved in the joint venture and
its business in Nigeria from the joint ventureâs inception. Each member of the joint
venture had one or more representatives on a steering committee that ran the joint
venture. Stanley was a member of that steering committee at all relevant times. Other
high ranking personnel of KBR were also closely involved in the joint venture; these
included sales, legal and operational personnel.

13. From the inception of the joint venture, the sales officials and other senior
personnel of the four joint venture members believed that it was necessary to pay bribes

to Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining the LNG construction contracts. In
conjunction with the Japanese Agent, the sales officials of the joint venture formed what
they called the âcultural committeeâ to consider how to implement, but hide, the scheme
to pay bribes. The committee members discussed: (1) entering into sham consulting
contracts with various individuals or shell corporations; (41) âdownloadingâ or
âoffloadingâ the payments through subcontractors or vendors; and (iii) entering into
phony âservicesâ contracts with the Japanese Agent. Ostensibly, the consultants or
vendors would be retained and paid to perform legitimate services. In actuality, the
consultants or vendors would use the money in whole or in part to make corrupt
payments to Nigerian government officials on behalf of the joint venture.

14. Eventually, the joint venture decided to funnel the payments through two
entities, using the UK Agent to pay high-ranking Nigerian officials, and using the
Japanese Agent to pay lower-level Nigerian officials. These agents were sometimes
referred to as âCultural Advisors.â The joint venture steering committee approved the
use of the two agents, and the steering committee approved the contracts eventually
entered into between the joint venture and the two agents.

15. In pursuing the bidding with Nigeria LNG, in holding meetings of the
steering committee and the cultural committee, in carrying out the construction contracts,
and in all related matters, KBR and the other members of the joint venture routinely made
use of the U.S. mails, and of U.S. common carriers, and of other instrumentalities of U.S.
interstate commerce. Payments made by the joint venture to the bank accounts of the UK

Agent were routed through banks in New York, New York.
The UK Agent

Trains One and Two

 

16. Prior to joining the joint venture, KBR predecessor Kellogg had used the
UK Agent on government construction projects in Nigeria. On its recommendation, the
joint venture decided to use the UK Agent for Trains One and Two. Before the joint
venture entered into a written contract with the UK Agent, Stanley met with high-ranking
Nigerian government officials in November 1994 to discuss the possible use of the UK
Agent. The officials assured Stanley that the UK Agent was the right conduit.
Thereafter, in March 1995, the joint venture entered into an agreement to pay the UK
Agent $60 million, with the understanding that a substantial portion of this money would
be funneled to Nigerian officials as bribes.

17. In December 1995, Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture the contract to
build the first two LNG Trains, for $2.2 billion. The joint venture began construction in
1996 and finished in 2000. As the joint venture received payments for the construction
from Nigeria LNG, it paid the UK Agent. The joint venture sent a total of $60 million to
the UK Agentâs Swiss bank account between December 1995 and March 2000 for use in
making corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials.

18. As the UK Agent received these payments, the UK Agent made systematic
and substantial transfers of money to accounts owned or controlled by one or more high-

ranking Nigerian government officials.
Train Three

19. In 1996, the joint venture began pursuing a contract with Nigeria LNG to
build Train Three on Bonny Island, Nigeria. In May 1997, Stanley and others in the joint
venture traveled to Nigeria to meet with high-ranking Nigerian government officials to
confirm that the UK Agent was still the correct intermediary to use to pay bribes.

20. In February 1999, following a change in government, Stanley and others
in the joint venture again traveled to Nigeria to meet a high-ranking Nigerian government
official who confirmed that the UK Agent was the correct intermediary. The Nigerian
official also appointed his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount. In March
1999, Stanley and others in the joint venture met with the Nigerian officialâs
representative in London to negotiate the amount of the bribes to be paid in connection
with the award of the Train Three LNG contract. Stanley and others agreed to pay $32.5
million through the UK Agent.

21. Days after the London meeting, Nigeria LNG awarded the Train Three
contract to the joint venture for $1.2 billion. The joint venture then entered into a new
agreement with the UK Agent for the $32.5 million negotiated at the London meeting.
Between March 1999 and May 2003, the joint venture paid the UK Agent, directing the
payments to the UK Agentâs bank accounts in Switzerland and Monaco. After receiving
the money, the UK Agent made substantial payments to accounts controlled by one or
more high-ranking Nigerian government officials.

Trains Four and Five

 

22. In approximately 2001, the joint venture discussed the award of the next

series of LNG Trains. In November 2001, Stanley and others in the joint venture again
traveled to Nigeria to meet a high-ranking government official, who confirmed that the
UK Agent was still acceptable to serve as a conduit for the payments and who appointed
his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount.

23. In December 2001, the joint venture entered into another agreement with
the UK Agent in connection with Trains Four and Five for $51 million. In March 2002,
Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture a $1.6 billion contract to build Trains Four and
Five. Between March 2002 and January 2004, the joint venture paid the UK Agent
$40 million under the sham consulting agreement. After receiving the money, the UK
Agent made substantial transfers of money to one or more high-ranking Nigerian
government officials.

24. In one instance, the UK Agent used a subcontractor on the Nigeria LNG
project (the âSubcontractorââ) to transfer $5 million to a Nigerian government official for
the benefit of a Nigerian political party. The Subcontractor official, the UK Agent and
the Nigerian government official met in London in June 2002 to discuss the terms of the
transfer.

25. Beginning in August 2002, the UK Agent wire transferred $5 million from
money received from the joint venture to a bank account of the Subcontractor in the U.K.
The Subcontractor then transferred this money to a bank account in Nigeria. Thereafter,
as the money came in, the Subcontractor withdrew cash in U.S. dollars or in local
currency and delivered the money to the Nigerian official.

26. On several occasions, the Subcontractor personally hand-delivered
$1 million in U.S. currency in a brief case to the Nigerian official in a hotel room in

Abuja, Nigeria. The Subcontractor delivered the remainder of the $5 million to the
Nigerian official in local Nigerian currency, the Naira. Because the Naira was too bulky
to deliver by hand, the Subcontractor loaded the cash into vehicles, which were delivered
to the Nigerian official.

The Japanese Agent

27. As alleged above, Stanley and others in the joint venture agreed to use the
Japanese Agent to make corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian government officials
in connection with the Bonny Island LNG Trains.

28. Between 1996 and 2002, the joint venture entered into three âservicesâ
agreements with the Japanese Agent. Stanley and others authorized and directed the joint
venture to enter into each of the agreements with the Japanese Agent intending and
expecting that the Japanese Agent would use money it received under these agreements
to offer and make corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian officials to assist in obtaining
the LNG contracts to build Trains One through Five.

29. Between 1996 and June 2004, when the payments ended, the joint venture
paid the Japanese Agent more than $50 million.

Halliburtonâs Internal Controls Failed to Detect, Deter or Prevent Bribery

30. Halliburton exercised control and supervision over its business units,
including, after its acquisition of Dresser, KBR. During the relevant period, KBRâs
board of directors consisted solely of senior Halliburton officials. Halliburton senior
officers hired and replaced KBRâs senior officials, determined salaries and set
performance goals. After its acquisition of Dresser, Halliburton consolidated KBRâs
financial statements into its own, and all of KBRâs profits flowed directly to Halliburton

and were reported to investors as Halliburtonâs profits. Stanley discussed the Nigeria
LNG project with Halliburtonâs senior officials, who were aware of the joint ventureâs
use of the UK Agent on the Nigeria LNG project. Stanley and others did not tell the
Halliburton officials that the UK Agent would use the money to pay bribes. Stanley
received approval from Halliburton to proceed with the Train Three project.

31. After it acquired Dresser in September 1998 and formed KBR,
Halliburtonâs policies and procedures governed KBRâs use of agents. Halliburtonâs
Legal Department conducted a due diligence investigation of the UK Agent prior to the
award by Nigeria LNG of the contract for Train Three. Halliburtonâs policies required
that the investigation be âreasonable under the circumstances,â and required that a
number of factors be considered, including the âreasonableness of the feesâ and the
âbusiness and cultural environmentâ in which the agent would be operating. The policies
did not require, however, any specific description of the agentâs duties, or that the agent
agree to any accounting or audit of fees received, nor did the policies specify what steps
needed to be taken in conducting the investigation.

32. The KBR and Halliburton attorneys who conducted the due diligence
investigation in 1998 learned that the shares of the Gibraltar shell company were held by
entities called ââTower Nominees Ltd.â and âT&T Nominees, Ltd.â The attorneys never
learned the identity of the beneficial owner[s] of the shares. The attorneys did learn that
the only active official of the Gibraltar shell company was the solicitor based in the
United Kingdom. The attorneys did not seek to determine how the UK Agent would or
could carry out his duties under the consulting contract from the United Kingdom, or how

he was carrying out his duties under the existing $60 million contract for Trains One and

10
Two. In addition, the attorneys did not check all of the references provided by the UK
Agent, some of which were in fact false.

33. A now-retired Senior Halliburton legal officer reviewed the due diligence
conducted by the Halliburton attorneys and knew that the investigation had failed to learn
significant information. Nevertheless, Halliburton approved the use of the UK Agent.

34. Halliburton also failed to conduct appropriate due diligence when the joint
venture entered into new contracts with the UK Agent. Instead of following its policies,
Halliburton conducted minimal follow-up due diligence as to the UK Agent before the
joint venture entered into the contract for Trains Four and Five.

35. At the time that Nigeria LNG awarded the contract for Trains Four and
Five, Halliburton required that a form called âB-2 Agent Approval Requestâ be prepared
for any agent contract. This document needed to be signed by senior Halliburton officials
before the agent contract was entered into. Senior KBR officials prepared a form B-2 for
the proposed UK Agent contract. The document contained false statements as to, among
other things, the UK Agentâs place of business (falsely stated to be Monaco) and number
of employees (falsely stated to be four). The document was signed for approval by senior
Halliburton officials for finance and administration, as well as senior KBR officials.
None of the senior Halliburton or KBR officials who signed the document undertook any
independent review or asked any questions concerning the UK Agent.

36. Halliburton conducted no due diligence as to the Japanese Agent. By
characterizing the relationship between the joint venture and the Japanese Agent as a
âservicesâ contract, senior KBR officials, acting through the joint venture, effectively hid

the true nature of the relationship. Halliburtonâs policies, procedures and internal

11
controls had no mechanism by which to test the characterization of contracts entered into
by its business units or by joint ventures in which it participated.
Documents at KBR and Halliburton Contained False Information

37. In numerous KBR, Dresser and Halliburton company records, the
payments to the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent were falsely characterized as
legitimate âconsultingâ or âservicesâ fees when, in fact, they were bribes. KBRâs books
and records containing the false information were incorporated and reflected in
Halliburtonâs corporate books and records. For example, the contracts with the UK
Agent and the Japanese Agent falsely described the purpose of the contracts in order to
make it appear that the agents would perform legitimate services. Internal company bid
documents for the LNG Trains mischaracterized the bribe payments as legitimate
expenses. In addition, certain false information was used in the companiesâ due diligence
process for approving use of the UK Agent.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

KBR Violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act
(Anti-Bribery Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)

38. Paragraphs | through 37 are realleged and incorporated herein by
reference.

39. As described above, KBR, an agent of Halliburton, a U.S. issuer, acting on
Halliburtonâs behalf, made use of the mails or other means or instrumentality of interstate
commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization
of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the

giving of anything of value, to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing their acts

12
or decisions, securing an improper advantage, or inducing them to use their influence, to
assist the issuer in obtaining or retaining business.

AO. In addition, KBR at all relevant times was a U.S. person as that term is
defined in Section 30A(g)(2) of the Exchange Act, and was an agent of a U.S. issuer
acting on behalf of the issuer. KBR corruptly committed acts outside the United States in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any
money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value,
to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing their acts or decisions, securing an
improper advantage, or inducing them to use their influence, to assist the issuer in
obtaining or retaining business.

41. By reason of the foregoing, KBR violated, and unless restrained and
enjoined will continue to violate, Section 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

Halliburton Violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) & 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act
(Company Records and Internal Controls)

42. Paragraphs | through 41 above are realleged and incorporated by

internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions

are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with

13
generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and to maintain accountability for such assets.

45, By reason of the foregoing, Halliburton violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) & (B)].

THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF
KBR Aided and Abetted Halliburtonâs Violations
of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) & 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act
(Company Records and Internal Controls)

46. Paragraphs | through 45 above are realleged and incorporated by
reference herein.

47. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires companies to keep
accurate books, records and accounts which reflect fairly the transactions entered into by
companies and the disposition of its assets. KBR knowingly or recklessly substantially
assisted Halliburtonâs violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.

A8. Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires companies to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and to maintain accountability for such assets. KBR knowingly or recklessly
substantially assisted Halliburtonâs violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange
Act.

49. By reason of the foregoing, KBR aided and abetted Halliburtonâs
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.

Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) & (B)].

14
FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF
KBR Violated of Section 13(b)()
of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1
(Company Records and Internal Controls)

50. Paragraphs | through 49 above are realleged and incorporated by
reference herein.

51. As described above, during the relevant period KBR knowingly falsified,
and directly or indirectly, caused to be falsified books, records, or accounts of
Halliburton, a U.S. issuer, subject to Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.
Â§ 78m(b)(2)]. As a result of KBRâs conduct, the books and records of Halliburton falsely
reflected the payments to the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent as legitimate business
expenses instead of bribes. By falsifying documents and authorizing the sham agent
contracts, KBR also knowingly circumvented certain internal accounting controls of
Halliburton.

52. By reason of the foregoing, KBR violated Section 13(b)(5) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(5)] and Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1].

SEC Charges KBR and Halliburton for FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2009-23

Washington, D.C., Feb. 11, 2009 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced settlements with KBR, Inc. and Halliburton Co. to resolve
SEC charges that KBR subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root LLC bribed Nigerian
government officials over a 10-year period, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA), in order to obtain construction contracts. The SEC also
charged that KBR and Halliburton, KBR's former parent company, engaged in
books and records violations and internal controls violations related to the
bribery.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 20897A
Â®Â» SEC Complaint

 

KBR and Halliburton have agreed to pay $177 million in disgorgement to
settle the SEC's charges. Kellogg Brown & Root LLC has agreed to pay a $402
million fine to settle parallel criminal charges brought today by the U.S.
Department of Justice. The sanctions represent the largest combined
settlement ever paid by U.S. companies since the FCPA's inception.

""FCPA violations have been and will continue to be dealt with severely by the
SEC and other law enforcement agencies,"" said SEC Chairman Mary L.
Schapiro. ""Any company that seeks to put greed ahead of the law by making
illegal payments to win business should beware that we are working
vigorously across borders to detect and punish such illicit conduct.""

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said,
""This case demonstrates the close and cooperative working relationships that
have developed in FCPA investigations among the SEC, the U.S. Department
of Justice, and foreign law enforcement agencies and securities regulators.""

Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement,
added, ""The SEC will not tolerate violations of the FCPA, regardless of the
lengths to which public companies will go to structure their corrupt
transactions to avoid detection. Multi-national companies should take heed
that attempting to conceal bribes by funneling them through intermediaries
or offshore entities will not be successful.""

Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division at
the Department of Justice said, ""Today's guilty plea by KBR ends one chapter
in the Department's long-running investigation of corruption in the award of
$6 billion in construction contracts in Nigeria. This bribery scheme involved
both senior foreign government officials and KBR corporate executives who
took actions to insulate themselves from the reach of U.S. law enforcement.
The successful prosecution of KBR, and its agreement to pay a more than
$400 million fine, demonstrates that no one is above the law, and that the
Department is determined to seek penalties that are commensurate with, and
will deter, this kind of serious criminal misconduct.""

Kellogg Brown & Root LLC's predecessor entities (Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc.
and The M.W. Kellogg Company) were members of a four-company joint
venture that won the construction contracts worth more than $6 billion. In
September 1998, Halliburton acquired Dresser Industries, Inc., the parent
company of The M.W. Kellogg Company.

The SEC alleges that beginning as early as 1994, members of the joint
venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to officials within the
Nigerian government in order to obtain the construction contracts. The former
CEO of the predecessor entities, Albert ""Jack"" Stanley, and others involved in
the joint venture met with high-ranking Nigerian government officials and
their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe
payments. To conceal the illicit payments, the joint venture entered into sham
contracts with two agents, one based in the United Kingdom and one based in
Japan, to funnel money to Nigerian officials.

The SEC's complaint alleges that the internal controls of Halliburton, the
parent company of the KBR predecessor entities from 1998 to 2006, failed to
detect or prevent the bribery, and that Halliburton records were falsified as a
result of the bribery scheme. In September 2008, Stanley pleaded guilty to
bribery and related charges and entered into a settlement with the SEC.

The SEC alleges that officials of the joint venture formed a ""cultural
committee"" to decide how to carry out the bribery scheme. The committee
decided to use the United Kingdom agent to make payments to high-ranking
Nigerian officials and to use the Japanese agent to make payments to lower-
ranking Nigerian officials. As the joint venture was paid for work on the
construction project, the joint venture in turn made payments to the Japanese
agent and to the Swiss and Monaco bank accounts of the United Kingdom
agent. The total payments to the two agents exceeded $180 million. After
receiving the money, the United Kingdom agent made substantial payments
to accounts controlled by Nigerian government officials, and beginning in
2002 paid $5 million in cash to a Nigerian political party.

The SEC's complaint further alleges that, after the Dresser acquisition,
Halliburton failed to devise and maintain adequate internal controls to govern
the use of foreign sales agents and failed to maintain and enforce the internal
controls it had. Halliburton's due diligence investigation of the United
Kingdom agent failed to detect or prevent the bribery scheme. Halliburton
conducted no due diligence on the Japanese agent. As a result of the scheme,
numerous Halliburton records contained false information relating to the
payments to the agents.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, KBR and Halliburton have
consented to the entry of a court order that (i) permanently enjoins KBR from
violating the anti-bribery and records falsification provisions in Sections 30A,
13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and from
aiding and abetting violations of the record-keeping and internal control
provisions in Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; (ii)
permanently enjoins Halliburton from violating the record-keeping and
internal control provisions of the Exchange Act; (iii) orders the companies to
disgorge $177 million in ill-gotten profits derived from the scheme; (iv)
imposes an independent monitor for KBR for a period of three years to review
its FCPA compliance program, and (v) imposes an independent consultant for
Halliburton to review its policies and procedures as they relate to compliance
with the FCPA. The proposed settlements are subject to the court's approval.

In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed a criminal action against Kellogg Brown & Root LLC, charging one
count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and four counts of violating the anti-
bribery provisions of the FCPA. Kellogg Brown & Root LLC has pled guilty to
each of these counts. Under its plea agreement, Kellogg Brown & Root LLC is
required to pay a criminal fine of $402 million and to retain a monitor to
review and evaluate KBR's policies and procedures as they relate to
compliance with the FCPA.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of
Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and foreign
authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. The Commission's
investigation is continuing.

Plaintiff, Â§

Â§ Civil Action No. |
Vs. Â§

Â§ COMPLAINT

TECHNIP, Â§
Â§
Defendant. Â§
Â§

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ) alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(the âFCPAââ) of the federal securities laws by Defendant Technip (âTechnipâ or âDefendantâ).

2. Between at least 1995 and 2004, senior executives at Technip, among others,
devised and implemented a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining
multiple contracts worth over $6 billion to build liquefied natural gas (âLNGââ) production
facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria. A four-company joint venture called âTSKJ,â of which
Technip was a member, won the contracts. To conceal the illicit payments, Technip and others,
through the joint venture, entered into sham âconsultingâ or âservicesâ agreements with
intermediaries who would then funnel their purportedly legitimate fees to Nigerian officials.
Specifically, Technip, through the joint venture, implemented this scheme by using a Gibraltar
shell company controlled by a solicitor based in the United Kingdom (âthe UK Agentâ) and a

Japanese trading company (âthe Japanese Agentâ) as conduits for the bribes.
3. As a result of the scheme, numerous books and records of Technip contained false
information relating to, among other things, the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent, and the
payments made to them.

4. Technip was a U.S. issuer between August 30, 2001 and November 14, 2007.
Technip registered securities with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 781(b)].

5. Technip was a member of the TSKJ joint venture and engaged in illegal bribery
from at least 1995 through June 2004. The Commission brings this action against the Defendant
seeking permanent injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the federal securities laws, and
seeking its ill-gotten gains.

JURISDICTION

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa].

7. Technip, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails and of the means and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the acts, practices and courses of
business described in this Complaint.

DEFENDANT

8. Technip is a French corporation, headquartered in Paris, France. American

Depository Shares, representing ordinary shares of Technip, were registered with and listed on

the New York Stock Exchange.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Technip Agrees to Pay Bribes to Obtain Nigeria LNG Contract

9. In the late 1980s, the Nigerian government created Nigeria LNG, Ltd. (âNigeria
LNGâ) to capture and sell the natural gas associated with oil production in Nigeria. Nigeria
LNG is an entity and instrumentality of the Nigerian government. At all relevant times, the
Nigerian government owned 49% or more of Nigeria LNG and, through the directors that it
appointed to the Board of Directors of Nigeria LNG, the Nigerian government exercised control
over the company. Three multinational companies own the remainder of Nigeria LNG. Nigerian
employees of Nigeria LNG are detailed from the Nigerian Ministry of Petroleum Resources or
the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. (âNNPCââ). In the early 1990s,
Nigeria LNG invited bids to construct two LNG âtrainsâ on Bonny Island, Nigeria, estimated to
be worth $1.8 billion. An LNG train is a facility to convert raw natural gas into pure LNG, ready
for delivery to a tanker.

10. In 1990, in order to pursue LNG projects in Nigeria, Technip formed a joint
venture with three other multinational engineering and construction companies. The joint
venture began to pursue bidding on a construction contract for Nigeria LNG to build two LNG
trains in Nigeria. The joint venture operated through entities incorporated in Madeira, Portugal.

11. Executives and employees at the highest level of Technip were closely involved
in the joint venture and its business in Nigeria from the joint ventureâs inception. Each member
of the joint venture had one or more representatives on a steering committee that ran the joint
venture.

12. From the inception of the joint venture, the sales executives and other senior

personnel of the four joint venture members believed that it was necessary to pay bribes to
Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining the LNG construction contracts. In
conjunction with the Japanese Agent, the sales executives of the joint venture companies formed
what they called the âcultural committeeâ to consider how to implement, but hide, the scheme to
pay bribes. The committee members discussed: (i) entering into sham consulting contracts with
various individuals or shell corporations; (11) âdownloadingâ or âoffloadingâ the payments
through subcontractors or vendors; and (111) entering into phony âservicesâ contracts with the
Japanese Agent. Ostensibly, the consultants or vendors would be retained and paid to perform
legitimate services. In actuality, the consultants or vendors would use the money in whole or in
part to make corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials on behalf of the joint venture.

13. Eventually, the joint venture decided to funnel the payments through two entities,
using the UK Agent to pay high-ranking Nigerian officials, and using the Japanese Agent to pay
lower-level Nigerian officials. These agents were sometimes referred to as âCultural Advisors.â
The joint venture steering committee approved the use of the two agents, and the steering
committee approved the contracts eventually entered into between the joint venture and the two
agents.

14. In pursuing the bidding with Nigeria LNG, in holding meetings of the steering
committee and the cultural committee, in carrying out the construction contracts, and in all
related matters, Technip and the other members of the joint venture routinely made use of the
U.S. mails, and of U.S. common carriers, and of other instrumentalities of U.S. interstate
commerce. Payments made by the joint venture to the bank accounts of the UK Agent were

routed through banks in New York, New York.
The UK Agent

Trains One and Two

15. The joint venture decided to use the UK Agent for Trains One and Two. Before
the joint venture entered into a written contract with the UK Agent, executives from Technip and
other representatives of the joint venture traveled to Nigeria to meet with high-ranking Nigerian
government officials in November 1994 to discuss the possible use of the UK Agent. The
officials confirmed that the UK Agent was the right conduit. Thereafter, in March 1995, the
joint venture entered into an agreement to pay the UK Agent $60 million, with the understanding
that a substantial portion of this money would be funneled to Nigerian officials as bribes.

16. In December 1995, Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture the contract to build
the first two LNG Trains, for $2.2 billion. The joint venture began construction in 1996 and
finished in 2000. As the joint venture received payments for the construction from Nigeria LNG,
it paid the UK Agent. The joint venture sent a total of $60 million to the UK Agentâs Swiss bank
account between December 1995 and March 2000 for use in making corrupt payments to
Nigerian government officials.

17. As the UK Agent received these payments, the UK Agent made systematic and
substantial transfers of money to accounts owned or controlled by one or more high-ranking
Nigerian government officials.

Train Three

18. In 1996, the joint venture began pursuing a contract with Nigeria LNG to build

Train Three on Bonny Island, Nigeria. In May 1997, at least one senior executive from Technip,

along with others in the joint venture, traveled to Nigeria to meet with high-ranking Nigerian
government officials to confirm that the UK Agent was still the correct intermediary to use to
pay bribes.

19. In February 1999, following a change in government, an executive from Technip
and others from the joint venture, traveled to Nigeria to meet a high-ranking Nigerian
government official who confirmed that the UK Agent was the correct intermediary. The
Nigerian official also appointed his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount. In March
1999, an executive from Technip and others from the joint venture met with the Nigerian
officialâs representative in London to negotiate the amount of the bribes to be paid in connection
with the award of the Train Three LNG contract. Technip, along with the other joint venture
partners, agreed to pay $32.5 million through the UK Agent.

20. Days after the London meeting, Nigeria LNG awarded the Train Three contract to
the joint venture for $1.2 billion. The joint venture then entered into a new agreement with the
UK Agent for the $32.5 million negotiated at the London meeting. Between March 1999 and
May 2003, the joint venture paid the UK Agent, directing the payments to the UK Agentâs bank
accounts in Switzerland and Monaco. After receiving the money, the UK Agent made
substantial payments to accounts controlled by one or more high-ranking Nigerian government
officials.

Trains Four and Five

21. In approximately 2001, the joint venture discussed the award of the next series of
LNG Trains. In November 2001, a joint venture representative and others traveled to Nigeria to
meet a high-ranking government official, who confirmed that the UK Agent was still acceptable
to serve as a conduit for the payments and who appointed his own representative to negotiate the

bribe amount.
22. In December 2001, the joint venture entered into another agreement with the UK
Agent in connection with Trains Four and Five for $51 million. In March 2002, Nigeria LNG
awarded the joint venture a $1.6 billion contract to build Trains Four and Five. Between March
2002 and January 2004, the joint venture paid the UK Agent $40 million under the sham
consulting agreement. After receiving the money, the UK Agent made substantial transfers of
money to one or more high-ranking Nigerian government officials.

23. In one instance, the UK Agent used a subcontractor on the Nigeria LNG project
(the âSubcontractorâ) to transfer $5 million to a Nigerian government official for the benefit of a
Nigerian political party. The Subcontractor official, the UK Agent and the Nigerian government
official met in London in June 2002 to discuss the terms of the transfer.

24. Beginning in August 2002, the UK Agent wire transferred $5 million from money
received from the joint venture to a bank account of the Subcontractor in the U.K. The
Subcontractor then transferred this money to a bank account in Nigeria. Thereafter, as the
money came in, the Subcontractor withdrew cash in U.S. dollars or in local currency and
delivered the money to the Nigerian official.

25. On several occasions, the Subcontractor personally hand-delivered $1 million in
U.S. currency in a brief case to the Nigerian official in a hotel room in Abuja, Nigeria. The
Subcontractor delivered the remainder of the $5 million to the Nigerian official in local Nigerian
currency, the Naira. Because the Naira was too bulky to deliver by hand, the Subcontractor

loaded the cash into vehicles, which were delivered to the Nigerian official.
The Japanese Agent

26. As alleged above, Technip and others in the joint venture agreed to use the
Japanese Agent to make corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian government officials in
connection with the Bonny Island LNG Trains.

27. Between 1996 and 2002, the joint venture entered into three âservicesâ
agreements with the Japanese Agent. Technip and others authorized and directed the joint
venture to enter into each of the agreements with the Japanese Agent intending and expecting
that the Japanese Agent would use money it received under these agreements to offer and make
corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian officials to assist in obtaining the LNG contracts to
build Trains One through Five.

28. Between 1996 and June 2004, when the payments ended, the joint venture paid
the Japanese Agent more than $50 million.

Documents at Technip Contained False Information

29. In numerous joint venture company records, the payments to the UK Agent and
the Japanese Agent were falsely characterized as legitimate âconsultingâ or âservicesâ fees
when, in fact, they were bribes. The contracts with the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent falsely
described the purpose of the contracts in order to make it appear that the agents would perform
legitimate services. Senior executives of Technip maintained the joint venture records as part of
Technipâs company records.

Internal Controls at Technip Failed to Detect, Deter or Prevent Bribery

30. Technip conducted due diligence on the UK Agent that was not adequate to

detect, deter or prevent the UK Agent from paying bribes, and Technip conducted no due

diligence on the Japanese Agent.
31. After Technip became a U.S. issuer in August 2001, it became subject to the
FCPA, including the Actâs prohibitions on the payment of anything of value to foreign
government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Although the executives of
Technip who participated in the joint venture were aware of these prohibitions, Technip did not
implement adequate controls to ensure compliance with the Act. For example, Technip did not
adopt due diligence procedures as to agents that were adequate to detect, deter or prevent the
payment of bribes by agents. The due diligence procedures adopted by Technip only required
that potential agents respond to a written questionnaire, seeking minimal background information
about the agent. No additional due diligence was required, such as an interview of the agent, or a
background check, or obtaining information beyond that provided by the answers to the
questionnaire. A senior executive of Technip admitted that the due diligence procedures adopted
by Technip were a perfunctory exercise, conducted so that Technip would have some
documentation in its files of purported due diligence. In fact, Technip executives knew that the
purpose of the agreements with the UK Agent was to funnel bribes to Nigerian officials, and
therefore certain answers by the UK Agent to the questionnaire were false.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

Technip Violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act
(Anti-Bribery Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)

32. Paragraphs | through 31 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

33. As described above, Technip, a U.S. issuer between August 30, 2001 and
November 14, 2007, through its employees and the joint venture, made use of the mails or other
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment,
promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or

authorization of the giving of anything of value, to foreign officials for the purposes of
influencing their acts or decisions, securing an improper advantage, or inducing them to use their
influence, to assist the issuer in obtaining or retaining business.
34. By reason of the foregoing, Technip violated, and unless restrained and enjoined
will continue to violate, Section 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].
SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

Technip Violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act
(Company Records and Internal Controls)

35. Paragraphs | through 34 above are realleged and incorporated by reference
herein.

36. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires companies to keep accurate
books, records and accounts which reflect fairly the transactions entered into by companies and
the disposition of its assets.

37. Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires companies to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to
maintain accountability for such assets.

38. By reason of the foregoing, Technip violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) & (B)].

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:

(1) Enter a final judgment permanently enjoining Technip from violating Sections

SEC Charges Technip with FCPA Violations

Technip to Pay $338 Million to Settle SEC and DO) Charges; Brings
Total Sanctions Against Joint Venture Partners to $917 Million

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-110

Washington, D.C., June 28, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced a settlement with Technip for multiple violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The SEC alleged that Technip, a global
engineering, construction and services company based in Paris, France, was
part of a four-company joint venture that bribed Nigerian government officials
over a 10-year period in order to win construction contracts in Nigeria worth
more than $6 billion. The SEC also charged that Technip engaged in books
and records and internal controls violations related to the bribery.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 21578

Â» SEC Complaint
Â®* Department of Justice Press Release

 

Technip will pay $98 million to settle the SECâs charges and deprive the
company of its ill-gotten gains. The firm will pay an additional $240 million
penalty in separate criminal proceedings announced today by the U.S.
Department of Justice. Previously, one of Technipâs joint venture partners,
KBR, Inc., and its former parent Halliburton Co., settled to similar charges.
Together with Technipâs payment, the combined sanctions of $917 million
represent the largest combined settlements ever paid to date to the U.S.
resulting from an FCPA violation. Technipâs American Depository Shares
traded on the New York Stock Exchange from August 2001 to November
2007.

âBribery was such an accepted practice that the joint venture had a
euphemistically-named âCultural Committeeâ where bribes were openly
discussed, approved and memorialized,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the
SECâs Division of Enforcement. âAll U.S. issuers must comply with anti-bribery
laws.â

Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement,
added, âWhen Technip became a U.S. issuer in 2001, it had an obligation to
comply with the FCPA. Instead, the complaint alleges that the company
continued with its brazen plan to make bribery payments.â

The SEC alleges that between at least 1995 and 2004, senior executives at
Technip and other members of TSK], a four-company joint venture that
includes KBR, Inc., devised and implemented a scheme to bribe Nigerian
government officials to obtain multi-billion dollar contracts to build liquefied
natural gas (LNG) production facilities. According to the SECâs complaint, from
the inception of the joint venture, Technip and the other joint venture
partners paid bribes to assist in obtaining the LNG contracts. The joint venture
partners formed a âcultural committee,â comprised of senior sales executives
at each company, to consider how to carry out the bribery scheme. To
conceal the illicit payments, the joint venture entered into sham contracts
with a shell company controlled by a U.K. solicitor and a Japanese trading
company as conduits for the bribes. Total payments to the two agents
exceeded $180 million.

The SECâs complaint also alleges that Technipâs internal controls failed to
detect or prevent the bribery, and that the companyâs records were falsified
as aresult of the bribery scheme. After Technip became a U.S. issuer in
August 2001, it became subject to the FCPA, including the FCPAâs prohibitions
on the payment of anything of value to foreign government officials in order
to obtain or retain business. Although Technip was aware of these
prohibitions, it did not implement adequate controls to ensure compliance
with the FCPA. Instead, its due diligence was a âperfunctory exerciseâ
conducted so that Technip would have some documentation in its files.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Technip has consented to
the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-
bribery, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions in Sections 30A, 13(b)
(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering
Technip to disgorge $98 million in ill-gotten profits derived from the scheme
and prejudgment interest. The proposed settlement is subject to court
approval.

In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed a criminal action against Technip, charging one count of
conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the anti-bribery
provisions of the FCPA. Technip has entered into a deferred prosecution
agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $240 million.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of
Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and foreign
authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. Robert Wilson, Ansu
Banerjee, and Stanley Cichinski conducted the SECâs investigation, which is
continuing.

SUMMARY OF ACTION
1. This matter involves violations of the books and records and internal controls

provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ) by Veraz Networks, Inc. (âVerazâ or
âthe Companyâ), a San Jose, California-based telecommunications company. From 2007 to 2008,
Veraz resellers, consultants, and employees made and offered payments to employees of
government-controlled telecommunications companies in China and Vietnam with the purpose
and effect of improperly influencing these foreign officials to award or continue to do business

with Veraz. A Veraz supervisor referred to one of the payments as the âgift scheme.â

2. Veraz failed to accurately record these improper payments on the Companyâs
books and records, and failed to implement or maintain a system of effective internal accounting
controls to prevent them in violation of the FCPA which requires public companies to keep
books and records that accurately reflect their operations, and to put in place internal controls
that are reasonably designed to ensure that their books and records are accurate.

3. The Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining Veraz from violations of
the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and requiring Veraz to pay a
civil monetary penalty.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 27 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d) and 78aa].
Defendant has, directly or indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce and of the mails in connection with the acts, transactions, practices and courses of
business alleged in this Complaint.

5. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because Defendant maintains its headquarters and transacts business within the
Northern District of California.

6. Intradistrict assignment to the San Jose Division is proper pursuant to Civil L.R.

3-2(c) because a substantial part of the events or omissions that give rise to this action occurred

in the County of Santa Clara.
DEFENDANT

direct sales force and indirect sales channels. The majority of the Companyâs revenue comes
from sales generated by offices outside the United States.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A. Veraz Made Improper Payments to Chinese Government Officials.

8. Veraz engaged a consultant in China to assist Veraz. On behalf of Veraz, the
consultant sought to sell Veraz products to a telecommunications company controlled by the
government of China (âTelecommunications Company 1â).

9. In late 2007, Verazâs consultant in China provided approximately $4,500 worth of
gifts to officials at Telecommunications Company 1 in an attempt to secure a business deal for
Veraz. The consultant requested that his Veraz supervisor approve the funding for these gifts via
email. The supervisor approved what he described in an email as the âgift scheme.â

10. : In or around January 2008, the consultant also offered a separate improper
payment to officials at Telecommunications Company 1 to secure a deal for Veraz valued at
approximately $233,000. In an email among individuals involved in the transaction, the fee was
described as a âconsultant fee,â and was set at fifteen percent or approximately $35,000.
Telecommunications Company 1 awarded the contract to Veraz even though Verazâs bid was
higher than other bids. Veraz discovered this improper offer of payment prior to receiving any
money from the transaction and cancelled the sale.

11... Veraz did not make or keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflected the improper gifts provided by Veraz to
Telecommunications Company 1. Veraz further failed to devise and maintain an effective
system of internal controls to prevent or detect violations of the FCPA.

B. Veraz Made Improper Payments to Vietnamese Government Officials.

12. In 2007 and 2008, Veraz sold products to a telecommunications company
controlled by the government of Vietnam (âTelecommunications Company 2â) through a
Singapore-based reseller. A Veraz employee, through the Singapore-based reseller, at times
made or offered illicit payments to the CEO of Telecommunications Company 2 in order to win

business for Veraz.

13. Veraz also approved-of and reimbursed its employee for questionable expenses
related to Telecommunications Company 2, including gifts and entertainment for
Telecommunications Company 2 employees and flowers for the wife of the CEO of
Telecommunications Company 2.

14. Veraz did not make or keep books, ronal and accounts which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflected the improper payments provided by Veraz to
Telecommunications Company 2. Veraz further failed to devise and maintain an effective
system of internal controls to prevent or detect violations of the FCPA.

16. As described above, Veraz failed to make and keep books, records and accounts
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected its transactions and dispositions of its

will continue to violate, the books-and-records provision of the FCPA, codified as Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].

SEC Charges California Telecommunications Company
With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-115

Washington, D.C., June 29, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed a settled federal court action against San Jose, Calif.-based
telecommunications company Veraz Networks, Inc., alleging that Veraz
violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The alleged violations stemmed from improper
payments made by Veraz to foreign officials in China and Vietnam after the
company went public in 2007.

The SEC alleges that Veraz engaged a consultant in China who in 2007 and
2008 gave gifts and offered improper payment together valued at
approximately $40,000 to officials at a government controlled
telecommunications company in China in an attempt to win business for
Veraz. A Veraz supervisor who approved the gifts described them in an
internal Veraz email as the ""gift scheme."" Similarly in 2007 and 2008, the SEC
alleges that a Veraz employee made improper payments to the CEO of a
government controlled telecommunications company in Vietnam to win
business for Veraz.

 

Additional Materials

Â» Litigation Release No. 21581
Â» SEC Complaint

 

""It is particularly important that newly public companies doing business
overseas establish the appropriate policies and procedures to prevent a
culture of payment to foreign officials from developing,"" said Marc J. Fagel,
Regional Director of the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California, Veraz violated the books and records and internal
controls provisions of the FCPA by failing to accurately record the improper
payments on its books and records, and failing to devise and maintain a
system of effective internal controls to prevent such payments. Veraz, without
admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint,
consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Veraz from
future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering Veraz to pay a penalty of $300,000.

This case was investigated by Monique C. Winkler, Robert S. Leach, and Cary
Robnett of the San Francisco Regional Office.

The Commission would like to thank the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security for its assistance in this matter.

SNAMPROGETTI NETHERLANDS B.V., Â§
Â§
Defendants. Â§
Â§

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (the âFCPAââ) of the federal securities laws by Defendants ENI, S.p.A.
(âENTâ) and its former indirect subsidiary Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V.
(âSnamprogettiâ).

2. Between at least 1995 and 2004, senior executives at Snamprogetti, among
others, devised and implemented a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to
assist in obtaining multiple contracts worth over $6 billion to build liquefied natural gas
(âLNGâ) production facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria. A four-company joint venture,
of which Snamprogetti was a member, won the contracts. To conceal the illicit
payments, Snamprogetti and others, through the joint venture, entered into sham

âconsultingâ or âservicesâ agreements with intermediaries who would then funnel their
purportedly legitimate fees to Nigerian government officials. Specifically, Snamprogetti
and others, through the joint venture, implemented this scheme by using a Gibraltar shell
company controlled by a solicitor based in the United Kingdom (âthe UK Agentâ) and a
Japanese trading company (âthe Japanese Agentâ) as conduits for the bribes.

3. As a result of the scheme, numerous books and records of Snamprogetti
and ENI contained false information relating to, among other things, the UK Agent and
the Japanese Agent, and the payments made to them. Snamprogetti did not conduct due
diligence on the UK Agent or the Japanese Agent and ENI failed to ensure that
Snamprogetti complied with ENIâs policies regarding the use of agents.

4. The Commission brings this action against the Defendants seeking
permanent injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the federal securities laws, and
seeking their ill-gotten gains.

JURISDICTION

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),
21(e) and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C.
SÂ§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa].

6. Snamprogetti ,directly or indirectly, made use of the mails and of the
means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the acts, practices
and courses of business described in this Complaint.

DEFENDANTS
7. ENI, S.p.A. is an Italian company headquartered in Rome, Italy. In 1995,

ENI registered a class of securities with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 781(b)], and thereby became a U.S. issuer. ENI common
stock and American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

8. Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. is a Dutch company headquartered in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Snamprogetti was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Snamprogetti, S.p.A., an Italian company, which in turn was a wholly-owned subsidiary
of ENI during the relevant time period. In February 2006, ENI sold Snamprogetti, S.p.A.
to Saipem, S.p.A., an Italian company. ENI owns 43% of, and exercises control over,
Saipem, S.p.A.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Snamprogetti Agrees to Pay Bribes to Obtain Nigeria LNG Contract

9. In the late 1980s, the Nigerian government created Nigeria LNG, Ltd.
(âNigeria LNGââ) to capture and sell the natural gas associated with oil production in
Nigeria. Nigeria LNG is an entity and instrumentality of the Nigerian government. At
all relevant times, the Nigerian government owned 49% or more of Nigeria LNG and,
through the directors that it appointed to the Board of Directors of Nigeria LNG, the
Nigerian government exercised control over the company. Three multinational
companies own the remainder of Nigeria LNG. Nigerian employees of Nigeria LNG
were detailed from the Nigerian Ministry of Petroleum Resources or the government-
owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. (ââNNPCââ). In the early 1990s, Nigeria LNG
invited bids to construct two LNG âtrainsâ on Bonny Island, Nigeria, estimated to be
worth $1.8 billion. An LNG train is a facility to convert raw natural gas into pure LNG,

ready for delivery to a tanker.
10. In 1990, in order to pursue LNG projects in Nigeria, Snamprogetti formed
a joint venture with three other multinational engineering and construction companies.
The joint venture began to pursue bidding on a construction contract for Nigeria LNG to
build two LNG trains in Nigeria. The joint venture operated through entities incorporated
in Madeira, Portugal.

11. Senior officers and employees at Snamprogetti were involved in the joint
venture and its business in Nigeria from the joint ventureâs inception. Each member of
the joint venture had one or more representatives on a steering committee that ran the
joint venture.

12. ENI exercised control and supervision of its wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary Snamprogetti during the relevant time and on certain of its business decisions,
such as Snamprogettiâs entry into the joint venture.

13. From the inception of the joint venture, the sales personnel and other
senior personnel of the four joint venture members believed that it was necessary to pay
bribes to Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining the LNG construction
contracts. In conjunction with the Japanese Agent, the sales personnel of the joint
venture formed what they called the âcultural committeeâ to consider how to implement,
but hide, the scheme to pay bribes. The committee members discussed: (1) entering into
sham consulting contracts with various individuals or shell corporations;

(11) âdownloadingâ or âoffloadingâ the payments through subcontractors or vendors; and
(111) entering into phony âservicesâ contracts with the Japanese Agent. Ostensibly, the

consultants or vendors would be retained and paid to perform legitimate services. In
actuality, the consultants or vendors would use the money in whole or in part to make
corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials on behalf of the joint venture.

14. Eventually, the joint venture decided to funnel the payments through two
entities, using the UK Agent to pay high-ranking Nigerian officials, and using the
Japanese Agent to pay lower-level Nigerian officials. These agents were sometimes
referred to as âCultural Advisors.â The joint venture steering committee approved the
use of the two agents, and the steering committee approved the contracts eventually
entered into between the joint venture and the two agents.

15. In pursuing the bidding with Nigeria LNG, in holding meetings of the
steering committee and the cultural committee, in carrying out the construction contracts,
and in all related matters, Snamprogetti and the other members of the joint venture
directly or indirectly made use of the U.S. mails, and of U.S. common carriers, and of
other instrumentalities of U.S. interstate commerce. Payments made by the joint venture
to the bank accounts of the UK Agent were routed through banks in New York, New
York.

The UK Agent

Trains One and Two

 

16. The joint venture decided to use the UK Agent for Trains One and Two.
Before the joint venture entered into a written contract with the UK Agent,
representatives from the joint venture traveled to Nigeria in November 1994 to meet with
high-ranking Nigerian government officials to discuss the possible use of the UK Agent.
The officials confirmed that the UK Agent was the right conduit. Senior officers at

Snamprogetti knew and approved the purpose of the trip. Thereafter, in March 1995, the
joint venture entered into an agreement to pay the UK Agent $60 million, with the
understanding that a substantial portion of this money would be funneled to Nigerian
officials as bribes.

17. In December 1995, Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture the contract to
build the first two LNG Trains, for $2.2 billion. The joint venture began construction in
1996 and finished in 2000. As the joint venture received payments for the construction
from Nigeria LNG, it paid the UK Agent. The joint venture sent a total of $60 million to
the UK Agentâs Swiss bank account between December 1995 and March 2000 for use in
making corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials.

18. As the UK Agent received these payments, the UK Agent made systematic
and substantial transfers of money to accounts owned or controlled by one or more high-
ranking Nigerian government officials.

Train Three

19. In 1996, the joint venture began pursuing a contract with Nigeria LNG to
build Train Three on Bonny Island, Nigeria. In May 1997, representatives from the joint
venture traveled to Nigeria to meet with high-ranking Nigerian government officials to
confirm that the UK Agent was still the correct intermediary to use to pay bribes. Senior
officers at Snamprogetti knew and approved the purpose of the trip.

20. In February 1999, following a change in government, representatives from
the joint venture traveled to Nigeria to meet a high-ranking Nigerian government official
who confirmed that the UK Agent was the correct intermediary. The Nigerian official
also appointed his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount. In March 1999, a

senior officer from Snamprogetti and others from the joint venture met with the Nigerian
officialâs representative in London to negotiate the amount of the bribes to be paid in
connection with the award of the Train Three LNG contract. Snamprogetti, along with
the other joint venture partners, agreed to pay $32.5 million through the UK Agent.

21. Days after the London meeting, Nigeria LNG awarded the Train Three
contract to the joint venture for $1.2 billion. The joint venture then entered into a new
agreement with the UK Agent for the $32.5 million negotiated at the London meeting.
Between March 1999 and May 2003, the joint venture paid the UK Agent, directing the
payments to the UK Agentâs bank accounts in Switzerland and Monaco. After receiving
the money, the UK Agent made substantial payments to accounts controlled by one or
more high-ranking Nigerian government officials.

Trains Four and Five

 

22. In approximately 2001, the joint venture discussed the award of the next
series of LNG Trains. In November 2001, representatives from the joint venture again
traveled to Nigeria to meet a high-ranking government official, who confirmed that the
UK Agent was still acceptable to serve as a conduit for the payments and who appointed
his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount.

23. In December 2001, the joint venture entered into another agreement with
the UK Agent in connection with Trains Four and Five for $51 million. In March 2002,
Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture a $1.6 billion contract to build Trains Four and
Five. Between March 2002 and January 2004, the joint venture paid the UK Agent
$40 million under the sham consulting agreement. After receiving the money, the UK
Agent made substantial transfers of money to one or more high-ranking Nigerian

government officials.
24. Between 2002 and April 30, 2003, the UK Agent used a subcontractor on
the Nigeria LNG project (the âSubcontractorââ) to transfer $5 million to a Nigerian
government official for the benefit of a Nigerian political party. The Subcontractor
official, the UK Agent and the Nigerian government official met in London in June 2002
to discuss the terms of the transfer.

25. Beginning in August 2002, the UK Agent wire transferred $5 million from
money received from the joint venture to a bank account of the Subcontractor in the U.K.
The Subcontractor then transferred this money to a bank account in Nigeria. Thereafter,
as the money came in, the Subcontractor withdrew cash in U.S. dollars or in local
currency and delivered the money to the Nigerian official.

26. On several occasions, the Subcontractor personally hand-delivered
$1 million in U.S. currency in a brief case to the Nigerian official in a hotel room in
Abuja, Nigeria. The Subcontractor delivered the remainder of the $5 million to the
Nigerian official in local Nigerian currency, the Naira. Because the Naira was too bulky
to deliver by hand, the Subcontractor loaded the cash into vehicles, which were delivered
to the Nigerian official.

The Japanese Agent

27. As alleged above, Snamprogetti and others in the joint venture agreed to
use the Japanese Agent to make corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian government
officials in connection with the Bonny Island LNG Trains.

28. Between 1996 and 2002, the joint venture entered into three âservicesâ
agreements with the Japanese Agent. Snamprogetti and others authorized and directed

the joint venture to enter into each of the agreements with the Japanese Agent intending
and expecting that the Japanese Agent would use money it received under these
agreements to offer and make corrupt payments to lower-level Nigerian officials to assist
in obtaining the LNG contracts to build Trains One through Five.

29. Between 1996 and June 14, 2004, when the payments ended, the joint
venture paid the Japanese Agent more than $50 million.

Snamprogettiâs Books and Records Contained False Information

30. In numerous joint venture company records, the payments to the UK
Agent and the Japanese Agent were falsely characterized as legitimate âconsultingâ or
âservicesâ fees when, in fact, they were bribes. Snamprogettiâs business records also
contained the contracts with the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent, which falsely
described the purpose of the contracts in order to make it appear that the agents would
perform legitimate services. These documents were part of Snamprogettiâs business
records and supported Snamprogettiâs financial statements, which were consolidated into
ENIâs financial statements.

ENIâs Internal Controls Failed to Detect, Deter or Prevent Bribery

31. Snamprogetti did not conduct any due diligence on either the UK Agent or
the Japanese Agent. ENIâs policies and procedures governed Snamprogettiâs use of
agents. ENI failed to ensure that Snamprogetti conducted due diligence on agents hired
through joint ventures in which Snamprogetti participated. As a result, ENIâs internal

controls failed to detect, deter or prevent the decades-long bribery scheme.
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

Snamprogetti Violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act
(Anti-Bribery Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)

32. Paragraphs | through 31 are realleged and incorporated herein by
reference.

33. As described above, Snamprogetti, an agent of a U.S. issuer, made use of
the mails or other means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any
money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value,
to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing their acts or decisions, securing an
improper advantage, or inducing them to use their influence, to assist the issuer in
obtaining or retaining business.

34. By reason of the foregoing, Snamprogetti violated, and unless restrained
and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§
78dd-1).

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

ENI Violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and _13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act
(Company Records and Internal Controls)

35. Paragraphs | through 34 above are realleged and incorporated by
reference herein.

36. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires companies to keep
accurate books, records and accounts which reflect fairly the transactions entered into by

companies and the disposition of its assets.

10
37. Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires companies to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and to maintain accountability for such assets.

38. By reason of the foregoing, ENI violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) & (B)].

THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Snamprogetti Violated of Section 13(b)(6)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1
(Company Records and Internal Controls)

39. Paragraphs | through 38 above are realleged and incorporated by
reference herein.

AO. As described above, during the relevant period Snamprogetti knowingly
falsified, and directly or indirectly, caused to be falsified certain books, records, or
accounts that supported the financial statements of ENI, a U.S. issuer, subject to
Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)]. As a result of
Snamprogettiâs conduct, the books and records that supported the financial statements of
ENI falsely reflected the payments to the UK Agent and the Japanese Agent as legitimate
business expenses instead of bribes. By falsifying documents and authorizing the agent
contracts and by failing to conduct any due diligence on the agents, Snamprogetti also
knowingly circumvented certain internal accounting controls of ENI.

41. By reason of the foregoing, Snamprogetti violated Section 13(b)(5) of the

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(5)] and Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1].

SEC Charges Italian Company and Dutch Subsidiary in
Scheme Bribing Nigerian Officials With Carloads of Cash

ENI and Snamprogetti to Pay $365 Million to Settle FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-119

Washington, D.C., July 7, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged Italian company ENI, S.p.A. and its former Dutch subsidiary
Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. with multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) in a bribery scheme that included deliveries of cash-filled
briefcases and vehicles to Nigerian government officials to win construction
contracts.

Snamprogetti and ENI will jointly pay $125 million to settle the SEC's charges,
and Snamprogetti will pay an additional $240 million penalty to settle
separate criminal proceedings announced today by the U.S. Department of
Justice.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 21588
Â» SEC Complaint

 

ENI and Snamprogetti are the latest to be charged in the decade-long
Nigerian bribery scheme conducted by a joint venture of companies that also
included Technip and KBR, Inc., both named in previous SEC enforcement
actions. Technip, KBR and its former parent Halliburton Company paid a
combined $917 million to settle FCPA charges. The $365 million to be paid by
ENI and Snamprogetti brings the total sanctions against the companies
involved in the scheme to more than $1.28 billion.

According to the SEC's complaint against ENI and Snamprogetti, filed today in
federal district court in Houston, senior executives at Snamprogetti and the
other joint venture companies authorized the hiring of two agents, a U.K.
solicitor and a Japanese trading company, through which more than $180
million in bribes were funneled to Nigerian government officials to obtain
several contracts to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities on Bonny
Island, Nigeria. The Nigerian government exercised majority control over the
company that awarded the contracts â Nigeria LNG Ltd.

""This elaborate bribery scheme featured sham intermediaries, Swiss bank
accounts, and carloads of cash as everyone involved made a concerted effort
to cover their tracks,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of
Enforcement. ""But the billion-plus dollars in sanctions paid by these
companies show that ultimately there is no hiding or profiting from bribery.""

Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement,
added, ""In the three settlements, the joint venture companies disgorge their
$400 million in profits from the illicit contracts, the largest combined
disgorgement amount ever in an FCPA violation.""

The SEC's complaint alleges that senior sales executives at the joint venture
companies formed a ""cultural committee"" to consider how to implement and
hide the bribery scheme through sham consulting and services contracts with
subcontractors or vendors. After Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture
companies a $2.2 billion LNG-related construction contract in December 1995,
the companies sent a total of $60 million to the U.K. agent's Swiss bank
account over the next 52 months. The U.K. agent transferred the money to
accounts owned or controlled by high-ranking Nigerian government officials.

The SEC alleges that following a change in Nigerian government in 1999,
representatives from the joint venture companies traveled to Nigeria to meet
a high-ranking government official to continue the scheme. The official
confirmed that the U.K. agent was the correct intermediary, and also
appointed his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount. A senior
officer from Snamprogetti and others from the joint venture met with the
Nigerian official's representative in London and negotiated an amount of
$32.5 million to be delivered through the U.K. agent. Days after the London
meeting, Nigeria LNG awarded a contract to the joint venture companies for
$1.2 billion.

The SEC alleges that in 2002 and 2003, the U.K. agent used a subcontractor
on the Nigeria LNG project to transfer millions of dollars to a Nigerian
government official for the benefit of a Nigerian political party. The
subcontractor personally hand-delivered U.S. cash in briefcases to the
Nigerian official in a hotel room in Abuja, Nigeria. The subcontractor also
delivered the bribes to the Nigerian official in local Nigerian currency, the
Naira. In these instances, because the Naira was too bulky to deliver by hand,
the cash was loaded into a vehicle for delivery to the Nigerian official.

The SEC's complaint also alleges that ENI failed to ensure that its former
subsidiary, Snamprogetti, complied with ENI's internal controls concerning the
use of agents, and that the books and records of both companies were
falsified as a result of the bribery scheme. After ENI became a U.S. issuer in
1995, it became subject to the FCPA, including the requirement to create and
maintain adequate internal controls.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Snamprogetti has
consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating
the anti-bribery and recordkeeping and internal controls provisions in Sections
30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b2-1, and
ENI has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from
violating the recordkeeping and internal controls provisions in Sections 13(b)
(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. Snamprogetti and ENI also
consented to the entry of court orders that require them, jointly and severally,
to pay $125 million in disgorgement. The proposed settlements are subject to
court approval.

In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed a criminal action against Snamprogetti, charging one count of
conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of aiding and abetting violations
of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Snamprogetti has entered into a
deferred prosecution agreement with the DO) and agreed to pay a criminal
penalty of $240 million.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kara Brockmeyer, Robert Wilson,
Ansu Banerjee, and Stanley Cichinski. The SEC acknowledges the assistance
of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of
Investigation; and foreign authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ), alleges
that:
SUMMARY
1. This case involves the payment of illegal kickbacks to Iraqi government
ministries in connection with sales of humanitarian goods under the United Nations |
UN?) Oil for Food Program (the âProgramâ). From approximately 2000 to 2003, two.

subsidiaries of the General Electric Company (âGEâ) -- Marquette-Hellige (âMarquetteâ)
and OEC-Medical Systems (Europa) AG (âOEC-Medicalââ) -- made approximately

$2.04 million in Kickback payments in the form of computer equipment, medical
supplies, and services to the Iraqi Health Ministry under the Program. Prior to GEâs
acquisition of their parent companies, two other current GE subsidiaries -- Ionics Italba
S.r.L. (âIonics Italbaâ), and Nycomed Imaging AS, currently GE Healthcare AS
(âNycomedâ) -- made approximately $1.55 million in.cash kickback payments under the
Program. Nycomed was a subsidiary of publicly-registered Amersham plc, which was
acquired by GE after the conduct at issue in this Complaint and is currently known as GE
Healthcare Ltd. Ionics Italba was a subsidiary of publicly-registered Ionics, Inc., which
was acquired by GE after the conduct at issue in this Complaint and is currently known as
GE Ionics, Inc.

2. Marquette, OEC-Medical, Tonics italba, and Nycomed each authorized
and paid kickbacks to Iraqi government ministries through agents in the form of âafter-
sales service feesâ (âASSF paymentsâ) on sales of products to Iraq. All four subsidiaries
knew that such kickbacks were prohibited by the Oil for Food Program and U.S. and
international trade sanctions on Iraq.

3. The Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief to
the Iraqi population, then subject to comprehensive international trade sanctions. The
Program allowed the Iraqi government to purchase necessary humanitarian goods, but
required that all purchases be made through a UN-controlled escrow account. The
kickbacks paid in connection with all four subsidiariesâ Oil for Food contracts had the
effect of diverting funds out of the â account and, with respect to the cash

kickbacks paid by Ionics Italba and Nycomed, into an Iraqi slush fund.
4. As a result of this conduct, GE, Ionics, and Amersham each violated
Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)] by failing to maintain
accurate books and records and by failing to ensure that its subsidiaries maintained

adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the illegal kickbacks.

JURISDICTION

ae This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 US.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. GE, Ionics, and
Amersham directly or indirectly made use of the means or sasteumnentalities of interstate
commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection

FACTS

| The United Nations Oil for Food Program

14. The Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for
the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under the international trade sanctions
that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Starting in December 1996, the Program
permitted the Iraqi government to sell its crude oil and use the proceeds to purchase food,
medicine, and critical infrastructure supplies. By the end of the Program, Iraq had sold
$64.2 billion worth of crude oil and purchased $34.5 billion in humanitarian supplies

15. The proceeds of the oil sales were transferred directly from the buyers to
an escrow account (the âUN Escrow Accountâ) maintained in New York by the United
_ Nations 661 Committee. Funds in the UN Escrow Account were available for the
purchase of humanitarian supplies, subject to UN approval and supervision. The intent of
this structure was to prevent the proceeds of Iraqâs crude oil sales from undermining the
sanctions regime by providing the regime of Saddam Hussein with access to hard
currency.

| 16. | Corruption was rampant within the Program. By mid-2000, all Iraqi

ministries participating in the Program followed a policy of demanding that all suppliers
of humanitarian goods pay a ten percent kickback on each contract. The kickback
requirement was euphemistically referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee (âASSFâ).

Suppliers competing to obtain contracts under the Program were encouraged to inflate

their contract bids by ten percent to cover the ASSF kickback. Once accepted, the
inflated Contact prices were incorporated into the Oil for Food contracts. In this manner,
it was the UN Escrow Account that ultimately funded the kickback payments.

17. Following the 2004 release of a report by the US. General Accounting
Office exposing some of the abuses, thÃ© UN commissioned an independent inquiry
conunittee, headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul. Volcker, (the âVolcker
Committeeâ) to investigate the Programâs performance. That committeeâs October 27,
2005, final report estimated that the Iraqi government had diverted $1.7 billion in illicit
income from the Program. Of that, $1.5 billion was derived from kickbacks that were
demanded from suppliers of humanitarian goods to Traq.

18. Starting in mid-2000, the Iraqi government made a concerted effort to
subvert the Pro gram by demanding secret kickbacks from suppliers of humanitarian
goods. Although contracts entered into pursuant to the Program were subject to UN
review and approval, the Program gave the Iraqi authorities discretion to select the
companies from which they purchased goods and to negotiate contract terms. Each Iraqi
ministry determined what humanitarian goods it needed and circulated tenders seeking
requests for bids. Suppliers submitted bids for the sale of their goods. After the ministry
accepted the winning bid, it informed the supplier that it had to pay an under-the-table
kickback in the form.of an ASSF to the ministry as a condition of the contract. The
ASSF had to be paid before the goods entered into the country or the shipment would be

held at the border.

19. | When the kickback scheme began, suppliers typically met with the Iraqi
ministries in person and signed side agreements acknowledging their obligation to-pay

the kickbacks. The side agreements were not provided to the UN, as required, when the
| Oil for Food contracts were submitted and approved. By October 2000, the kickback
amount was usually ten percent of the total contract value. As the scheme progressed,
and the participants grew more accustomed to making the ten percent payment, the use of
signed side agreements became less common. Suppliers simply increased their original
contract bids by ten percent and submitted the inflated contracts to the UN for approval,
without disclosure of the ten percent kickback. Once a supplier paid the ASSF iGicktvaetc
to the Iraqi ministry and shipped the goods called for sindes the contract, the UN Escrow
Account paid the supplier the inflated contract price, unknowingly reimbursing the
supplier for the ten percent kickback. | |

20. Following the United States invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the UN,
working with the Coalition Provisional Authority, halted the ASSF kickback scheme.. All

Program contracts then pending were renegotiated to back-out the ten percent kickback.
I. Payment of ASSFs under the Program

21. Four current GE subsidiaries, only two of which were GE subsidiaries
during the relevant period, engaged in Oil for Food transactions involving ASSF
kickbacks: Marquette; OEC-Medical; Nycomed; and lonies Italba. These subsidiaries
entered into a total of eighteen contracts in which ASSF kickbacks were either made or
authorized. In total, the subsidiaries, working through third-party agents, made ASSF
kickback payments of approximately $3,584,842. The four subsidiaries earned profits of

approximately $18,397,949 as a result of their illegal kickbacks.

A. In-Kind Kickbacks Paid on Marquette Contracts
22. . Marquette, based in Germany, manufactures and sells cardiology

monitoring equipment and has been a GE subsidiary since 1998. In 2000 and 2001,
Marquette entered into three Program exinitrant in which it either paid or agreed to pay
illegal kickbacks in the form of computer equipment, medical supplies, and services. The Â©
contracts were for the supply of medical equipment (disposable electrodes, transducers,
and fetal monitors) to the Iraqi Health Ministry. The contracts generated a combined
gross profit to Marquette of $8.8 million.

23. In order to obtain two of the contracts, Marquetteâs Iraqi agent made
in-kind kickback payments of goods and services worth approximately $1.2 million to the
Iraqi Health Ministry in violation of UN regulations. In order to obtain the third contract,
the agent offered to make an additional in-kind kickback payment worth approximately
$250,000. The illegal kickbacks were made or offered with the knowledge and approval
of Marquette officials.

24. The Iraqi agent negotiated all three of the contracts on Marquetteâs behalf. _

| The contracts were direct agreements between Marquette and the Iraqi Ministry of |
Health. As the contracts were ee negotiated, both the agent and two Marquette sales
managers were present at meetings with the Iraqi Health Ministry when Iraqi government
officials demanded the payment of ten percent kickbacks. The Marquette officials
declined to make cash payments to the Iraqi ministry. But they acquiesced when their
agent offered instead to make the payments on Marquetteâs behalf in the form of
computer equipment, medical supplies, and services equal to ten percent of the contractsâ
value. The UN regulations governing the Program prohibited extra-contractual payments
of any kind, whether made in the form of goods and services or cash.

25. In order to cover the cost of the illegal kickbacks, Marquette increased the

Iraqi agentâs commission from approximately 13% of the contract price to approximately
23%. The agent used the extra 10% to cover the cost of the equipment and services he
kicked back to the Iraqi ministry. The UN contract prices were inflated by a
corresponding 10% amount. The UN inspectors were never advised that a portion of the
agentâs increased commission was intended to cover extra-contractual in-kind kickbacks
to Iraqi government ministries.

26. At one point during the performance of a Marquette contract to supply
domes transducers, Iraqi customs officials stopped the Marquette shipment at the border
until the shipper could prove that the ASSF kickback payment had been made.
Subsequent email exchanges among the shipper, Marquetteâs Iraqi agent, and Marquette
officials, refer to the need to document the ASSF payment. After the Iraqi agent supplied
proof of the ASSF kickback payment, the goods were ultimately allowed into Iraq.

27. Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the third of the Marquette
contracts was renegotiated by the UN. During the course of renegotiation, an employee
of Marquetteâs Iraqi agent provided false information to the UN regarding the kickbacks.
The agent falsely stated that the.contract had been negotiated with the Iraqi Health
Ministry before ths lagi officials began demanding kickbacks on Program contracts.
The Marquette sales manager was advised of the misrepresentation to the UN and there
is no indication that he made any effort to correct the false statement. When the UN
eliminated the ten percent kickback from the contract, Marquette reduced the Iraqi
agentâs commission from 23% to 13% of the contract price, consistent with the partiesâ
understanding that the kickback was to have been funded out of the agentâs commission.

28. The in-kind ASSF payments were inaccurately described in Marquetteâs

books and records as commissions or other legitimate business expenses. Marquette also

10
failed to maintain adequate internal controls to detect or prevent the illicit in-kind ASSF
payments. .
B. In-Kind Kickbacks Paid on OEC-Medical Contracts

29. OEC-Medical, based in Switzerland, manufactures and sells mÃ©dical
equipment. OEC was a GE subsidiary throughout the relevant period. In 2000, OEC-
Medical entered into one Program contract that included an illegal kickback payment.
The contract was to provide C-Arms (C-shaped armatures used to support X-ray
equipment) to the Iraqi Ministry of Health. OEC made an in-kind kickback payment .
erorth approximately $870,000 on the contract and earned a wrongful profit of
$2.1 million. |

30. | The OEC-Medical contract was negotiated by the same third party agent
that handled the Marquette contracts. During the contract negotiation, the OEC-Medical
salesman reSponsihile for the contract attended meetings in Baghdad with the agent,
where they were told by Iraqi Health Ministry officials that the contract would require a
ten percent kickback. As was done with the Marquette contracts, the Iraqi agent agreed
to make the payment on behalf of OEC-Medical in the form of computer equipment,
medical supplies, and services, rather than cash.

31. To reimburse the Iraqi agent for the cost of the kickback, OEC-Medical
_ increased the agentâs commission on the contract by approximately 10% (from 5% of the
contract price to 15%). The contract price that OEC-Medical charged to the UN was
artificially increased by a commensurate amount. In order to conceal from UN inspectors
the fact that the agentâs commission had been increased to cover an illegal kickback,

' OEC-Medical and the agent entered into a fictitious âservices provider agreementâ in

1]
November 2000. The fictitious agreement purported to identify services the agent would
perform to justify his ineteanedl commission. Those services, however, were not part of
OEC-Medicalâs actual contract with the Iraqi Health Ministry and were never intended to |
be performed. The sham agreement was nonetheless provided to the UN for inspection
as part of the contract package.

32. When the C-Amms were shipped to Iraq in the Summer of 2001, email
traffic among OEC-Medical officials, the Iraqi agent, and the shipping company referred
explicitly to the need to prove that the kickback payment had been made in order to clear
the goods across the Iraqi border. OEC-Medicalâs Iraqi agent confirmed in writing to
OEC-Medical and the shipper that he would see to it that the cost of the kickback would
come out of his commission. The in-kind kickback was made, and the goods were
subsequently allowed into Iraq.

33. The in-kind ASSF payments were inaccurately described in OEC-
Medicalâs books and records as commissions or other legitimate business expenses.
OEC-Medical also failed to maintain adequate internal controls to detect or prevent the

illicit in-kind ASSF payments.

C. Cash Kickbacks Paid on Nycomed Contracts
34. During the Program, Nycomed was a subsidiary of Amersham, which was
acquired by GE in 2004 Nycomedâs conduct at issue in this Complaint occurred prior to
the acquisition. Amersham plc listed American Depository Receipts on the NYSE and
was therefore subject to the Commissionâs regulatory jurisdiction. GE acquired the

liabilities of Amersham, along with the assets, in its acquisition of Amersham.

12
35. Between 2000 and2002, Nycomed entered into nine contracts involving
the payment of cash ASSF kickbacks. The nine Nycomed contracts were all direct
agreements between Nycomed and che Iraqi Ministry of Health for the provision of
Omnipaque and Omniscan. Omanipaque is an injectible contrast agent used in
conjunction with X-rays; and Omniscan is a contrast agent used in conj unction with
. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nycomed paid approximately $750,000 if
__ kickbacks on the nine contracts and earned approximately $5 million in wrongful profits.

36. The contracts were negotiated by Nycomedâs Jordanian agent. The
kickback payments were explicitly authorized by Nycomedâs salesman in Cyprus. The
Nycomed salesman increased the agentâs commission from 17.5% to 27.5% of the
contract price, and artificially increased the UN contract prices by 10%, all to cover the
cost of the kickbacks. Numerous email messages between the Nycomed salesman and |
the Jordanian agent allude to the connection between the increased commission rate and
the kickback payments.

37. In one instance, a UN official inquired into the basis for the 27.5%
commission being paid to the Jordanian agent. The inquiry triggered a panicked email â
message from a Nycomed marketing coordinator in Norway who was also aware of the
âkickback payments, to officials at Nycomed responsible for handling the UN inquiry. In
response, a Nycomed manager sent a letter to the UN falsely describing the work that-the
Jordanian agent was to perform to justify. its commission, omitting that 10% of the 27.5%

was to cover Iraqi kickback payments.

13
38. The ASSF payments were inaccurately described in Nycomedâs books and
records as commissions or other legitimate business expenses. Nycomed also failed to

maintain adequate internal controls to detect or prevent the illicit ASSF payments.

D. Cash Kickbacks Paid on Ionics Italba Contracts

39. Ionics Italba was a subsidiary of Jonics, which was acquired by GE in
2005. Ionics Italbaâs conduct occurred prior to the acquisition. Tonics was a publicly-
listed company in the United States and was subject to the Commissionâs regulatory
jaietiavial throughout the relevant period. GE acquired Ionicsâ liabilities, along with the
assets, in its acquisition of Ionics.

40. Ionics Italba, based in Italy, manufactures and sells water purification
equipment. Between 2000 and 2002, Ionics Italba paid $795,000 in kickbacks and earned
$2.3 million in wrongful profits on five Program contracts to sell equipment to the Iraqi
Oil Ministry. The five Program contracts were all direct agreements between Ionics
Italba and the Iraqi Oil Ministry for the provision of water treatment equipment. The
contracts were negotiated by Ionics Italbaâs Jordanian agent. Four of the five contracts
were negotiated with side letters documenting the commitment of Ionics Italba to make
the cash kickback payments. The side letters were concealed from UN inspectors in
violation of a Program requirement to provide all contract documentation for inspection
and UN approval.

41. In the first of these contracts, the illegal kickback payment was concealed
under a fictitious line item for âmodification and adaptation at site of obsolete spare
parts.â When UN inspectors in January 2001 requested additional detail about the line

item, officials at Ionics Italba passed the inquiry along to the Iraqi Oil Ministry. The

14
Ministryâs proposed response, villichs described services neither party intended to be
performed, was incorporated nearly verbatim in a letter that Ionics Italba provided to the
UN, after which the contract was approved. When the contract was performed, the UN
paid for the services in two installments -- 90% for the products called for under the
contract and 10% for the phony modification services. The Iraqi Oil Ministry prepared
and sent a false invoice to cover the second payment.

42. In subsequent contracts, the ten percent kickback requirement was simply
incorporated into the agentâs commission and was not identified in a separate contract
line item. On all five contracts, Ionics Italba attificially inflated the prices charged to the
UN by 10% to â the cost of the kickback payments. The purpose of the 10% price
increase was not disclosed to UN inspectors. On the majority of the Ionics Italba
contracts, the invoices provided by the sales agent included fictitious activities to justify
the agentâs inflated commission.

43. The kickback payments are reflected in invoices and bank records of |
payments from Ionics Italba to the sales agent that served as its payment intermediary.
The sales agent made the payments to the Iraqi Oil Ministry through a Saudi Arabian
front company acting on the Ministryâs behalf. - |

44. The ASSF payments were inaccurately described in Ionics Italbaâs books
and records as commissions or other legitimate business expenses. Ionics Italba also
failed to maintain adequate internal controls to detect or prevent the illicit ASSF.

payments.

SEC Charges General Electric and Two Subsidiaries with
FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-133

 

Washington, D.C., July 27, 2010 â The
Securities and Exchange Commission today High-Res Photo
charged General Electric Company with
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) for its involvement in a $3.6 million
kickback scheme with Iraqi government
agencies to win contracts to supply medical
equipment and water purification equipment.

The SEC alleges that two GE subsidiaries â
along with two other subsidiaries of public
companies that have since been acquired by
GE â made illegal kickback payments in the
form of cash, computer equipment, medical
supplies, and services to the Iraqi Health
Ministry or the Iraqi Oil Ministry in order to

 

 

 

obtain valuable contracts under the U.N. Oil ""GE failed to maintain

for Food Program. adequate internal controls

Additional Materials illicit payments by its two
subsidiaries to win Oil for

Â® Litigation Release No. 20602 Food contracts, and it failed

Â» SEC Complaint to properly record the true

nature of the payments in
its accounting records.""

 

GE agreed to pay $23.4 million to settle the
SEC's charges against the company as well as
the two subsidiaries for which GE assumed
liability upon acquiring: lonics Inc. and
Amersham plc. The SEC charged GE, lonics
and Amersham with violating the books and
records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The SEC has now taken
15 FCPA enforcement actions against companies involved in Oil for Food-
related kickback schemes with Iraq, recovering more than $204 million.

Cheryl Scarboro
Chief of SEC's FCPA
Enforcement Unit

 

 

 

""Bribes and kickbacks are bad business, period,"" said Robert Khuzami,
Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This case affirms that law
enforcement is active across the globe - offshore does not mean off-limits.""

Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit,
added, ""GE failed to maintain adequate internal controls to detect and
prevent these illicit payments by its two subsidiaries to win Oil for Food
contracts, and it failed to properly record the true nature of the payments in
its accounting records. Furthermore, corporate acquisitions do not provide GE
immunity from FCPA enforcement of the other two subsidiaries involved.""

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, the kickback scheme occurred from approximately 2000 to 2003.
GE subsidiaries Marquette-Hellige and OEC-Medical Systems (Europa) AG
made approximately $2.04 million in kickback payments to the Iraqi
government under the Oil for Food Program. lonics Italba S.r.L. (a then-
subsidiary of lonics) and Nycomed Imaging AS (a then-subsidiary of
Amersham) made approximately $1.55 million in cash kickback payments.
Since their acquisitions by GE, Amersham and lonics are now known as GE
Healthcare Ltd. and GE lonics, Inc., respectively.

The SEC alleges that Germany-based Marquette paid or agreed to pay illegal
kickbacks in the form of computer equipment, medical supplies, and services
on three contracts worth $8.8 million. Through an Iragi third-party agent,
Marquette paid goods and services worth approximately $1.2 million to the
Iraqi Health Ministry in order to obtain two of the contracts. The agent offered
to make an additional in-kind kickback payment worth approximately
$250,000 to obtain the third contract.

The SEC further alleges that Switzerland-based OEC-Medical made an in-kind
kickback payment of approximately $870,000 on one contract worth $2.1
million through the same third-party agent who handled the Marquette
contracts. OEC-Medical and the agent entered into a fictitious ""services
provider agreement"" identifying phony services the agent would perform in
order to justify his increased commission and conceal the illegal kickback
from U.N. inspectors.

According to the SEC's complaint, Norway-based Nycomed entered into nine
contracts with Iraqi ministries involving the payment of approximately
$750,000 in cash kickbacks between 2000 and 2002. As a result, Nycomed
earned approximately $5 million in wrongful profits on the contracts. GE
acquired Nycomed's parent company â Amersham â in 2004. Italy-based
lonics Italba was a subsidiary of lonics, Inc., which GE acquired in 2005.
Between 2000 and 2002, lonics Italba paid $795,000 in kickbacks and earned
$2.3 million in wrongful profits on five Program contracts to sell water
treatment equipment to the Iraqi Oil Ministry. GE acquired its parent company
- lonics Inc., in 2005.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GE as well as lonics (now
GE lonics Inc.) and Amersham (now GE Healthcare Ltd.) have consented to
the entry of a court order permanently enjoining them from future violations
of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. GE is ordered to pay $18,397,949 in disgorgement of profits,
$4,080,665 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $1 million. GE
cooperated with the investigation.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud
Section and the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee. Tracy L. Price
and Robert I. Dodge conducted the SEC's investigation, which is continuing.

SEC Charges Two Individuals for Roles in Innospec FCPA
Scheme

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-141

 

Washington, D.C., Aug. 5, 2010 â The
Securities and Exchange Commission today High-Res Photo
charged a former business director at
Innospec, Inc., and the company's third-party
agent in Iraq with violating the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by engaging in
widespread bribery of Iraqi government
officials to land contracts under the United
Nations Oil-for-Food Program and continue
selling a fuel additive to Iraq after the
program ended. Bribes also were paid to
Indonesian officials to enable Innospec to sell
the fuel additive to Indonesian state-owned oil

 

companies.

The SEC, which char Inn rlier thi

government in return for the Oil-for-Food ee
contracts. Enforcement Unit

 

 

 

Both Turner and Naaman agreed to settle the
SEC's charges against them.

""The illegal conduct by Turner and Naaman enabled Innospec to improperly
obtain contracts from which the company reaped millions of dollars in illicit
profits,"" said Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act Unit.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia, Turner and Naaman played key roles in Innospec's bribery
activities in Irag, which began with the company's participation in the U.N. Oil-
for-Food Program in 2001 and extended until at least 2008. Turner also
actively participated in the bribery scheme in Indonesia, which began as early
as 2000 and continued until 2005. Innospec, a manufacturer and distributor of
fuel additives and specialty chemicals, made illicit payments of more than
$6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in bribes to government
officials in Iraq and Indonesia to sell tetraethyl lead (TEL). The contracts that
Innospec obtained in exchange for the bribes were worth approximately $176
million.

The SEC alleges that Naaman paid kickbacks to Iraq on Innospec's behalf so
that the company could obtain five Oil-for-Food Program contracts for the sale
of TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries. Naaman
aided Innospec in obtaining the Oil-for-Food contracts by paying kickbacks
equaling 10 percent of the contract value on three of the contracts. When the
Oil-for-Food Program ended shortly before Innospec was to pay promised
kickbacks on the two remaining contracts, Innospec kept the promised
payments as part of its profit. When Innospec's internal auditors questioned
Turner about the nature of the commission payments that were made to
Naaman under the Oil-for-Food Program, Turner made false statements to the
auditors and concealed the fact that the commission payments to Naaman
included kickbacks to the Iraqi government in return for contracts.

The SEC alleges that after the Oil-for-Food Program ended in late 2003,
Turner and Naaman continued to pay bribes to Iraqi officials in order to secure
TEL business contracts from Iraq. In one e-mail, Naaman informed Turner and
other management that Iraqi officials were demanding a 2 percent kickback
related to one TEL order. Naaman stated, ""We are sharing most of our profits
with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we will lose the
market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get
the rewards."" In his response to the e-mail, Turner confirmed that the
requested kickback would be paid through an additional 2 percent
""commission"" to Naaman.

According to the SEC's complaint, Turner and senior Innospec officials also
directed Naaman to pay a bribe of $155,000 to Iraqi officials to ensure the
failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured by a
competitor of Innospec. Turner and other Innospec officials also authorized
payments, through Naaman, to fund lavish trips for Iraqi officials, including
the seven-day honeymoon of one official. Innospec officials and Turner also
arranged for Naaman to pay thousands of dollars in cash to Iraqi officials for
""pocket money"" on trips funded by Innospec.

The SEC's complaint also alleges that Turner and senior Innospec officials
authorized and directed the payment of bribes to Indonesian government
officials to win contracts for Innospec. More than $2.8 million in bribes was
funneled through an Indonesian agent. These involved bribes paid annually to
a senior official at BP Migas, ""special commissions"" paid to a Swiss account,
and a ""one off"" payment of $300,000. On one occasion, a managing director
of Innospec informed Turner that Innospec had provided payments to its
Indonesian agent to fund the purchase of a Mercedes for a Pertamina official.

Turner agreed to disgorge $40,000 to settle the SEC's charges against him.
Despite facing significant financial penalties, none were sought against him
based on, among other things, his extensive and ongoing cooperation in the
investigation. Naaman agreed to disgorge $810,076 plus prejudgment
interest of $67,030, and pay a penalty of $438,038 that will be deemed
satisfied by a criminal order requiring him to pay a criminal fine that is at
least equal to the civil penalty amount. Naaman cooperated in the
investigation after his extradition to the United States.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Turner and Naaman also
consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from
violating Exchange Act Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1
thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Innospec's violations of Exchange
Act Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and as to Turner, from violating
Rule 13b2-2. The proposed settlements are subject to court approval.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud
Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.K.'s SFO in this matter.
Tracy L. Price and Denise Y. Hansberry conducted the SEC's investigation,
which is continuing.

Description: General Civil
Vv.

ALLIANCE ONE INTERNATIONAL, INC. | : COMPLAINT

Defendant.

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY

1. During the period from 1996 through 2004, Dimon, Incorporated (âDimonâ)
made multiple improper payments to foreign officials in Kyrgyzstan and Thailand in violation of
| the: Foreign Corrupt P Practices Act of 1977 cPGP ET) During the period from 2001 through
| 2004, Standard Commercial Corporation (âStandardâ) made multiple i improper or paynients to |
foreign officials in Thailand in violation of the FCPA. In May 2005, Dimon and Standard
merged to form Alliance One International, Inc. (âAlliance Oneâ).

2. From 1996 through 2004, Dimon International Kyrayzstan (âDIKâ), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Dimon, paid more than $3 million in bribes to Kyrgyzstan government
officials in order to purchase Keepy tobacco for resale to Dimonâs customers. These payments
were made to various government officials, including officials of the JSC GAK Kyrgyztamekisi
(âTamekisiâ) and local public officials (âAkimsâ). DIK also made improper payments to

Kyrgyzstan tax officials. Dimonâs Country Manager authorized, directed, and made these
improper payments in Kyrgyzstan through a DIK bank account held under his name (the

âSpecial Accountâ). Dimonâs Regional Financial Director authorized all fund transfers from a

Dimon subsidiaryâs bank account to the Special Account. Dimonâs International Controller
formalized the accounting methodology used to record the payments made from the Special
Account for purposes of internal reporting by Dimon.

3. From 2000 to 2004, Dimon and Standard also paid bribes of more than $1.2
million to government officials of the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly (âTTMâ) in order to obtain
more than $18.3 million in sales contracts. Dimonâs Senior Vice President of Sales directed the

âsales of tobacco from Brazil and Malawi to the TTM through Dimonâs agent in Thailand. In |
connection with the sales, he authorized the payment of bribes to TTM officials and
characterized the payments as commissions paid to Dimonâs agent in Thailand. Similarly,
Standardâs personnel in Brazil and Europe directed the sales of tobacco from Brazil to the TTM
through Standardâs agents in Thailand. Standard personnel authonzed improper payments to
TTM officials and failed to accurately record those payments in Standardâs books and records,

â 4... - By-at least May 2005, Standard provided gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses _
to foreign government officials in the Asian Region, including China and Thailand. In 2004,
Standard made a $50,000 payment to a political candidate who was also Standardâs agent for
tobacco sales in Thailand. | | x |

5 In April 2003, Dimonâs subsidiary in Greece made a payment of $96,000 to a
Greek tax olifieial in exchange for the tax officialâs agreement not to a certain irregularities
discovered during an audit, thus significantly reducing Dimon Greeceâs tax ability. Separately,

the controller of Dimonâs subsidiary in Indonesia made a $44,000 cash payment 6 an Indonesian

tax official in exchange for receiving a tax refund.
6. Despite their extensive international operations, Dimon and Standard lacked
sufficient internal controls desi gned to prevent or detect violations of the FCPA. During the
2000-2004 period, Dimon and Standard each had a policy manual prohibiting bribery, but the
training and guidance provided to their employees regarding compliance with the FCPA were
not adequate or effective. Dimon and Standard each also failed to establish a program to monitor
compliance with the FCPA by its employees, agents, and subsidiaries.

7. Dimon improperly recorded bribes and other improper payments in its books and
records as Selling, General, and Administrative expenses. Standard failed to make and keep
records that accurately reflected its transactions in Thailand and China, including its transactions
with the TTM.

8. By its conduct, defendant Alliance One violated the anti-bribery provision of the
FCPA, Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§
78dd-1], by making or agreeing to make improper payments to foreign government officials in
_ order to obtain or retain business. Defendant Alliance One also violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A).

- and 13(6(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and- FBmo)\B)] by: failing |
to maintain an adequate internal control system to detect and prevent improper payments and by
improperly recording these payments in its books and records. Unless restrained and enjoined by |
the Court, defendant Alliance One will continue to engage in acts and practices that constitute, or â
will constitute, violations of these provisions.

| JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9. This Court has JURISHIEEON over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 8Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa].

10. Venue in the District of Columbia is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Â©

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa].

FACTS
A. Payments To Kyrgyzstan Government Officials

18. In August 1994, Dimon began business operations in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, through
DIK.

19. On September 1, 1996, the Kyrgyzstan government imposed a requirement that
all exporters of fermented tobacco have an export license. The Tamekisi acted as the issuing
authority and controlled the issuance of export licenses, thus effectively controlling all tobacco
purchases in Kyrgyzstan. A high-ranking Tamekisi official had the authority to sign export
licenses. During this time, a Tamekisi official informed DIK that the export licensing
requirement would result in greater competition for DIK from other companies and that

âTamekisi will share in any profit [Dimon] makes.â

20. âUnder Presidential Order; the Tamekisi was responsible for-overseeing the Â°Â° = 5

fermentation of tobacco. The Tamekisi operated state-controlled tobacco fermentation plants
throughout Kyrgyzstan and prohibited private fermentation plants from operating in Kyrgyzstan.
21. On October 2, 1996, Dimon International Inc. (USA), Dimonâs wholly-owned
subsidiary, signed an agreement with the Tamekisi stating, among other things, âThe cost of
services for tobacco fermentation at tobacco plants shall be set up in the amount of $0.18 U.S.
per kg. Apart from that, DIMON shall pay $0.05 U.S. per kg. on the settlement account of the
Kyrgyz party for financial assistance.â The payments for âfinancial assistanceâ were made by
Dimonâs Country Manager in cash to a high-ranking Tamekisi official and had no legitimate

business purpose.
22. | _Dimonâs Country Manager received periodic calls from a hi gh-ranking Tamekisi
official regarding the âfinancial assistanceâ payments and periodically delivered bags filled with
$100 bills to the high-ranking Tamekisi official at the Tamekisiâs office in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.
From 1996 to 2004, Dimonâs Country Manager paid more than $2.6 million to the high-ranking
Tamekisi official. |

| 23. | Dimonâs Country Manager also paid bribes to local government officials in
Kyrgyzstan known as Akims, who controlled the tobacco regions. DIK. needed the support and
consent of each AlÃ©m in order to purchase tobacco from local growers or agricultural collectives.
Akims had the power and influence to prevent the purchase of tobacwo in their respective
regions, even if a company had an export license. Akims could also send the police to block the
entrance to buying stations or install a lock box to prevent the transfer of tobacco.

24. DIK paid Akims approximately $0.01 per kilogram of tobacco it purchased from
growers in each province. From 1996 to 2004, Dimonâs Country Manager authorized and paid

more than $260,000 to the Akims. _

vie 25.0% Dimonâs Country Manager authorized; directed; âand paid thÃ© bribes iGo OE ES

government officials in Kyrgyzstan through a DIK bank account held under his name called the
âSpecial Account. The Special Account was funded by wire transfers from another Dimon
_ subsidiary. These wire transfers were authorized by Dimonâs Regional Financial Director. |
-Dimonâs International Controller formalized the accounting methodology used to record the
improper payments made from the Special Account. Specifically, Dimon recorded these
payments as tobacco inventory in DIKâs balance sheet. As DIKâs tobacco was sold, the cost of
that tobacco and the capitalized expenditures from the Special Account were removed from

inventory and charged to DIKâs cost of goods sold through an amortization process. DIKâs cost
of goods sold was incorporated in Dimonâs consolidated financial statements as cost of goods
sold.
B. Payments to Government Officials Of Thailand

26. From 2000 to 2003, Dimon, and from 2001 to 2004, Standard colluded with
another competitor to pay bribes of mee than $1.2 million to government officials of the TTM
in exchange for obtaining more.than $18.3 million in sales contracts. These sales were made
through Dinan and Standardâs subsidiaries in Brazil, Dimon do Brasil Tabacos Ltda. and
Standard Brazil Limited, respectively. Dimon falsely recorded these payments as commissions
in its books and records, and Standard failed to accurately record these payments in its books and
records.

27.  Dimonâs sales of tobacco from Brazil and Malawi to the TTM were directed and
coordinated by Dimonâs Senior Vice President of Sales in the United States and Dimonâs
personnel in Brazil. Standardâs sales of tobacco from Brazil to the TTM were directed and

coordinated by Standardâs personnel in Brazil and Europe.

""28. A portion of Dimon and Standardâs selling price to the TTM was designatÃ©d on'a*

per kilogram basis as âspecial expensesâ or âspecial commissions,â which were kickbacks paid
through their agents to certain members of the TTM in exchange for the sales contracts. During
the period 2000 through 2003, Dimon made corrupt payments of approximately $542,590 to
TIM government officials. Similarly, from 2001 through 2004, Standard made corrupt
payments of $696,160 to TIM oeverument officials.
Cc. Books and Records and Internal Control Violations
Improper Payments to Tax Officials in Kyrgyzstan
29, DIK. was frequently subjected to audits by Kyrgyz tax officials. The tax

mspections generally lasted about seven weeks and DIK personnel devoted most of their work
| hours to responding to queries from the tax officials. Upon completion of one audit, the Kyrgyz
tax officials would begin performing yet another inspection. During the relevant time period, the
tax authorities reduced the tax penalties levied against DIK in exchange for cash payments.

From 1996 through 2004, Dimon through DIK paid approximately $82,850 to Kyrgyz tax
officials to reduce tax penalties. |

| Improper Gifts And Payments To Government Officials In China And Thailand

30. Between 2000 and 2003, Dimon arranged purported business trips that were
actually sightseeing trips arranged by Dimon and others for TTM officials.

St. By at least May 2005, Standard provided gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses
to government officials in the Asian Region. For example, im 2002 and 2003, contemporaneous
documents show that Standard empllipecs provided watches, cameras, laptop computers, and
other gifts to Chinese and Thailand tobacco officials. Standard also paid for dinner and
sightseeing expenses during non-business related travel to Alaska, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas
for Chinese and Thailand. government delegations.

32> âIn December 2004, Standard paid $50,000 toa political candidate who was also |
Standardâs agent for sabaens sales in Thailand. The $50,000 payment was falsely revered in
Standardâs books as a payment for consulting work,
Improper Payments mn Tax Officials in Greece and Indonesia

33. During a routine internal audit of two Dimon subsidiaries in Greece in May and
June 2003, Dimonâs internal auditors inquired about certain rransections ina miscellaneous |
expense account. Disbursements from this account were labeled âspecial marketing expenses,â
and included a cash payment of $96,000 to a Greek tax official in April 2003 by the country
manager of Dimon Greece. The Greek tax official was conducting an audit of Dimon Greece at

the time of the payment.
34. The cash payment was made in exchange for the Greek tax officialâs agreement
not to pursue over alleged irregularities discovered during the audit. As a result of the payment,
Dimon Greeceâs tax payment was reduced from approximately 2.5 million Euros to
approximately 600,000 Euros. The payment to the Greek tax official was recorded in a
miscellaneous account as part of Dimon Greeceâs Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses, which was incorporated in Dimonâs consolidated financial statements.

35. In July 2004, Indonesian tax authorities initiated an audit of the 2003 tax return of
P.T. Mayangsari, Dimonâs Indonesian subsidiary. Dimon owned 75% of Mayangsari. According
to the tax return, Mayangsari was entitled to receive a refund of $630,375,745 Indonesian Rupiah
(about $68,000) in connection with the overpayment of income and value added taxes. During
the audit, one of the Indonesian supervising tax officials suggested to Mayangsariâs Controller
that Mayangsari resolve the audit by making a cash payment of 410,000,000 Rupiah (about
$44,000) to. the tax official. Mayangsariâs Controller agreed. In August 2004, Mayangsariâs

Controller made the cash payinent to the tax official in exchange for terminating the audit and
 oBtathing'a tax refand df 618Â°591,983 Rupiah (about $67,000)"" -

36. In August 2004, Mayangsariâs Controller recorded the cash payment in
Mayangsariâs books and records as a purchase of tobacco and attributed to Mayangsariâs Selling, ~
General, and Administrative Expenses, which was incorporated in Dimonâs consolidated -
financial statements.

SEC Charges Two Global Tobacco Companies With
Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-144

Washington, D.C., Aug. 6, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged two global tobacco companies with violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for paying more than $5 million in bribes to
government officials in Thailand and other countries to illicitly obtain tobacco
sales contracts.

 

Additional Materials

Â» SEC Complaint v. Universal Corporation
Â®Â» SEC Complaint v. Alliance One
Â® Litigation Release No. 21618

 

The SEC alleges that Richmond, Va.-based Universal Corporation Inc. and two
competitors who have since merged to form Alliance One International Inc.
engaged in a coordinated bribery scheme in Thailand. Universal paid
approximately $800,000 in bribes to officials with the government-owned
Thailand Tobacco Monopoly (TTM) in exchange for securing approximately
$11.5 million worth of tobacco sales contracts for its subsidiaries in Brazil and
Europe. The companies that became Alliance One â Dimon Inc. and Standard
Commercial Corporation â paid more than $1.2 million in bribes to TTM
officials to obtain more than $18.3 million in sales contracts.

The SEC further alleges that Dimon and Standard (now Alliance One) made
improper payments in China, Greece, Indonesia, and Kyrgyzstan while failing
to properly record the true nature of the payments in its accounting records.
Universal made improper payments in Malawi and Mozambique and failed to
properly record them in their books and records.

To settle the SEC's charges against them, Universal agreed to pay
disgorgement of more than $4.5 million and Morrisville, N.C.-based Alliance
One agreed to pay $10 million in disgorgement. Universal agreed to pay a
criminal fine of $4.4 million and Alliance One agreed to pay a criminal fine of
$9.45 million in separate criminal proceedings announced today by the U.S.
Department of Justice.

""These large tobacco merchants used secret payments to improperly win
business and curry favor with foreign government officials around the globe,""
said Christopher Conte, Associate Director in the SEC's Division of
Enforcement.

In separate complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, the SEC alleges that Universal and Alliance One violated the anti-
bribery, books and records, and internal control provisions of the FCPA
through their misconduct, which began as early as 1996 in Kyrgyzstan. The
bribery scheme in Thailand took place between 2000 and 2004.

According to the SEC's complaint, Universal also made a series of payments
from 2004 to 2007 to government officials in Mozambique through corporate
subsidiaries in Belgium and Africa. Universal made these payments â totaling
more than $165,000 â primarily to secure an exclusive right to purchase
tobacco from regional growers and procure legislation beneficial to the
company's business. Between 2002 and 2003, Universal subsidiaries paid a
total of $850,000 to high-ranking Malawian government officials that were not
accurately recorded in Universal's books and records.

The SEC's complaint alleges that a Dimon subsidiary â Dimon International
Kyrgyzstan (DIK) â paid more than $3 million in bribes to Kyrgyzstan
government officials to purchase Kyrgyz tobacco for resale to Dimon's
customers. Most of these payments were delivered in bags filled with $100
bills to a high-ranking government official. DIK also made improper payments
to Kyrgyzstan tax officials.

Dimon also made improper payments to tax officials in Greece and Indonesia,
according to the SEC's complaint. Standard made an improper payment to a
political candidate and provided gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses to
foreign government officials in Asia, including China and Thailand. Dimon and
Standard failed to accurately record these payments in the companies' books
and records.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Universal and Alliance
One consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining each of
them from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal control
provisions of the FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition to paying disgorgement,
each company has agreed to retain an independent monitor for three years.
The proposed settlements are subject to court approval.

In the related criminal proceedings, the Justice Department filed criminal
actions against a Universal subsidiary and two Alliance One subsidiaries
charging each of them with one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and
one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Universal and
Alliance One have entered into non-prosecution agreements with the DO] to
pay the criminal penalties and retain independent monitors for a period of
three years.

The SEC charged four former Dimon employees earlier this year for their roles
in the scheme. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Amybeth Garcia-
Bokor, Paul Gumagay, Michael Hoess, Uta Von Eckartsberg, and Christine
Neal. The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the
Department of Justice's Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

FACTS

I. The Mexican Bribery Scheme

12. ABB Network Management (âABB NMâ) is a Sugar Land, Texas based
business unit of ABB Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of ABB Ltd, which provides products and
services to electric utilities for managing power generation and transmission networks.
ABB acquired ABB NM, formerly known as Bailey Network Management, in its -
corporate acquisition of Elsag Bailey Process Automation N.V., in early 1999.
Between 1997 and 2004, ABB NM and its corporate predecessor, paid over $1.9 million
in bribes to government officials and others in Mexico to obtain and retain business with
two government owned electric utilities, Comision Federal de Electricidad CEEâ) arid ;
Luz y Fuerza del Centro (âLyFZâ).. The bribes were funneled through Mexican Company
X,ABB NMâs agent in MexiÃ©o; and two ther companies in Mexico, Intermediary
Company S and Intermediary- Company 0. ABB, which failed to conduct any. due
diligence on the use or payments to this agent and other companies, improperly recorded
the illicit payments on its books as payments for commissions and services on the
projects. Asa result of this scheme, ABB NM was awarded contracts with CFE and
LyFZ that generated over $90 million in revenues and $13 million in profits for ABB.

13. | CFE isa utility owned by the government of Mexico that supplies
electricity to over 26 million customers in Mexico. The offer and payment of bribes to
government officials at CFE dates back to at least 1997, prior to acquisition by ABB, and

involved a project called SITRACEN. The SITRACEN contract involved a

comprehensive upgrade of networking systems at CFEâs national control center, the
emergency backup control center, eight area control centers, and eight subarea control
centers. At the time ABB NMâs predecessor was bidding on this contract, it agreed to
pay bribes to CFE officials to obtain the contract. CFE awarded the contract to ABB
NMâs predecessor in December 1997. The project lasted through 2001 and generated
more than $40 million in revenues for ABB.

14. From 1997 through 2001, ABB NM (and its predecessor) made at least
$913,876.70 in illicit payments in connection with the SITRACEN project. The bribes
were paid through Mexican Company X and Intermediary Company S, and falsely
recorded in ABBâs books as payments for commissions and local services. ABB NM
paid at least $108,000 to CFE officials or their designees through Mexican Company X,
and paid at least another $805,876 to CFE officials or their designees through âe
Intermediary Company S. ,

15. In 2003, ABB NM agreed. to pay over $5 million in bribes to CFE officials
to obtain a contract with CFE for another large project called EVERGREEN. Â»
EVERGREEN was a contract to maintain and upgrade CFEâs networking systems. ABB
NM agreed to pay the bribes to CFE officials over the course of the contract through
phony invoices submitted by Mexican Company X, Intermediary Company S and
Intermediary Company O.

, 16. ABB Inc. had to obtain approval from ABB to execute the EVERGREEN
contract due to the contractâs size and certain contractual terms. During that approval
process, ABB failed to conduct any due diligence on the use or payment terms with the
local agent, Mexican Company X, or other companies to be used in connection with the

project.
17. In October 2003, CFE awarded ABB NM the EVERGREEN contract.
The project lasted through 2007, and ultimately generated approximately $37 million in
revenues for ABB. As part of the bribery scheme, ABB NM also was awarded other
smaller contracts with CFE and another government owned utility, LyFZ.

18. In 2003 and 2004, ABB NM paid at least $984,078 in bribes to CFE
officials or their designees in connection with the EVERGREEN project. The bribes
were paid through Mexican Company X, Intermediary Company S, and Intermediary
Company O, which submitted invoices to ABB NM for phony local services. Despite the
amount and volume of the payments, and the fact that certain of the payments were made
not to the companies submitting invoices but to the personal bank accounts of
individuals, ABB failed to conduct any review of these payments.

Examples of the Illicit Payments

19. ABB NM funneled bribery payments to CFE officials through its agent in
Mexico, Mexican Company X. With the SITRACEN project, ABB NM funneled the
bribes through Mexican Company X as purported commission payments. With the
EVERGREEN contract, ABB NM funneled the bribes through Mexican Company X as
purported payments for local services, for which Mexican Company X submitted phony
invoices to ABB NM. At times, principals of Mexican Company X paid cash bribes
directly to CFE officials and at other times wrote checks or wired money to individuals or
accounts designated by the CFE officials. The following are examples of the illicit
payments:

20. As part of the bribery scheme, in 2000, a principal of Mexican Company

X issued twelve $9,000 checks from a U.S. bank account to the daughter of a CFE
official. The checks were deposited into an account in her name at a financial institution
in the U.S.

21. As part of the bribery scheme, in 2004, principals of Mexican Company
X, in a series of transactions, wired from their U.S. bank account $197,581 to a U.S.
brokerage account designated by a CFE official. At least $99,912 of this money was
subsequently wired from this U.S. brokerage account to a U.S. bank account in the name
of a daughter and son-in-law of a CFE official.

22. As part of the bribery scheme, in 2004, a principal of Mexican Company
X, through a series of transactions, withdrew.approximately $27,000 in cash from his.
personal bank accounts, and paid approximately $20,000 of this cash to'âa CFE official in
Houston, Texas. =

23... As part of the bribery scheme, in 2004, Mexican Company X submitted a
$25,000 invoice to ABB NM for purported local services, which ABB NM paid. This
invoice was fraudulent as Mexican Company X had provided no such services. The.
invoice was submitted at the direction of ABB NM in order to pay for a Mediterranean
cruise vacation for two CFE officials and their wives. ~

24. As part of the bribery scheme, in 2004, Mexican Company X submitted a
$10,000 invoice to ABB NM for purported local services, which ABB NM paid. This
invoice was fraudulent as Mexican Company X had provided no such services. The
invoice was submitted at the direction of ABB NM in order to reimburse Mexican
Company X for a cash bribe paid to a CFE official.

25. Additionally, as part of the bribery scheme, from 1998 through 2004, ABB

NM paid Intermediary Company S at least $1,074,676 in connection with the
SITRACEN and EVERGREEN projects, and in 2004, paid Intermediary Company O at
least $403,200 in connection with the EVERGREEN project. These two entities
submitted phony invoices to ABB NM, through Mexican Company X, for purported
services rendered. These entities provided no legitimate services to ABB NM. These
payments were part of the scheme to funnel bribes to CFE officials.

26. For example, in March 2004, Mexican Company X received invoices from
Intermediary Company S and Intermediary Company O for $218,000 and $327,000,
respectively. Mexican Company X forwarded these invoices, with payment instructions,
to ABB NM. ABB NM paid the invoices by wiring funds to Intermediary Company Sâs
bank account in Germany, and to Intermediary Company Oâs bank account in Mexico.
Shortly thereafter, Intermediary Company S wired $29,539 toms its account in atts

. to.aU.S. bank account of a private military school in Wisconsin, to pay tuition for. the son
of a CFE official, and wired an additional $10,018 directly to a U.S. bank account of
another CFE official. a

Kickbacks To The Former General Manager of ABB NM

27. Inconnection with the bribery scheme iri Mexico, the principals of
Mexican Company X paid more than $100,000 in kickbacks to the former general
manager of ABB NM. Some of the kickbacks were in cash, while others were paid by
check. During the period 2002 through 2004 alone, the principals of Mexican Company
X delivered to the former ABB NM general manager at least 24 checks totaling
$108,942. At the general managerâs direction, the payees on these checks included the

general manager, his family and friends, and his credit card company.
I. The Embezzlement Scheme at ABB NM

28. Between 2002 and 2004, the former general manager of ABB NM and Ali
Hozhabri, a former project manager for ABB NM, embezzled $468,714 from-the
company. They carried out the scheme by requesting and authorizing cash and check
disbursements to pay fictional expenses on contracts ABB NM had with Itaipu
Binancional (âITAIPUâ), an entity owned by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay
that operates a hydroelectric dam, and âwith Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil
Operations (âADCOâ), a division of a government owned company that provides
electrical power in the United Arab Emirates.

, The ITAIPU Contract

29. In 2000, as a result of. a corporate. acquisition by ABB, ABB.NM enanie
performance of a $6.9 million contract to provide products and. services to ITAIPU.
Between 2002 and 2004, the former gelieral manager of ABB NM and Hozhabri
embezzled nearly $330,000 in connection with-the ITAIPU contract. :

30. Under that contract, ABB NM was permitted to adjust previously
submitted invoices to ITAIPU to account for inflation according to a formula specified in
the contract. At the general managerâs direction, Hozhabri, the project manager on the
contract, prepared and submitted to ITAIPU approximately $330,000 in âreadjustmentâ
invoices. When ITAIPU paid ABB NM on these invoices, Hozhabri then submitted
fraudulent requests to ABB NM for disbursements to pay fictitious expenses associated
with the ITAIPU contract. The disbursement requests identified the expenses as
âcommissionsâ or âlocal works.â The general manager then authorized ABB NMâs

controller to approve these disbursements so that Hozhabri could take cash to Brazil to
pay these purported local expenses. The money was not used to pay local expenses in
Brazil, but instead was split between the general manager and Hozhabri and kept for their
personal use.

The ADCO Contract

31. In 2000, as a result of the same corporate acquisition by ABB, ABB NM
assumed performance of a $5.9 million contract to provide products and services to
ADCO. Hozhabri also was the ABB NM project manager on this contract. In 2002 and
2003, ABB NMâs former general manager and Hozhabri embezzled approximately
$145,800 in connection. with this contract.

32. The ADCO contract had various change orders through which ABB NM
provided additional products and services to ADCO. ABB NM, through an ABB
subsidiary in Abu Dhabi, submitted invoices to ADCO. for these change orders. When.
ADCO paid certain of these invoices, Hozhabri, at the general managerâs direction,
submitted fraudulent requests to ABB NM for cash and checks to âpay âphony -
âsubcontractor feesâ in connection with those change orders. The ABB NM general
manager then authorized the ABB NM controller to approve these disbursements so that
Hozhabri could take cash to Abu Dhabi to pay these purported subcontractor fees. The
money was not used to pay local subcontractors in Abu Dhabi, but instead was split

between Hozhabri and the general manager and kept for their personal use.

iil. The Oil for Food Scheme
A. Background on the United Nations Oil for Food Program

33. The Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for
the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under the international trade sanctions
that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Program permitted the Iraqi
government to sell its crude oil and use the proceeds to purchase food, medicine, and
critical infrastructure supplies.

34. The proceeds of the oil sales were transferred directly from the buyers to
an escrow account (the âU.N. Escrow Accountâ) maintained in New York by the United
Nations 661 Committee. Funds in the U.N. Escrow Account were available for the
purchase of humanitarian supplies, subject to U.N. approval and supervision. The intent
of this.structure was to prevent the proceeds of Traqâs crude oil sales froth undermining
the sanctions regime by supplying cash to Saddam Hussein. ,

35. Corruption was rampant within the Program. -By: âmid-2000, Iraqi
ministries, on the instruction of top government officials, instituted a policy requiring
suppliers of humanitarian goods to pay a ten percent kickback on each contract. This
kickback requirement was euphemistically referred to as an âafter sales service feeâ
(âASSFâ); however, no services were provided. Suppliers competing to obtain contracts
under the Program were encouraged to include a ten percent markup in their bids or
purchase orders.

36. The inflated contract prices were incorporated into the Oil for Food
contracts as a way to permit the suppliers to recover from the U.N. Escrow Account the

kickback payments they had paid secretly to Iraq. Following the 2004 release of a report

ll
by the U.S. General Accounting Office exposing some of the abuses, the U.N.
commissioned an independent inquiry committee, headed by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker (the âVolcker Committeeâ), to investigate the Programâs
performance. That committeeâs October 27, 2005, final report estimated that the Iraqi
government had diverted $1.7 billion in illicit income from the Program.

B. ABBâs Involvement in the Oil for Food Program

37. From approximately 2000 to 2004, ABB participated in the Oil for Food
Program through six of its subsidiaries: ABB Ltd Jordan (âABB Jordanâ), ABB
Automation, ABB. Industrie AC Machines.and ABB Selyvent-Ventec (collectively
referred to as âABB Franceâ), ABB AG (âABB Austriaâ) and ABB Elektrik Sanayi AS
(âABB Turkeyâ). The six subsidiaries developed warlous schemes to pay secret ;
kickbacks to Iraq in order to obtain contracts. The kickbacks were characterized as after.
sales service fees but in reality they were nothing more than bribes paid to the Traqi

âregime.

38. Kickbacks of approximately $810,793 were paid in connection with the
subsidiariesâ sales of goods on twenty-seven contracts with promises to pay additional
kickbacks of $239,501 on three other contracts. The total revenues on the contracts were
approximately $13,577,727 and profits were $3,801,367. ABB improperly disguised the
ASSFs on its books and records by mischaracterizing them as legitimate after sales
services, consultation costs or commissions.

ABB Jordan
39. ABB designated ABB Jordan as the entity with authorization to facilitate

sales to Iraq for ABB subsidiaries. ABB Jordan paid kickbacks to Iraq on various ABB

12
Jordan contracts, as well as on contracts awarded to other ABB subsidiaries. In
particular, from approximately August 2001 to June 2002, ABB Jordan paid illicit ASSFs
of approximately $309,484 in connection with eleven ABB Jordan contracts for the sale
of switchyard equipment to the Iraqi Electricity Commission and the Commissionâs
regional company, the Baghdad Mayoralty, all government entities. ABB Jordan also
agreed to pay a 10% ASSF on one other Oil for Food contract but the U.N. had ABB
amend the contract to remove the ASSF amount before it was paid.

40.  Inearly 2001 the General âManager of ABBâs Baghdad office began
receiving repeated verbal and written requests from officials within the Iraqi government
for the payment of 10% fees on all Oil for Food contracts. In March 2001, the Baghdad
General Manager and an ABB Jordan employee traveled to Zurich, Switzerland, to siet
with ABBâs Group Export Control (âGECâ) about the payment demands. The GEC was
the ABB group responsible for monitoring all exports to Iraq. ABB employees who
traveled to Zurich in 2001 alleged that GEC authorized them to pay the kickbacks. GEC
personnel, however, alleged that no such approvals were provided. After the GEC
approvals were allegedly obtained, the ABB Jordan employees inflated their Oil for Food
contract bids by approximately 10% to cover the cost of the kickbacks they intended to
pay to Iraq. The artificially inflated contracts were then provided to the UN for approval.
At no time did ABB notify the UN that it was secretly paying ASSFs to Iraq. Proof of
the payments was found in certain ABB documents. For example, ABB Jordanâs internal
project costs documentation referred to the kickbacks as legitimate costs for âafter sales
services,â âconsultation costsâ or âtraining.â ABB Jordan used bank guarantees to make

the first two ASSF payments to the Baghdad Mayoralty.

13
41. | The subsequent nine ASSFs were paid in cash and hand deliveted by the
General Manager of ABB Jordan to a designated official at the Iraqi Electricity
Commission. ABB Jordan received written receipts of the kickbacks paid in cash to the
designated official. ABB Jordanâs profits from all twelve contracts, including the
contract where a kickback was promised but not paid, were $970,276.

ABB France

42. From approximately 2000 to 2002, ABB France entered into six contracts
for the sale of electrical accessories and equipment to the Iraqi Electricity Commission
and the Ministry of Industry and- Minerals in which kickbacks of approximately $244,844
were paid. ABB France used French Agent, a French company. headquartered in Paris, as
its local agent.in Iraq to facilitate each of the sales. The French Agent, submitted tender ona
offers.on behalf of ABB France and negotiated.contract terms with the agi customers.
The use of the French Agent violated ABBâs internal policies and procedures, which
required all contacts with Iraq to be-handled by ABB Jordan. The Jordan office was the
only ABB subsidiary authorized to deal with customers in Iraq, and agents could not be
used unless specifically authorized by ABB Jordan. ABBâs company policy also
required all contracts with Iraq to be reviewed and approved by GEC in Zurich,
Switzerland. Despite this, there is no indication that ABB France ever approached GEC
for approval of any of its Oil for Food contracts. In addition, ABB could not locate any
written agency agreement with the French Agent, and it could not substantiate the
performance of any legitimate business services by the French Agent. Records show that

ABB France paid the French agent commissions of anywhere from 2.5% to 17% on the

Oil for Food contracts, with an average commission of 9%.

14
43. An April 2002 receipt shows a payment of $10,000 by ABB France to the
Iraqi Commission of Electricity in connection with a 2001 OFFP contract. In connection
with another 2000 OFFP contract, a July 2000 handwritten internal document references
a payment of 20,000 euros, and described the payment as a â10% commission for the
Iraqi government.â The document was likely prepared by ABBâs former area sales
manager for ABB France.

44. | From approximately March 2000 to at least February 21, 2002, ABB
France used the French Agent as a distributor to facilitate five additional contract sales to
Iraq. The French: Agent purchased goods directly from ABB France âfor its own account.
The French Agent, in turn, then sold ABB Franceâs products to Iraq and submitted its .
own inflated contracts to.the U; N. -Thus, ABB France was no longer.the party named. on...
the inflated contracts.to the-U.Ns Asa result, ABB was able to move its goods into Traq;
but keep itself distanced from any. involvement in the ASSF F scheme. The French Agent
paid kickbacks of approximately $92,805 on the contracts. ABB France paid the French
Agent fees through the use of performance bonds and bid bonds on the contracts that
equaled approximately 10% of the contract value. The French agent used these
additional payments from ABB France to pay kickbacks to Iraq. Altogether, ABB France
obtained profits of $768,584 on the eleven contracts.

ABB Austria

45. ABB Jordan also facilitated kickbacks paid on behalf of ABB Austria.

From approximately 2000 to 2002, ABB Austria entered into three contracts for the sale

of electronic and switchyard equipment to the Iraqi Electricity Commission in which

kickbacks of $3,865 were paid. ABB Austria submitted the contract bids to Iraq on

1S
behalf of ABB Utility Automation GmBH, (ââDEUTAâ), a German subsidiary of ABB
Ltd. DEUTA prepared the bids for ABB Austria, which then forwarded them to ABB
Jordan. The ABB Jordan employee responsible for submitting the DEUTA bids to Iraq
acknowledged that gay ment of a 10% surcharge was the prevalent practice in the market
and that ABB was told that 1f it did not pay kickbacks it would not get any business from
Iraq. The employee acknowledged that a 10% increase between the bid and purchase
order price on one ABB Austria contract could have related to an ASSF fee to Iraq. ABB:
Austriaâs profits on the three contracts were $8,386.

. ABB Turkey Â©

46. Similar to Austria, ABB Jordan facilitated kickbacks pate on behalf of

: | ABB Turkey. From approximately: 2001 to Â» 2002, ABB Turkey entered into two contracts. non Â¢

~ with the Ministry of Oil Economics sand F Finance Department (*MOEFDâ). on n which
kickbacks of a1 59, 795 were aid After ABB Turkey s submitted Pai for contracts, s Tragi | |
officials would demand that pibibacks tes added to the price of the Â¢ contracts. ABB |
Turkey was notified that it would not receive any contracts if it did not agree to the .
kickback scheme. The secretly inflated contract prices were submitted to the UN for
approval. There are two April 2001 side agreements, signed by ABB Turkey, to pay _
kickbacks to the Iraqi North Oil Company in connection with the MOEFD contracts
described above. There are additional side agreements signed by ABB Turkey, in which
ABB Turkey authorized, but did not pay, $239,501 in improper ASSF payments in
connection with three additional contracts.â Despite the fact that ABB Turkey had

entered into written side agreements to pay the kickbacks, ABB Turkey sent a letter to the

 

: Because the sale was not completed and the ASSF was not paid by the time of the U.S. invasion of
Iraq in March 2003, the UN required that ABB Turkey amend its contract price to remove the ASSF.

16
Volcker Committee on September 1, 2005, indicating that â[w]e have gone through our
records and reviewed our files, and our findings show no unauthorized payments to the
Iraqi government under the scope of this programme.â ABB Turkeyâs profits from all
five contracts were $2,052,121.

IV. ABB Committed Anti-Bribery, Internal Controls, and Books and Records
Violations

47. ABB, through its U.S. subsidiary, made millions of dollars in illicit
payments and promised payments, either-directly or indirectly, to Mexican government
officials to obtain or retain business. ABB made use of U.S. mails and interstate
commerce to cairy out the scheme.

48. - -Inconnection with all of the illicit payments in Mexico and Iraq, and theâ
payments that were part of the embezzlement scheme, ABB failed to make and keep :
accurate books, records and accounts. The bribes.and other illicit payments were
improperly recorded as legitimate âcommissions or other expenses in ABBâs-books and ,
records.

49. Moreover, as evidenced by the extent and duration of the illicit payments
to foreign officials, the large number of ABB subsidiaries involved in these bribery and
kickback schemes, ABBâs knowledge from the prior Commission action of illicit
payments by other ABB subsidiaries, the improper recording of millions of dollars of
illicit payments in ABBâs books and records, ABBâs failure to detect these irregularities,
and ABBâs failure to conduct sufficient due diligence on local agents and others, ABB
failed to devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect

these anti-bribery and books and records violations.

SEC Charges ABB For Bribery Schemes in Mexico and
Iraq

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-175

 

Washington, D.C., Sept. 29, 2010 â The
Securities and Exchange Commission today High-Res Photo
charged ABB Ltd with violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for using
subsidiaries to pay bribes to Mexican officials
to obtain business with government-owned
power companies, and to pay kickbacks to
Iraq to obtain contracts under the U.N. Oil for
Food Program.

 

Additional Materials

Â®Â» SEC Complaint
Â» Litigation Release No. 21673

 

 

The SEC alleges that ABB's subsidiaries made

at least $2.7 million in illicit payments in âThere are significant
these schemes to obtain contracts that consequences for public
generated more than $100 million in companies that fail to
revenues for ABB, a Swiss corporation that implement strong

compliance programs and
prevent corrupt payments
to government officials.â

provides power and automation products and
services worldwide.

ABB has agreed to pay more than $39.3 Scott W. Friestad
million to settle the SEC's charges. Associate Director

SEC Enforcement
""This investigation uncovered millions of Division

 

 

dollars in bribes paid or promised to officials
at Mexico's largest power company,"" said
Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""As
the sanctions in this case demonstrate, there are significant consequences for
public companies that fail to implement strong compliance programs and
prevent corrupt payments to government officials.

 

Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit,
added, ""ABB's violations involved conduct at a U.S. subsidiary and six foreign-
based subsidiaries. Multi-national companies that make illicit payments
through layers of subsidiaries will be held accountable.""

The SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that
from 1999 to 2004, ABB Network Management (ABB NM) â a business unit
within ABB's U.S. subsidiary â bribed officials in Mexico to obtain and retain
business with two government owned electric utilities, Comision Federal de
Electricidad (CFE) and Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LyFZ). The bribes were
funneled through ABB NM's agent and two other companies in Mexico. The
SEC alleges that ABB failed to conduct due diligence on these payments and
entities and improperly recorded the bribes on its books as payments for
commissions and services on projects in Mexico. Illicit payments included
checks and wire transfers to relatives of CFE officials, cash bribes to CFE
officials, and a Mediterranean cruise vacation for CFE officials and their wives.
As a result of this bribery scheme, ABB NM was awarded contracts with CFE
and LyFZ that generated more than $90 million in revenues and $13 million in
profits for ABB.

The SEC alleges that from approximately 2000 to 2004, ABB participated in
the U.N. Oil for Food Program through six subsidiaries that developed various
schemes to pay secret kickbacks to the former regime in Iraq to obtain
contracts under the program. ABB's Jordanian subsidiary acted as a conduit
for other ABB subsidiaries by making the kickback payments on their behalf.
Some of the kickbacks were made in the form of bank guarantees and cash
payments. ABB improperly recorded these kickbacks on its books as
legitimate payments for after sales services, consultation costs, and
commissions. Oil for Food contracts obtained as a result of the kickback
schemes generated $13.5 million in revenues and $3.8 million in profits for
ABB.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, ABB
consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the
company from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, orders the company to pay
$17,141,474 in disgorgement, $5,662,788 in prejudgment interest, anda
$16,510,000 penalty. The order also requires the company to comply with
certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program.

In related criminal proceedings, ABB has reached a settlement with the U.S.
Department of Justice in which ABB has agreed to pay $19 million in criminal
penalties.

Brian O. Quinn, Tracy L. Price, and Denise Hansberry conducted the SEC's
investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the
Department of Justice's Criminal Division-Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the U.N. Independent Inquiry Committee.

SEC Charges Seven Oil Services and Freight Forwarding
Companies for Widespread Bribery of Customs Officials

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-214

Washington, D.C., Nov. 4, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced sweeping settlements with global freight forwarding
company Panalpina, Inc. and six other companies in the oil services industry
that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying millions of
dollars in bribes to foreign officials to receive preferential treatment and
improper benefits during the customs process.

 

SEC Complaints:

Â® Panalpina, Inc.

Â® Pride International, Inc.
Â» Tidewater Inc.

Â®Â» Transocean, Inc.

Â» GlobalSantaFe Corp.

Â» Noble Corporation

SEC Administrative Proceeding:
Â» Royal Dutch Shell ple

 

 

 

The SEC alleges that the companies bribed customs officials in more than 10
countries in exchange for such perks as avoiding applicable customs duties on
imported goods, expediting the importation of goods and equipment,
extending drilling contracts, and lowering tax assessments. The companies
also paid bribes to obtain false documentation related to temporary import
permits for oil drilling rigs, and enable the release of drilling rigs and other
equipment from customs officials.

The SEC's cases were coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud
Section, and the sanctions to be paid by the companies under the settlements
total $236.5 million. This is the first sweep of a particular industrial sector in
order to crack down on public companies and third parties who are paying
bribes abroad.

""Bribing customs officials is not only illegal but also bad for business, as the
coordinated efforts of law enforcement increase the risk of detection every
day,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.
""These companies resorted to lucrative arrangements behind the scenes to
obtain phony paperwork and special favors, and they landed themselves
squarely in investigatorsâ crosshairs.""

Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit,
added, ""This investigation was the culmination of proactive work by the SEC
and DO} after detecting widespread corruption in the oil services industry. The
FCPA Unit will continue to focus on industry-wide sweeps, and no industry is
immune from investigation.""

Without admitting or denying the allegations, the companies agreed to settle
the SEC's charges against them by paying approximately $80 million in
disgorgement, interest, and penalties. The companies agreed to pay fines of
$156.5 million to settle the criminal proceedings with DOJ.

SEC charges against six companies were filed in federal court, and one
company was charged in an SEC administrative proceeding. Among the SEC's
allegations:

Panalpina, Inc. â A U.S. subsidiary of the Swiss freight forwarding giant
Panalpina World Transport (Holding) Ltd. (PWT), Panalpina is charged with
paying bribes to customs officials around the world from 2002 to 2007 on
behalf of its customers, some of whom are included in these settlements.
Panalpina bribed customs officials in Nigeria, Angola, Brazil, Russia and
Kazakhstan to enable importation of goods into those countries and the
provision of logistics services. The bribes were often authorized by Panalpina's
customers and then inaccurately described in customer invoices as ""local
processing"" or ""special intervention"" or ""special handling"" fees.

e Panalpina agreed to an injunction and will pay disgorgement of
$11,329,369 in the SEC case.
e PWT and Panalpina agreed to pay a criminal fine of $70.56 million.

Pride International, Inc. â One of the world's largest offshore drilling
companies, Pride and its subsidiaries paid approximately $2 million to foreign
officials in eight countries from 2001 to 2006 in exchange for various benefits
related to oil services. For example, Pride's former country manager in
Venezuela authorized bribes of approximately $384,000 to a state-owned oil
company official to secure extensions of drilling contracts, and a French
subsidiary of Pride paid $500,000 in bribes intended for a judge to influence
customs litigation relating to the importation of a drilling rig.

e Pride agreed to an injunction and will pay disgorgement and
prejudgment interest of $23,529,718 in the SEC case.

e Pride and subsidiary Pride Forasol agreed to pay a criminal fine of
$32.625 million.

Tidewater Inc. â The New Orleans-based shipping company through a
subsidiary reimbursed approximately $1.6 million to its customs broker in
Nigeria from 2002 to 2007 so the broker could make improper payments to
Nigerian customs officials and induce them to disregard regulatory
requirements related to the importation of Tidewater's vessels.

e Tidewater agreed to an injunction and will pay $8,104,362 in
disgorgement and a $217,000 penalty.

e Tidewater Marine International agreed to pay a criminal fine of $7.35
million.

Transocean, Inc. â An international provider of offshore drilling services to
oil companies throughout the world, Transocean made illicit payments from at
least 2002 to 2007 through its customs agents to Nigerian government
officials in order to extend the temporary importation status of its drilling rigs.
Bribes also were paid to obtain false paperwork associated with its drilling rigs
and obtain inward clearance authorizations for its rigs and a bond registration.

e Transocean agreed to an injunction and will pay disgorgement and
prejudgment interest of $7,265,080.

e Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. agreed to pay a criminal fine of
$13.44 million.

GlobalSantaFe Corp. (GSF) A provider of offshore drilling services GSF made
illegal payments through its customs brokers from approximately 2002 to
2007 to officials of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) to secure
documentation showing that its rigs had left Nigerian waters. The rigs had in
fact never moved. GSF also made other payments to government officials in
Gabon, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea.

e GSF agreed to an injunction and will pay disgorgement of $3,758,165
and a penalty of $2.1 million.

Noble Corporation â An offshore drilling services provider, Noble
authorized payments by its Nigerian subsidiary to its custom agent to obtain
false documentation from NCS officials to show export and re-import of its
drilling rigs into Nigerian waters. From 2003 to 2007, Noble obtained eight
temporary import permits with false documentation.

e Noble agreed to an injunction and will pay disgorgement and
prejudgment interest of $5,576,998.
e Noble agreed to pay a criminal fine of $2.59 million.

Royal Dutch Shell plc â An oil company headquartered in the Netherlands,
Shell and its indirect subsidiary called Shell International Exploration and
Production, Inc. (SIEP) violated the FCPA by using a customs broker to make
payments from 2002 to 2005 to officials at NCS to obtain preferential customs
treatment related to a project in Nigeria.

e SIEP and Shell agreed to a cease-and-desist order and will pay
disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $18,149,459.

e Shell Nigerian Exploration and Production Co. Ltd. will pay a criminal
fine of $30 million.

Washington, D.C, 20549-50308 . | ee cee : Helle Ellen S.
* Plaintiff, Description: General Civil
_VS.. COMPLAINT
RAE SYSTEMS INC. . |
Defendant.

 

Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ)

alleges:
SUMMARY

1. From 2004 through 2008, RAE Systems Inc. (ââRAEâ or the âCompanyâ)
violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the âFCPAâ) by paying, through two
of its joint venture entities in China, approximately $400,000 to third party agents and
government officials in China to influence acts or decisions by foreign officials to obtain
or retain business for RAE. These payments were made primarily by the direct sales
force utilized by RAE at its two Chinese joint-venture entities, named RAE-KLH
(Beijing) Co., Limited (âRAE-KLHâ) and RAE Coal Mine Safety Instruments (Fushun)
Co., Ltd. (âRAE-Fushunâ). | |

2. RAEâs illicit payments to government officials and third-party agents
generated revenues worth over $3 million and gross margin of $1,147,800. The
Company had inadequate controls to prevent or detect any of these improper payments,
and improperly recorded the payments in its books and records. |

3, While the payments were made exclusively in China and were conducted

by Chinese employees of RAE-KLH and RAE-Fushun, RAE was aware of significant
indications of ongoing bribery at RAE-KLH.. At the time, RAE failed to effectively
investigate these indications, or red flags, and to stop the bribery from continuing.
RAEâs failure to act on these significant red flags allowed, at least in part, bribery to
continue at RAE-KLH.

4. RAE violated Section 30A [15 U.S.C. Â§78dd-1] of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) by corruptly making, through its joint-venture
entities, illicit payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain
business. RAE also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) [15 U.S.C. Â§78m(b)(2)] of the
Exchange Act by failing to have an adequate internal control system in place to detect
and prevent the illicit payments, and violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) [15 U.S.C.

Â§78(b)(2)(A)] of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the paymentsâin its books

and records.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Exchange Act

Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].

6. In connection with the conduct described herein, RAE made use of the
mails or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce.

DEFENDANT

7. RAE is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Jose, CA. RAE
develops and manufactures rapidly-deployable, multi-sensor chemical and radiation
detection monitors and networks for the global market. RAE has significant operations in
the Peopleâs Republic of China (âChinaâ), which are organized under RAE Asia,
headquartered in Hong Kong. RAEâs common stock is registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the NYSE Alternext US

Exchange.
OTHER ENTITIES
; 8. RAE-KLH is a joint venture headquartered in Beijing, China. In 2004,
RAE acquired a 64% stake in KLH, which then became known as RAE-KLH. In June
2006, RAE negotiated the purchase of an additional 32% stake in RAE-KLH, for a total

ownership stake of approximately 96%. Today, RAE-KLH remains a joint venture, with

- , its former sole owner, the Beijing Academy of Sciences, owning 4% of the stock.

9. RAE-Fushun is a joint venture based in Fushun, Liaoning Province,
China. In December 2006, RAE acquired a 70% interest in Fushun, and became known
as RAE-Fushun. The.other 30% is owned by the Liaoning Coal Industry Group Co. Ltd.

FACTS

RAEâs Due Diligence of KLH Uncovers Existing Bribery Practices

10. In 2004, RAE began evaluating possible acquisition or business
combinations in China and entered into negotiations with KLH. RAEâs due diligence
uncovered the following facts:

a. KLHâs primary clients were large state-owned enterprises and government
departments. :

b. KLH sales personnel historically financed their sales activities and sales-
related travel throughout mainland China using cash advances and
reimbursements.

c. KLH sales personnel often obtained cash advances from KLHâs
Accounting Department and used such cash advances to bribe government
officials in order to obtain or retain business.

11. RAE also learned through its due diligence that KLH sales personnel were
required to submit a business expense claim form detailing how each cash advance was
spent. In addition, in order to write off sales expenses for tax accounting purposes, KLH
sales personnel were required to obtain government-issued tax.receipts, known as

âfapiaoâ for all sales expenses.
12. KLH sales personnel, however, often failed to list the true items on which
they spent their cash advances. In fact, when fapiao were unavailable or insufficient to
cover the expenses incurred, KLH sales personnel often submitted substitute fapiaoâthat
is, fapiao that were genuine but that were not issued for the specific expense incurred. As
a result, the records of cash advances and reimbursements at RAE-KLH often lacked
adequate support for the purported business purpose.

13.. Upon receiving submission of the fapiao, KLHâs Accounting Department
debited the expense into, depending on the nature of the fapiao, items such as travel,
entertainment, or meals, and credited accounts receivable. KLHâs Accounting
Department knew that KLH sales personnel were submitting inaccurate fapiao, but were
comfortable with receiving any type of fapiao, as this allowed the Accounting
Department to make certain income statement deductions.

RAE Instructs KLH Personnel to Stop Bribery Practices

14. During a June 2004 board meeting, RAE instructed RAE-KLH personnel
that its business practices (i) shall-follow the norms of major multi-national companies
doing business in China by utilizing finderâs fees, commissions, consulting fees, etc.; and
(ii) this shall be properly communicated to the organization and put into practice as soon
as practical, but no later than October 1, 2004. RAE also communicated orally to RAE-
KLH officers that bribery practices must stop.

15. While RAE communicated these instructions to RAE-KLH personnel,
RAE did not impose sufficient internal controls or make any changes to the practice of
sales personnel obtaining cash advances. RAE did not, for example, change the fact that

inaccurate fapiao was often submitted to justify cash advances.

RAEâs CFO Visits RAE-KLH and Observes Evidence of Possible Continuing
Bribery

16. In May 2005, RAEâs then Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
visited RAEâs Chinese facilities, including RAE-KLH. RAEâs CFO observed that, from
late 2004 through May 2005, RAE-KLH had approximately $500,000 in cash advances
for which it had not yet received any fapiao.

17. Given this observation, RAEâs CFO, e-mailed a report sent to RAE
headquarters in the United States, writing, â[t]here is the possibility that cash may also be
used for grease payments, to supplement sales employeesâ incomes and as bribes . . .â
The CFO explained that the suggestion of some abuse is derived from, among other
things, the âaging balance of un-receipted advances... .â

RAE Implements FCPA Compliance Training at RAE-KLH *

18. Inresponse to the CFO report, in early June 2005, the Company
implemented FCPA compliance training and required each RAE-KLH employee to
certify that he or she did not engage in bribery practices. ~

19. Again, however, the Company did not impose sufficient internal controls
or make changes to the practice of sales personnel obtaining cash advances.

Bribery at RAE-KLH Continues Despite Compliance Training

20. Despite the. measures taken above, bribery persisted at RAE-KLH. In
particular, because the Company had not implemented any changes or controls to the
cash advance system, RAE-KLH sales personnel could, and often did, obtain cash
advances to bribe foreign officials in order to obtain or retain business.

21. In 2006, RAE-KLH booked additional sales revenue, as a result of gifts,
entertainment, and other payments provided to government officials, resulting in
$153,717 in total gross margin that would not otherwise have accrued to RAE during this
period.

22. As was the case prior to RAEâs acquisition of KLH, the expenses
associated with these cash advances were improperly recorded on the books of RAE-
KLH as âbusiness feesâ or âtravel and entertainmentâ (T&E) expenses. They appear to

have been classified for U.S. GAAP purposes as T&E expenses.
23. In January 2006, RAE-KLH entered into a consultancy agreement with a
Chinese third-party agent, purportedly for technical services rendered in connection with
a single government-affiliated oil project contract. RAE-KLH paid the third-party agent
RMB 688,000 (approximately $86,195) pursuant to this contract.

24. The third-party agent, however, did not use these funds for technical
services. Rather, the third-party agent, on RAE-KLHâs behalf, made improper payments
to one or more employees of a state-owned enterprise affiliated with the Dagang Oil
Field. As a result of these payments, RAE-KLH won an RMB 5,000,000 contract from
the Dagang Oil Field, which resulted in gross margin of $208,914 that would otherwise
have not accrued to the Company.

RAE Becomes Aware of Possible Continuing Bribery at RAE-KLH

25. In August 2006, the recently terminated General Manager at RAE-KLH
sent an e-mail message to RAE headquarters in the United States with a new allegation
concerning ongoing bribery practices occurring at RAE-KLH. In particular, the former
General Manager alleged that RAE-KLH had entered into an RMB 380,000.
(approximately $48,000) money laundering contract for the purpose of masking
kickbacks that had been paid to RAE-KLH clients.

26. In particular, the former General Manager emailed, â[w]e used this
contract to pay 380,000 RMB and then get back 355,000 RMB; the balance of the 25,000
RMB was used to purchase invoices at the value of 380,000 RMB.. . . these invoices
were purchased to offset the personal borrowings of more than 6 million RMB on the
account of the company. Those personal borrowings of more than 6 million RMB were
actually kickbacks paid to our clients.â The former General Manager added that, âthis
problem needed to be solved as soon as possible; otherwise, it would give the company
trouble for falsified increase of profits, commercial bribery, and the like.â

27. | The Company responded to the specific allegation concerning the alleged

money-laundering contract. The money provided by RAE-KLH under this contract was
returned to it. RAE, however, failed to perform an Internal Audit or other investigation
into the general allegation that bribery was continuing.

28. Moreover, notwithstanding these allegations, the Company again did not
impose any internal controls or make significant changes to the practice of sales

personnel obtaining cash advances.

RAE Acquires Fushun and Bribery Continues at RAE-KLH and RAE-
Fushun

29. In December 2006, RAE acquired its 70% interest in Fushun Anyi, and
became known as RAE-Fushun. Fushun Anyiâs clients, like RAE-KLHâs clients, were
largely state-owned enterprises or government departments.

30. Like RAE-KLH, RAE-Fushun sales personnel financed their sales
activities and sales-related travel throughout mainland China using cash advances and
reimbursements. The expenses associated with these cash advances were improperly
recorded on the books of RAE-Fushun as âbusiness feesâ or âtravel and entertainmentâ
(T&E) expenses. They appear to have been classified for U.S. GAAP purposes as TRE
expenses.

31. Tn 2007, bribery occurred at both RAE-KLH and RAE-Fushun. First,
during 2007, RAE-KLH sales personnel continued to use cash advances to bribe
government officials. In one such instance, RAE-KLH sales personnel purchased a
notebook computer for the Deputy Director of a state-owned chemical plant.

32. Second, in 2007, RAE-KLH entered into an RMB 2,000,000 contract with
the same third-party agent it used in connection with its contract relating to the Dagang
Oil Field. The third-party agent agreed to, among other things, (i) provide RAE-KLH
with market research and consultation services related to the business development of
RAE-KLH in mainland China and (ii) maintain and develop sound relationships with

authoritative government agencies in mainland China.
33. Some of the money paid for the third party agentâs alleged consulting
services was improperly used; directly or indirectly, to help RAE-KLH obtain or retain
business from customers, including large state-owned enterprises or government
departments.

34. Ultimately, the third-party agentâs efforts in 2007 resulted in RAE-KLH
obtaining two contracts with government clients. RAE-KLH booked approximately
$640,000 in gross margin that would not have otherwise accrued to RAE-KLH without
the third-party agentâs efforts. ,

35. RAE-Fushun personnel also engaged in continued bribery practices in
2007. For example, RAE-Fushun personnel provided a variety of luxury items to
government officials to obtain or retain business, such as jade, fur coats, kitchen
appliances, suits, and high-priced liquor.

36. During 2007 and a portion of 2008, RAE-Fushun, as a result of gifts,
entertainment, and other payments provided to government officials, booked additional
sales revenue resulting in $142,048 in total gross margin that would not otherwise have
accrued to RAE during this period.

r U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

 

SEC Charges RAE Systems for Illegal Payments Made
Through Joint Ventures to Win Chinese Government
Contracts

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-242

Washington, D.C., Dec. 10, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission

today charged San Jose-based RAE Systems Inc. with violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for making improper payments through two of its
Chinese joint venture entities to Chinese officials in order to obtain significant
government contracts for their gas and chemical detection products.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 21770
Â» SEC Complaint

 

The SEC alleges that the $400,000 in improper payments resulted in contracts
worth approximately $3 million in revenue and garnered more than $1.1
million in illicit profits.

RAE agreed to pay approximately $1.25 million to settle the SEC's charges. In
a related criminal case, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that
RAE agreed to pay an additional $1.7 million criminal fine.

""RAE Systems develops products to detect harmful emissions, yet it did not
have adequate measures in place to detect and root out internal wrongdoing,""
said Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit.
""Companies that fail to respond to red flags can be held liable for the acts of
their joint venture partners.""

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, the payments â which occurred from 2004 to 2008 â were made
primarily by the direct sales force utilized by RAE at the two joint venture
entities: RAE-KLH (Beijing) Co., Limited (RAE-KLH) and RAE Coal Mine Safety
Instruments (Fushun) Co., Ltd. (RAE-Fushun).

The SEC alleges that RAE-KLH and RAE-Fushun sales personnel typically made
the illicit payments by obtaining cash advances from accounting personnel,
and that RAE did not impose sufficient internal controls or make any
meaningful changes to sales personnel practices. Expenses associated with
these payments were improperly recorded on the books of RAE-KLH and RAE-
Fushun as ""business fees"" or ""travel and entertainment"" expenses. Moreover,
while the payments were made exclusively in China and by Chinese
employees of RAE-KLH and RAE-Fushun, RAE failed to act on red flags
indicating this activity, which allowed, at least in part, the misconduct to
continue at RAE-KLH.

The SEC's complaint charges RAE with violations of the anti-bribery, books
and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. Without admitting
or denying the allegations, RAE consented to the entry of a permanent
injunction against FCPA violations and agreed to pay $1,147,800 in
disgorgement and $109,212 in prejudgment interest. RAE also agreed to
comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program.
The settlement is subject to court approval.

Ricky Sachar and C. Joshua Felker conducted the SEC's investigation. The
Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice's
Criminal Division-Fraud Section.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

 

 

CASE NO.:
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.
ALCATEL-LUCENT, S.A.,
Defendant.
COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

Page 1 of 24

Ls From December 2001 through June 2006, Alcatel, S.A., now called Alcatel-

Lucent, S.A. (âAlcatelâ or the âcompanyâ), through its subsidiaries and agents, violated the

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] by paying more than $8

million in bribes to foreign government officials. Alcatel made these payments to influence acts

and decisions by these foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, with the

knowledge and approval of certain management level personnel of the relevant Alcatel

subsidiaries. Alcatel lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent or detect such improper

payments, and improperly recorded the payments in its books and records.

2. During this period, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to foreign

government officials in several countries to obtain or retain business:
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 2 of 24

Â¢ From December 2001 to October 2004, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid at least
$7 million in bribes to government officials of Costa Rica to obtain or retain three
contracts to provide telephone services in Costa Rica totaling approximately $303
million.

Â¢ From December 2002 to June 2006, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to
government officials of Honduras to obtain or retain five telecommunications contracts
totaling approximately $48 million.

e From October 2003 to May 2004, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to
government officials of Taiwan to obtain or retain a railway axle counting contract
valued at approximately $27 million.

e From October 2004 to February 2006, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to
government officials of Malaysia to obtain or retain a telecommunications contract
valued at approximately $85 million.

3. All of these payments were undocumented or improperly recorded as consulting
fees in the books of Alcatelâs subsidiaries, and then consolidated into Alcatelâs financial
statements. A lax corporate control environment aided Alcatelâs improper conduct. Alcatel
failed to detect or investigate numerous red flags suggesting that its business consultants were
likely making illicit payments and gifts to government officials in these countries at the direction
of certain Alcatel employees. The respective heads of several Alcatel subsidiaries and
geographical regions, some of whom reported directly to Alcatelâs executive committee,
authorized extremely high commission payments under circumstances in which they failed to

determine whether such payments were, in part, to be funneled to government officials in
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 3 of 24

violation of the FCPA. These high-level employees therefore knew, or were severely reckless in
not knowing, that Alcatel paid bribes to foreign government officials.

4. By making these payments, Alcatel violated the FCPA as incorporated into the
federal securities laws as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), and also violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act.

5. Unless restrained and enjoined, Alcatel is reasonably likely to continue to engage

in the acts and practices set forth in this complaint and in acts and practices of similar purport

and object.
Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and

27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].

7. Personal jurisdiction and venue are appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78aa].

8. Alcatel, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in
connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this
complaint.

Il. DEFENDANT

9. Alcatel-Lucent, S.A. (âAlcatelâ), formerly known as Alcatel, S.A., a French
corporation headquartered in Paris, France, is one of the worldâs largest providers of
telecommunications equipment and services, with more than 75,000 employees in 140 countries,
including the United States. Until November 30, 2006, Alcatelâs American Depository Receipts

(âADRsâ) were registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b) and
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 4 of 24

traded on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ). As such, during the time the relevant
conduct occurred, Alcatel was required to file reports with the Commission under Section 13 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m], and was an âissuerâ within the meaning of the FCPA [15
US.C. Â§ 78dd-1]. Alcatel conducted its commercial transactions through its subsidiaries,
including Alcatel CIT, S.A. and Alcatel SEL, AG. On November 30, 2006, an Alcatel subsidiary
merged with Lucent Technologies Inc. in the United States and Alcatel changed its name to
Alcatel-Lucent, S.A. After the merger, the companyâs shares were traded on the Paris Euronext
exchange and as ADRs on the NYSE.
IV. RELATED ENTITIES

10. Alcatel CIT, S.A., now known as Alcatel-Lucent France, S.A., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Alcatel in France, sold telephone technology and networks to telecommunications
providers owned by foreign governments, including the governments of Costa Rica, Honduras,
and Malaysia, and paid Alcatelâs business consultants in those countries. Alcatel CITâs financial
results were included in the consolidated financial statements that Alcatel filed with the
Commission. Alcatel CIT maintained a bank account at ABN Amro Bank in New York, NY,
which was used, in part, to pay business consultants located around the world.

11. Alcatel Standard A.G., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Switzerland that
in 2007 was merged into Alcatel-Lucent Trade International A.G., entered into most agreements
with business consultants worldwide on behalf of Alcatel CIT and other Alcatel entities,
including the agreements that are referenced in this complaint.

12. Alcatel de Costa Rica S.A., now known as Alcatel Centroamerica S.A., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Costa Rica, was responsible for the day-to-day

commercial operations of Alcatel in Costa Rica and Honduras. Throughout the relevant time
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 5 of 24

period, Alcatel de Costa Ricaâs financial results were included in the consolidated financial
statements that Alcatel filed with the Commission.

13. Alcatel SEL, A.G., now known as Alcatel-Lucent Deutschland A.G., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Germany, participated in bidding for railway projects in Taiwan.
Throughout the relevant time period, Alcatel SELâs financial results were included in the
consolidated financial statements that Alcatel filed with the Commission.

14. Alcatel Malaysia, a majority-owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Malaysia, was
responsible for the day-to-day commercial operations of Alcatel in Malaysia. Alcatel currently
owns 51% of its shares. Two private local entities own the remaining shares. Alcatel Malaysiaâs
financial results were consolidated in the financial statements Alcatel filed with the Commission.

V. FACTS

15. Alcatel, the parent issuer, was run by an executive committee made up of very
senior officers, including the CEO and CFO, and a handful of support staff. Alcatel itself did not
conduct actual business with any customer. Starting in the 1990s, Alcatel utilized a consistent
strategy to obtain contracts in many parts of the world, under which Alcatel typically used a
subsidiary in the country to obtain contracts. The subsidiaryâs âcountry senior officerâ managed
the subsidiary and selected business consultants purportedly to provide sales, marketing, and
technical support and, in some cases, to lobby government officials to obtain public contracts in
that country.

16. Alcatel used Alcatel Standard to conduct very limited due diligence on the
business consultants. The country senior officer then prepared a cursory description of the
services the business consultants would perform and the compensation they would receive.

Based on the limited information provided to them, the heads of Alcatel Standard, of the
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 6 of 24

subsidiary with the customer contract (Alcatel CIT for most of the agreements that are referenced
in this complaint), and of various geographical regions all approved the retention of the
consultants.

17. After having obtained all necessary approvals for the retention of the business
consultant, Alcatel Standard entered into an agreement with the consultant, usually requiring the
consultant to perform vaguely-described marketing services. The subsidiary with the customer
contract (Alcatel CIT for most of the agreements that are referenced in this complaint) typically
paid the consultants, usually after it had successfully obtained and executed contracts with the
government to sell telecommunications services and equipment. In every bribery scheme
described in this complaint, the respective heads of the relevant subsidiaries and geographic
regions either were aware of, or ignored, significant red flags that indicated that the respective
country senior officers and other Alcatel employees were using business consultants to pay
bribes to foreign government officials.

18. Alcatelâs internal controls over payments to its business consultants in foreign
countries were weak at best. Although at some point Alcatel utilized more than 235 business
consultants in more than 70 countries, the employees responsible for reviewing due diligence
reports on the companyâs business consultants sometimes did not speak the language in which
these reports were written, and had little or no understanding of these consultantsâ background or
the tasks they purportedly performed.

19. | While Alcatel had a company-wide FCPA training program, Alcatelâs employees
routinely disregarded or circumvented it. For example, a former high-level employee and the
president of Alcatel Standard trained country senior officers, including those who conducted

business in Latin America and Taiwan, on how to âpaperâ consulting agreements so that Alcatel
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 7 of 24

Standard would authorize them. The controls Alcatel had in place were insufficient to prevent
bribery because Alcatel employees either disregarded or circumvented them by providing
incomplete and inaccurate information to those involved in the review process. Finally, although
Alcatel had a risk assessment committee, it typically focused on issues that were likely to result
in customer lawsuits and not on bribery or excessive commissions to business consultants.

A. The Costa Rica Bribery Scheme

20. From December 2001 to October 2004, Alcatel bribed government officials in
Costa Rica to obtain telecommunications contracts valued at approximately $303 million.

21. The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (the âICEâ) is the Costa Rican
government-owned company that provides telecommunications services, evaluates bids, and
awards telecommunications contracts in Costa Rica. The ICE was governed by a seven-member
board of directors that evaluated and approved, on behalf of the government of Costa Rica, all
bid proposals submitted by telecommunications companies. The Board of Directors was led by
an Executive President, who was appointed by the President of Costa Rica. The other members
of the Board of Directors were appointed by the President of Costa Rica and the Costa Rican
governing cabinet.

22. Prior to 2001, Alcatel CIT was not able to secure mobile telecommunications
contracts from the ICE. Among other things, the ICE was using a different technology from the
GSM technology Alcatel CIT was offering. In late 2000, Edgar Valverde, at the time the
President and Country Senior Officer of Alcatel de Costa Rica, and Christian Sapsizian, Alcatel
CITâs Director for Latin America from February 1996 until October 2004, enlisted two Costa
Rican consulting companies with many contacts at the ICE (âCosta Rican Consultant Aâ and

âCosta Rican Consultant Bâ) to assist Alcatel in obtaining mobile telecommunications contracts.
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 8 of 24

Valverde and Sapsizian hired the consultants in part to bribe officials in the government of Costa
Rica in exchange for telecommunications contracts.

23.  Valverdeâs brother-in-law owned and controlled Costa Rican Consultant A.
However, Valverde intentionally omitted this fact from the company profile he prepared and
submitted to Alcatel Standard. Alcatel Standard failed to conduct adequate due diligence on
Costa Rican Consultant A and, therefore, never identified its registered shareholders and ultimate
beneficial owner.

24. In November 2000, prior to a formal vote by the ICE Board of Directors,
Sapsizian and Valverde offered a bribe to an ICE director (âICE Director Aâ) to be paid through
Costa Rican Consultant A. Specifically, they offered him 1.5% to 2% of the value of a contract
to develop a GSM mobile network in Costa Rica and provide 400,000 lines of mobile telephone
service (the â400K GSM Contractâ). The bribe was in exchange for his assistance in opening a
bid round for a GSM-based mobile network and to assist Alcatel CIT in obtaining contracts from
the ICE. With ICE Director Aâs hired influence, the ICE Board formally voted to open a bid
round for developing a mobile network in Costa Rica using the GSM technology.

25. On June 12, 2001, in part because of ICE Director Aâs assistance, the ICE
awarded Alcatel CIT a contract, valued at approximately $44 million, to supply equipment for
the ICE fixed network. On August 28, 2001, in part because of ICE Director Aâs assistance, the
ICE awarded Alcatel CIT a second contract, the 400K GSM Contract, which gave Alcatel CIT
100% of all new mobile lines installed in Costa Rica and 50% of all existing mobile lines. The
contract was valued at approximately $149.5 million. In May 2002, in part because of ICE
Director Aâs assistance, the ICE awarded Alcatel CIT a third contract, for the expansion of the

fixed telephone lines central stations, valued at approximately $109.4 million.
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 9 of 24

26. From March 2001 to March 2003, Alcatel Standard, on behalf of Alcatel CIT,
executed at least five consulting agreements with Costa Rican Consultant A, in which Alcatel
CIT promised to pay up to 9.75% of the value of any contract it assisted Alcatel CIT in obtaining
with the ICE - a much higher commission rate than normally awarded to such a consultant. In
return, the consulting agreements required Costa Rican Consultant A to perform vaguely-
described marketing and advisory services. Costa Rican Consultant A created invoices
purportedly for commissions related to the contracts awarded to Alcatel CIT. It then submitted
those invoices, through Valverde, to Alcatel CIT.

27. Starting in December 2001, after the ICE awarded Alcatel its first two contracts,
and continuing until October 2003, Alcatel CIT transferred from its account at ABN Amro Bank
in New York approximately $14.5 million to an account at the International Bank of Miami in
Miami, Florida, to be further credited to Costa Rican Consultant Aâs account at Cuscatlan
Intemational Bank in Costa Rica. This $14.5 million fee bore no relation to actual services Costa
Rican Consultant A provided. In reality, it was to be used largely to pay bribes to government
officials. Costa Rican Consultant A used at least $7 million of that money to pay officials of the
government of Costa Rica for assisting Alcatel CIT in obtaining and retaining business in Costa

Rica, including:

 

Position Approximate Amount of Bribe

 

ICE Director A $2.56 million in addition to certificates of
deposit totaling $100,000

 

High-ranking executive branch official $950,000 received through ICE Director A

 

 

 

 

 

 

ICE CEO $945,000
ICE Administrator $145,000
ICE Administrator $110,000

 
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 10 of 24

 

Presidential Candidate $100,000

 

ICE Director B $1.3 million

 

Party leader in Congress for the Social
Christian Unity Party $550,000

 

 

 

 

28. Similarly, from March 2001 to December 2002, Alcatel Standard, on behalf of
Alcatel CIT, executed at least four consulting agreements with Costa Rican Consultant B to
assist Alcatel in obtaining telecommunications contracts in Costa Rica. The agreements required
Costa Rican Consultant B to perform vaguely-described advisory services. Costa Rican
Consultant B then created phony invoices, purportedly for commissions related to the contracts
awarded to Alcatel, and submitted those invoices to Alcatel CIT. As with Costa Rican
Consultant A, Alcatel authorized Costa Rican Consultant B to receive a much higher commission
rate on certain projects than normally awarded to such a consultant.

29. Alcatel CIT transferred from its account at ABN Amro Bank in New York
approximately $3.9 million to Costa Rican Consultant B. This fee also bore no relation to actual
services Costa Rican Consultant B provided and was also to be used to pay bribes to government
officials. Costa Rican Consultant B paid officials of the government of Costa Rica, including at
least $930,000 to ICE director C from December 2002 until June 2004.

30. The President of Area 1, which encompassed Latin America, worked in Alcatelâs
Miami office between 2000 and 2003 (and directly reported to a member of Alcatelâs executive
committee). This individual approved the payments to the Costa Rican consultants, despite their
high amounts. On several occasions, this individual stated that he could go to jail if authorities

in France or the United States uncovered where these payments were actually going.

10
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 11 of 24

31. The president of Alcatel Standard, who also held the title of Director of
International Affairs and reported to Alcatelâs controller, also approved the retention of and
payment to these consultants despite numerous red flags that should have alerted him that these
payments were unlawful, such as the large size of the commissions and the fact that Alcatel CIT
already had two other consultants in such a small country as Costa Rica.

32. Some of the key Alcatel employees who were responsible for reviewing progress
reports on the companyâs consultants in Costa Rica did not speak Spanish and, therefore, could
not understand the reports that contained information about the work these consultants
purportedly performed. As a result, they relied on Sapsizian to translate documents and assure
them that the consultants in question were doing the work they were engaged to do.

33. Sapsizian also approved the payment of approximately $25,000 in expenses
incurred by ICE officials during a trip to Paris in October 2003 while Alcatel CIT was attempting
to obtain an extension of a fixed network contract in Costa Rica. He instructed an Alcatel CIT
employee to pay for some of these expenses in cash to conceal the payments and avoid leaving a
paper trail leading to Alcatel. All of these payments were intended to reward these government
officials for providing Alcatel CIT with lucrative contracts.

34. All of these officials were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA and
were in a significant position to influence the policy decisions the ICE made.

B. The Honduras Bribery Scheme

35. From December 2002 to June 2006, Alcatel bribed government officials in
Honduras to obtain or retain at least five telecommunications contracts valued at approximately

$48 million.

11
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 12 of 24

36. In February 2002, in Key Biscayne, Florida, Sapsizian and another Alcatel CIT
employee met with the brother of a high-ranking executive branch official in the government of
Honduras to discuss how the brothers and Alcatel could assist each other. Sapsizian participated
in this meeting to make sure the brothers understood that Alcatelâs upper management in France
supported any promise made to them. The executive branch officialâs brother requested that
Alcatel retain a specific consulting company in Honduras (âHonduran Consultantâ).

37. Later in 2002, Alcatel CIT informally retained the Honduran Consultant and
promised to pay it commissions of 3% to 5% of the value of certain contracts Alcatel CIT
secured in Honduras. The Honduran Consultant represented perfume and cosmetics companies
in Honduras and operated as an exclusive distributor of brand name fragrances. The Honduran
Consultant had no contacts in, or prior experience with, the telecommunications industry in
Honduras. The executive branch officialâs brother controlled the Honduran Consultant and
Alcatel CITâs sole purpose for retaining this consultant was to gain access to the high-ranking
executive branch official and influence the decisions of the Empresa Hondurefia de
Telecomunicaciones (âHondutelââ), the Honduran government-owned telecommunications
provider responsible for awarding and administering public tenders for telecommunications
contracts in Honduras.

38. As a result of Alcatelâs agreement to retain and pay the Honduran Consultant,
there was significant pressure on Hondutel, and on the senior government officials sitting on its
Board of Directors, to keep Alcatel CIT and another Alcatel subsidiary as the contractors on five
contracts which were awarded from 2002 through 2003, worth a total of about $48 million, in
spite of significant failures in performance that could have resulted in termination under the

terms of the agreement. These contracts included a $2.36 million contract signed on November

12
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 13 of 24

12, 2002; a $17.92 million contract signed on May 12, 2003; a $7.91 million contract signed on
October 27, 2003; a $2.49 million contract signed on December 6, 2003, and a $17.39 million
contract signed on December 12, 2003. At least one of these contracts was never presented to
the public and was awarded directly to Alcatel.

39. Alcatel Standard did not memorialize its agreement with the Honduran Consultant
until October 2003, after Hondutel had already awarded two contracts to Alcatel CIT, at which
time it formally retained the Honduran Consultant to perform vaguely-described marketing and
advisory services. At that time, Alcatel Standard memorialized its agreement to pay the
Honduran Consultant commissions of 3% to 5% of the value of certain contracts Alcatel CIT and
another Alcatel subsidiary secured in Honduras.

40. Alcatel Standard knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the Honduran
Consultant was a conduit to pay bribes. Alcatel Standard failed to conduct adequate due
diligence about the Honduran Consultant and did not uncover its relationship with the high-
ranking executive branch official, despite a number of red flags. First, the Honduran Consultant
was a perfume distributor with no experience in telecommunications. Second, the executive
branch officialâs brother regularly communicated with Alcatel employees via an e-mail address
from a domain name affiliated with the executive branch official and his family. Third, at some
point in late 2003, the executive branch official and his brother directly contacted the President
of Area 1 in an effort to collect sales commissions Alcatel purportedly owed to the Honduran
Consultant. Finally, the President of Area 1 was aware of the relationship between the Honduran
Consultant and the executive branch officialâs brother, and personally met with the executive

branch official to discuss Alcatelâs expansion in Honduras.

13
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 14 of 24

41. Following efforts by the high-ranking executive branch official and his brother to
pressure Alcatel to pay the Honduran Consultant, Alcatel paid $704,388 to the Honduran
Consultant between September 2004 and June 2006. The President of Area 1 allowed these
payments despite knowing that the Honduran Consultant was a perfume distributor controlled by
the brother of the executive branch official. Although the press widely covered the bribery
scheme in Costa Rica beginning in October 2004, and Alcatelâs executive committee knew at
that time that Sapsizian and Valverde paid bribes at the highest level of the Costa Rican
government using sham consultants, Alcatel took no steps to terminate the Honduran Consultant
and Alcatel CIT continued to make these illicit payments until June 2006. Although it is
unknown whether the Honduran Consultant shared this money with the executive branch official,
Sapsizian had every expectation that money Alcatel paid to the Honduran Consultant would flow
to the executive branch official.

42. Alcatel CIT also paid for Hondutelâs general manager and his wife to travel to
Europe in June 2003 and for his daughter to travel to Europe in 2004, without any legitimate
business purposes. Alcatel CIT also paid for the president of Conatel, the Honduran government
agency that regulated the telecommunications sector in Honduras, who had close ties to the
executive branch official, to travel to various conferences, including in Paris, France in July 2003
and in Cannes, France in December 2004. Finally, Alcatel CIT paid for a Hondutel attorney and
her daughter to travel to Paris in June 2003, a trip which consisted almost entirely of leisure
activities and featured a private driver. In March 2004, Alcatel CIT also paid $1,500 to this
Hondutel attorney.

43. All of these officials were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA and

were in a significant position to influence the policy decisions Hondutel made.

Cc. The Taiwan Bribery Scheme

44. From October 2003 to May 2004, Alcatel bribed government officials in Taiwan
to obtain a railway axle counting contract valued at approximately $27 million.

45. A senior Alcatel employee, at the time Director of International Business and
Sales at Alcatel SEL AG, an Alcatel subsidiary, (âAlcatel SEL employeeâ) hired two consultants
in Taiwan (âTaiwanese Consultant Aâ and âTaiwanese Consultant Bâ) in 2000 and 2002,
respectively. Both consultants possessed close ties to legislators in the Taiwanese government.

46. The Alcatel SEL employee hired Taiwanese Consultant A in 2000 to pressure the
Taiwan Railway Administration (the âTRAâ) to act in Alcatelâs favor in the bid process. The
TRA, a Taiwanese government-owned authority, was responsible for awarding and
administering public tenders for contracts to manufacture and install axle counting systems to
facilitate rail traffic in Taiwan. The TRA was an agency of Taiwanâs Ministry of Transportation
and Communications, a cabinet-level governmental body responsible for the regulation of
transportation and communications networks and operations.

47. As with most consultants hired by Alcatel, Taiwanese Consultant A entered into a
consulting agreement with Alcatel Standard. In the course of its due diligence, Alcatel Standard
repeatedly requested more information concerning Taiwanese Consultant A from Alcatel SEL.
Although Alcatel SEL only provided limited information about Taiwanese Consultant A, Alcatel
Standard circumvented its own procedures and approved the consulting agreement.
Additionally, the Alcatel SEL employee subsequently amended this agreement to increase
Taiwanese Consultant Aâs compensation, without following Alcatelâs procedure for the

amendment of consulting agreements.

15
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 16 of 24

48. In May 2004, Alcatel SEL paid a commission of approximately $920,000 to
Taiwanese Consultant A through its account at ABN Amro Bank in New York. At various
times, Taiwanese Consultant A paid bribes to two Taiwanese legislators, Legislator A and
Legislator B.

49. Legislator A assisted Alcatel in convincing the TRA that Alcatel SELâs system
satisfied the technical requirements of the tenders. He also publicly supported Alcatel SELâs bid
and provided advice to Alcatel SEL concerning its TRA documents. Legislator B, in turn, was
requested to alter the TRAâs technical specifications to improve Alcatel SELâs bidding chances.
Although it is unclear how much of Alcatel SELâs $920,000 eventually flowed to foreign
government officials, the owner of Taiwanese Consultant A promised $180,000 in campaign
funds for Legislator Bâs 2004 election and paid him at least $90,000 in 2004, after Alcatel SELâs
affiliate won the bid.

50. The Alcatel SEL employee and Taiwanese Consultant A also spent approximately
$10,000 to arrange trips to Germany in October 2003 for the secretary to the Taiwan
Transportation and Communications Minister, and in 2002 for an assistant in the office of
Legislator A. Both trips were for personal, entertainment purposes, and the secretary to the
Taiwan Transportation and Communications Minister invited his ex-wife at Alcatelâs expense.
Alcatel SEL paid for the hotel directly and reimbursed the Alcatel SEL employee for travel
expenses, including train tickets, taxis, lavish meals, and small gifts. Alcatel SELâs management
in Germany knew of and approved reimbursement of many of these expenses.

51. | Without Alcatel Standardâs approval, the Alcatel SEL employee hired Taiwanese
Consultant B in 2002, because its owner was the brother of another Taiwanese legislator,

Legislator C. To bribe Legislator C, the Alcatel SEL employee and others created a phony

16
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 17 of 24

consulting agreement between an Alcatel affiliate and Taiwanese Consultant B, even though
Taiwanese Consultant B was never expected to provide any services to Alcatel or its affiliate.
An Alcatel affiliate paid approximately $36,000 to Taiwanese Consultant B in 2004.

52. Legislators A, B, and C were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA
and were in a significant position to influence the policy decisions the TRA made.

53. The fees Alcatel SEL and Alcatelâs affiliate paid to Taiwanese Consultant A and
Taiwanese Consultant B, respectively, bore no relation to actual services these entities provided
to Alcatel.

54. On December 30, 2003, the TRA accepted an Alcatel affiliateâs price bid and
granted the affiliate a supply contract worth approximately $27 million.

D. The Malaysia Bribery Scheme

55. From October 2004 to February 2006, Alcatel bribed government officials in
Malaysia to obtain confidential information relating to a public tender that Alcatel ultimately
won, the result of which yielded a telecommunications contract valued at approximately $85
million.

56. Telekom Malaysia is the Malaysian government-owned telecommunications
company that provides telecommunications services, evaluates bids, and awards
telecommunications contracts in Malaysia. The Malaysian Ministry of Finance owned
approximately 43% of Telekom Malaysiaâs shares, had veto power over all its major
expenditures, and made its key operational decisions. The government owned its interest in
Telekom Malaysia through the Minister of Finance, who had the status of a âspecial

shareholder.â Most senior Telekom Malaysia officers were political appointees, including the

17
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 18 of 24

Chairman and Director, the Chairman of the Board of the Tender Committee, and the Executive
Director.

57. Between October 2004 and February 2006, Alcatel Malaysia personnel paid
bribes to employees of Telekom Malaysia in exchange for non-public information. This non-
public information included important documents and budget information relating to ongoing
bids and competitor pricing information. Alcatel Malaysiaâs management consented to these
payments.

58. These bribes assisted Alcatel Malaysia in obtaining a contract with a potential
value of $85 million.

59. | The Telekom Malaysia employees who received bribes were âforeign officialsâ
within the meaning of the FCPA and were in a significant position to influence the policy
decisions Telekom Malaysia made.

60. Alcatel Standard also made significant lump-sum payments through U.S. bank
accounts to two consultants (âMalaysian Consultant Aâ and âMalaysian Consultant Bâ),
purportedly for market research.

61. Alcatel Standard paid $200,000 to Malaysian Consultant A in 2005 for a series of
âmarket reportsâ describing conditions in the Malaysian telecommunications market. Similarly,
Alcatel Standard paid $500,000 to Malaysian Consultant B in 2005 for a âstrategic intelligence
report.â

62. However, the work product these consultants prepared could not justify the size of
Alcatel Standardâs payments. In fact, Malaysian Consultant A and Malaysian Consultant B did

not appear to render any legitimate services to Alcatel Malaysia in connection with these

payments.

18
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 19 of 24

63. These consultants also worked for Alcatel Malaysia before formal agreements
were finalized and executed, under what they called âgentlemenâs agreements,â which required
that consulting agreements be entered into retroactively. This process allowed consultants to
work for Alcatel Malaysia without being properly vetted through Alcatel Standardâs due
diligence process.

E. Alcatel Employed U.S. Means to Engage in Bribery

64. Alcatel made bribe payments directly or indirectly to foreign government officials
in connection with numerous projects involving business in Costa Rica, Honduras, Taiwan, and
Malaysia, including using the mails and other means and instrumentalities of United States
interstate commerce. The use of interstate commerce in connection with bribery included
making illegal payments through United States banks; conducting meetings in the United States
in furtherance of a bribery scheme; signing or approving sham consulting agreements in the
United States to conceal the bribery scheme; and transmitting mail, electronic mail, and facsimile
messages in and out of the United States.

F. Alcatel Failed to Maintain Its Books and Records

65. Alcatel made numerous payments to third parties in ways that obscured the
purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the payments. In particular, Alcatel CIT and Alcatel
SEL together paid more than $8 million in bribes to foreign government officials. Doing so
involved the falsification of Alcatelâs books and records by employees throughout the company
(including at Alcatel CIT, Alcatel Standard, Alcatel SEL, and Alcatel Malaysia). Specifically,
Alcatel failed to keep accurate books and records by (1) entering into consulting agreements
retroactively; (2) establishing and using a system of intermediaries to obscure the source and

destination of funds; (3) making payments pursuant to business consulting agreements that

19
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 20 of 24

inaccurately described the services provided; (4) generating false invoices and other false
documents to justify payments; (5) disbursing funds in cash with inaccurate documentation
authorizing or supporting the withdrawals; (6) recording illicit payments as legitimate consulting
fees; and (7) recording bribes as payment for legitimate services.

G. Alcatel Failed to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

66. Alcatel failed to implement adequate internal controls to comply with the
companyâs NYSE listing, including the detection and prevention of violations of the FCPA.
First, Alcatel and/or its subsidiaries falsified books and records, entered into agreements
retroactively, and obscured the purpose for, and ultimate recipient of, illicit payments. Alcatel
used business consultants and intermediaries to funnel bribes in at least four countries. Alcatel
created and used false invoices and payment documentation under business consulting
agreements that described services that were never intended to be rendered. Illicit payments
were falsely recorded as expenses for consulting fees.

67. Second, Alcatel also routinely circumvented the internal controls the company
had in place. Although the company in theory had a policy of âchecks and balancesâ to
authorize the retention of business consultants, which required several signatures to approve the
retention of, and payment to, business consultants, Alcatel employees often violated that policy.
In numerous instances, Alcatel officials responsible for reviewing due diligence reports on
consultants failed to conduct any review of the documents or could not read the language in
which the documents were written. Alcatel employees also entered into agreements retroactively
and obscured the amounts paid to business consultants by splitting the payments among separate
agreements (to conceal the high commissions Alcatel paid). Finally, Alcatel Standardâs due

diligence on business consultants was inadequate, and Alcatel CIT often paid business

20
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 21 of 24

consultants without adequate proof of services rendered. Alcatel CIT failed to establish robust
controls over cash disbursements, allowed manual payments without documentation, and
Alcatelâs FCPA compliance function was understaffed and lacked: independence. Alcatel also
failed to conduct thorough anti-bribery and corruption training.

SEC Charges Alcatel-Lucent with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-258

Company to Pay More Than $137 Million to Settle SEC and DOJ
Charges

Washington, D.C., Dec. 27, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged Paris-based telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent, S.A.
with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying bribes to

foreign government officials to illicitly win business in Latin America and Asia.

 

Additional Materials

Â» Litigation Release No. 21795

Â» SEC Complaint
Â» French Translation

Â® Spanish Translation

 

The SEC alleges that Alcatelâs subsidiaries used consultants who performed
little or no legitimate work to funnel more than $8 million in bribes to
government officials in order to obtain or retain lucrative telecommunications
contracts and other contracts. Alcatel agreed to pay more than $45 million to
settle the SECâs charges, and pay an additional $92 million to settle criminal
charges announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âAlcatel and its subsidiaries failed to detect or investigate numerous red flags
suggesting their employees were directing sham consultants to provide gifts
and payments to foreign government officials to illegally win business,â said
Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âAlcatelâs
bribery scheme was the product of a lax corporate control environment at the
company.â

Glenn S. Gordon, Associate Director for Enforcement in the SECâs Miami
Regional Office, added, âThe serious sanctions Alcatel has agreed to,
including paying back all net profits made on the contracts Alcatel illegally
obtained, should serve as a reminder that we are committed to enforcing the
FCPA and a level playing field for companies seeking to obtain or retain
business in other countries.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in the Southern District of Florida,
Alcatelâs bribes went to government officials in Costa Rica, Honduras,
Malaysia, and Taiwan between December 2001 and June 2006. An Alcatel
subsidiary provided at least $14.5 million to consulting firms through sham
consulting agreements for use in the bribery scheme in Costa Rica. Various
high-level government officials in Costa Rica received at least $7 million of
the $14.5 million to ensure Alcatel obtained or retained three contracts to
provide telephone services in Costa Rica.

The SEC alleges that the same Alcatel subsidiary bribed officials in the
government of Honduras to obtain or retain five telecommunications
contracts. Another Alcatel subsidiary made bribery payments to Malaysian
government officials in order to procure a telecommunications contract. An
Alcatel subsidiary also made illegal payments to various officials in the
government of Taiwan to win a contract to supply railway axle counters to the
Taiwan Railway Administration.

According to the SECâs complaint, all of the bribery payments were
undocumented or improperly recorded as consulting fees in the books of
Alcatelâs subsidiaries and then consolidated into Alcatelâs financial
statements. The leaders of several Alcatel subsidiaries and geographical
regions, including some who reported directly to Alcatelâs executive
committee, either knew or were severely reckless in not knowing about the
misconduct.

The SECâs complaint charges that Alcatel violated Section 30A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making illicit payments to foreign
government officials, through its subsidiaries and agents, in order to obtain or
retain business. Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by
failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the
payments. Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by
improperly recording the payments in its books and records. Alcatel violated
Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act when its subsidiaries knowingly failed to
implement a system of internal controls and knowingly falsified their books
and records to camouflage bribes as consulting payments. Without admitting
or denying the SECâs allegations, Alcatel has consented to a court order
permanently enjoining it from future violations of these statutory provisions;
ordering the company to pay $45.372 million in disgorgement of wrongfully
obtained profits, and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings including
an independent monitor for a three-year term. The settlement is subject to
court approval.

The SECâs case was investigated by Ernesto Palacios and Thierry Olivier
Desmet of the Division of Enforcementâs FCPA Unit and by Teresa J. Verges
and Fernando Torres - all of the Miami Regional Office.

The SEC acknowledges and appreciates assistance from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Office of the
Attorney General in Costa Rica, the Fiscalia de Delitos EconÃ©micos, CorrupciÃ©n
y Tributarios in Costa Rica; and the Service Central de PrÃ©vention de la
Corruption in France.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY |

â1. Innospec Inc. (âInnospecââ) is a manufacturer and distributor of fuel
additives and other specialty chemicals. From 2000 to 2007, Innospec violated the anti-
bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (âFCPAâ) when it routinely paid bribes in order to sell Tetra Ethyl Lead
(âTELâ), a fuel additive, which boosts the octane value of gasoline, to government owned
refineries and oil companies in Iraq and Indonesia. TEL is a sunset product because
worldwide use of TEL has declined since 1973 following the enactment of the Clean Air

Act of 1970 and similar legislation in other countries. Innospec engaged in bribery to

ry M.
maintain its TEL business, which accounted for significant revenue during the relevant
time period.

2. Innospec paid kickbacks to Iraq from 2001 to 2003 in order to obtain
contracts under the United Nations (âUNâ) Oil for Food Program (the âProgramâ). After
the Program ended in early 2003, Innospec paid bribes to Iraqi government officials until
late 2007 in order to secure additional contracts. Innospecâs bribery of government
officials in Indonesia began as early as 2000, and continued until 2005 , when Indonesiaâs -
need for TEL ended. Innospecâs former management did nothing to stop the bribery
activity, and in fact authorized and encouraged it. In addition, Innospecâs internal
controls failed to detect the illicit conduct, which continued for nearly a decade.

3. In all, Innospec made illicit payments of approximately $6,347,588 and
promised an additional $2,870,377 in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries, Iraqi
government officials, and Indonesian government officials in exchange for contracts
worth approximately $176,71 7,341 in revenues and profits of $60,071,613.

4. Innospec violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act by engaging in
widespread bribery of government officials in lrag during the post-Oil for Food period
and government officials in Indonesia in order to sell TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oi!
(âMoOâ) and state owned oil companies in Indonesia. Innospec violated Section
13(>)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to maintain internal controls to detect and
prevent bribery of officials in [raq and Indonesia as well as the illicit Oil for Food
Program kickbacks. Finally, Innospec violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act

by improperly recording all of the illicit payments to Iraq and Indonesia in its accounting

- FACTS
OL Background on The United Nations Oi for Food Program

23. The Oi for Food Program was mitended to provide humanitarian relief for
the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under the international trade sanctions
that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Program permitted the Iraqi
government to sell its crude oil and use the proceeds to purchase food, medicine, and
critical infrastructure supplies. |

24. The proceeds of the oil sales were transferred directly from the buyers to
an escrow account (the âU.N. Escrow Accountâ) maintained in New York by the United
Nations 661 Committee. Funds in the U.N. Escrow Account were available for the
purchase of humanitarian supplies, subject to U.N. approval and supervision... The intent
of this structure was to prevent the proceeds of iraqâs crude oil sales from undermining
the sanctions regime by supplying cash to Saddam Hussein.

25. Corruption was rampant within the Program. By mid-2000 Iraqi
ministries, on the instruction of top government officials, instituted a policy requiring
suppliers of humanitarian poods to pay a ten percent kickback on each contract. This
kickback requirement was euphemistically referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee
(âASSPâ), however, no services were provided. Suppliers competing to obtain contractsâ
under the Program were encouraged to include a ten percent markup in their bids or
purchase orders.

26. The inflated contract prices were incorporated into the Oi! for Food
contracts as a way to permit the suppliers to recover from the U.N. Escrow Account the

kickback payments they had paid secretly to Iraq. Following the 2004 release of a report
by the U.S. General Accounting Office exposing some of the abuses, the ULN..
comunissioned an independent inquiry committee, headed by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker (the âVolcker Committeeâ), to investigate the Programâs
performance. That committeeâs October 27, 2005, final report estimated that the Traqi
government had diverted $1.7 billion in iliicit income from the Program.

EL Tanospecâs Payment of After Sales Service Fees in Connection with the U.N.
OU For Food Program

27. From 2000 through 2003, Innospec participated in the U.N. Oil for Food
Program through its Swiss subsidiary, Alcor. During that period Alcor entered into five
contracts for the sale of TEL to the iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries
(âMoOâ) and paid kickbacks equating 10% of the contract value on three of the contracts.
In all, Innospec paid kickbacks of $1,853,754 and offered additional kickbacks of
$1,985,897 to Iraq, eaming revenues of approximately $45,804,915 on the five Oil for
Food contracts and profits of $23,125,820. |

28. Alcor executed five contracts with Iraqâs MoO and paid kickbacks to three
MoO refineries, Basrah, Daura and Baiji. Alcor used Iraqi Agent to funnel the payments

. to Iraq. On December 14, 2001, Alcor increased lraqi Agentâs standard commission on
three of the program contracts from 2% to 14% to enable him to pay the kickbacks.

29, For each of the three contracts, Alcor artificially inflated its prices in its
bids provided to. the UN by the 10% after sales service fee (âAS SEâ), Alcor did not
notify the UN of the secretly inflated prices or of Alcorâs intent to kickback 10% to Irag.
In order to meet Iraqâs dernand that the kickback be paid prior to the shipment of TEL,
Alcor forwarded the ASSF amount to Iraqi Agentâs bank account in Switzerland thirty

days in advance of shipment.
30. Ina fax to Innospec, Innospecâs agent stated that the contract price
included a â2% + 2%â fee for his company, plus an additional 10% for âThird Party
Reimbursement.â On June 2, 2001, Alcor Manager signed a side agreement on behalf of
Alcor promising to pay Iraq the 10% kickback referred to in iraqi Agentâs fax.
Thereafter Alcor wired the 10% ASSF, plus additional agentâs fees, to Iraqi Agentâs
Swiss account. Innospec entered into additional side agreements with Iraq to pay the
ASSFs.

31. â On the last two Oil for Food contracts, Alcor inflated its bid by 10% to
include an. ASSF. However, due to the subsequent invasion of Iraq by U.S. allied forces,
the kickbacks on the final two contracts were never collected by Iraqi officials and Alcor
incorporated the additional 10% into its profits. The kickback payments on the contracts
were improperly booked as legitimate commission payments.

1. Innospeeâs Post-Oil For Food Bribery Payments in lrag

32. After the Oil for Food Program was terminated in late 2003, Innospec
continued to use Iraqi Agent to pay bribes to Iraqi officials in order to secure TEL
business from Iraq.

33. From at least 2004 throngh 2007, Innospec made payments totaling
approximately $1 61 0,327 and promised an additional $884,480 to MoO officials $0 as to
garner good will with Iraqi authorities, obtain additional orders under a Long Term
Purchase Agreement that was executed in October 2004 (the â2004 LTPAâ) and ensure
the execution of a second LTPA in January 2008 (the â2008 LTPAâ). The total profit

received from the conduct was $15,439,183.
A Innospec Bribed Iraqi Government Officials im Connection with the
2004 LTPA

34, After the Oil for Food Program ended, Alcor entered into a three year
Long Term Purchase Agreement for the sale of TEL to the Iraqi MoO. The 2004 LTPA
was executed in October 2004, and was performed pursuant to six purchase orders dated
February 2005 through December 2007.

35. Under the contract, Alcor sold a total of 5 932 Metric Tons CMTâ) of
TEL at a price of â¬10,500 per MT. Innospecâs revenues from the contract were
$82,340,489, and profits were $15,198,125. |

36. With the approval of management, including Business Director and
Executive B, Iragi Agent continued to make improper payments to Iraqi officials to
facilitate TEL shipments under the 2004 LTPA. In an e-mail dated October 10, 2005,
Iraqi Agent informed Business Director and Executive B that prior to opening a letter of
credit for a 740 MT shipment of TEL, Iraqi officials were demanding a 2% kickback
from Alcor, which equaled $195,912.78. lraqi Agentâs e-mail further stated that: âWe
are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and
we will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to
get the rewards.â |

37. Business Director responded to Iraqi Agentâs e-mail on October 13, 2005,
confirming that the requested kickback would be paid through an additional 2%
âcommissionâ to fraqi Agent. On October 20, 2005, Business Director and Alcor
Manager discussed the wording of the invoice that Iraqi Agent would submit to Alcor to
support the kickback, with Business Director stating that âthe fewer words the better!â

That same day, Business Director e-mailed Iraqi Agent the fictitious language that he
wanted the agent to include in the invoice submitted to Alcor for the $195,912.78
payment.

38. In a similar e-mail dated February 5, 2006, Iraqi Agent informed Business |
Director that Iraqi officials were again demanding a 2% kickback in order to open a letter
of credit for an order of 2000 MT Cater revised to 2200 MT) of TEL under the 2004
LTPA. |

39. Inan e-mail dated February 7, 2006, Executive B approved the kickback
payment, and on February 10, 2006, Business Director wrote fragi Agent to confirm that
Alcor would pay him an additional 2% âcommissionâ in connection with the order. In
. July 2006, Alcor officially increased Iraqi Agentâs commission on the 2004 LTPA from
3% to 5% with the understanding that the additional 2% would be used to pay off Iraqi
officials on future LTPA orders.

40. In all, from October 2005 to 2007, Innospec paid approximately
$1,369,269 in bribes to Iraqi officials in connection with the 2004 LIPA. The payments
were improperly booked as legitimate commission payments.

B. Innospec Bribed Iraqi Government Officials to Ensure the Failure of

a 2006 Trial Test of MIVET and to Facilitate the Execution of a Second
LTPA with rag in 2008

41. In addition to the bribes to facilitate TEL orders on the 2004 LTPA,
Innospec paid Iraqi Agent a total of $155,000 in September 2006 and April 2007, so that
he could ensure the failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured
by a competitor of Innospec and that competed with TEL.

42. Innospec was concemed that ifthe MMT test was successful it would

cause Iraq to purchase substantial amounts of MMT for its oil refineries and lead to a

id
corresponding decrease in demand for TEL in 2008. Accordingly, on September 18,
2006, Business Director approved a payment of $105,000 to Iraqi Agent, purportedly âfor -
additional technical support and security operations required to nurture and protect
ongoing TEL business in iraq.â
| 43, On February 28, 2007, Iraqi Agent sent Business Director a letter |

enclosing the official MoO report for the MMT field trial test and noting his success in
making sure that the MMT test failed âagainst all odds.â Iragi Agent also enclosed a
$50,000 invoice to Innospec, saying that he had been required to pay an extra $50,000 to
ensure that the MMT report came out in fnnospeeâs favor. |

44. On April 3, 2007, Innospec reimbursed tragi Agent for the additional
$50,000 payment. The two payments totaling $155,000 were improperly booked as |
legitimate commission payments. .

45. Aside from paying $155,000 up front to ensure that the MMT test failed,
Iragi Agent, on Alcorâs behalf, also promised additional bribes to Iraqi officials in
connection with future TEL orders. In an e-mail dated March 21, 2007, to Business
Director, Iragi Agent described how he would use his 5% commission from remaining
shipments in 2007 and the new LTPA âto cover my promise to these people for the loss
of their remuneration from MMT, which is a very small price we are paying versus the
loss of my money and your money if MMT were admitted in.â

46. In the end, Alcorâs efforts to sabotage Iraqâs use of MMT were successful
and in January 2008 Alcor executed a second LTPA with the MoO. The agreement took

effect in June 2008 and on February 24, 2009, the MoO opened a letter of credit in favor

il
of Alcor for $17,000,000. Had the agreement zone forward, 5% of the $17,000,000, Le.
- $850,000, would presumably have been shared with Iraqi officials via Alcorâs agent.

47. > The agreement, however, did not go forward. The negotiations leading up
to the agreement were tainted by bribery, and as a result, the 2008 LTPA was not
performed and Innospec did not pay its agent any commissions on the contract.

Cc. âInnospec Paid Travel and Entertainment Expenses for MoO Officials

48. In order to incur good will with the MoO and ensure that it continued to
receive TEL orders, Innospec paid bribes to Iraq by funding lavish trips for Iraqi officials
from 2002 through at least 2006.

49. For example, in 2002 Innospec, through Iraqi Agent, offered to send a
delegation of Iraqi officials to visit Alcorâs offices in Zug, Switzerland at an estimated
cost of $36,500. The trip was to include âSn principle one morming office visit and ithe]
rest, tourism.â

50, In June 2005, Innospec arranged for fragi Agent to pay $22,732 to cover
the costs of a trip by cight Iraqi officials to Innospecâs Ellesmere plant in the UK. The |
2005 trip expenses included hotel accommodations, food and transportation casts, as well
as the provision of approximately $1,800 in âpocket moneyâ for seven of the officials and
approximately $3,600 for the eighth official, who -was head of the iraqi delegation.

31. In another instance, Iraqi Agent submitted an invoice dated March 12,
2006, to Innospec for reimbursement of $13,750 for expenses related toa trip taken by

MoO officials to a 2006 Oil refining conference in Dubai. The invoice covered air fare,

hotel accommodations, and pocket money for three high level government officials and
described the pocket money as âper diem payments as required by the Iraqi Ministry of
Oi.â |
52. Finally, in 2006, Innospec paid $1 3,076 for a trip taken by a MoO official

- to Jordan and then Thailand for a seven day honeymoon. Innospecâs payment covered
hotel accommodations, food, and transportation costs within Thailand. |

33. On January 30, 2008, tragi Agent submitted another invoice to Alcor for
reimbursement of $34,480 for travel costs incurred by Iraqi Mo0 officials who traveled
to Lebanon to finalize the 2008 LTPA with Alcor. Due to the ongoing investigations
being conducted by U.S. regulators, Alcor never paid the invoice, which sought
reimbursement for hotel accommodations, food, mobile phone cards, three cameras and
$15,060 in âpocket moneyâ for officials.

Iv. INNOSPEC PAID BRIBES TO INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT |
OFFICIALS AT STATE OWNED OIL AND GAS COMPANIES

54. Aside from its illicit conduct in Iraq, Innospec also paid bribes to
Indonesian government officials from at least 2000 through 2005 in order to win
contracts for the sale of TEL to state owned oil and gas companies in Indonesia. The
bribes were made through Indonesian Agent and totaled approximately $2,883,507.
Innospecâs revenues in connection with the illicit bribes were approximately $48,571,937
and profits were $21,506,610. |

A. Innospec paid Bribes to an Official at BP Micas in order to Generate
More Tel Sales

5S. From 2000 until approximately 2005, Imospec used Indonesian Agent and

bis company to pay bribes of approximately $1,323,507 to Official X of the Ministry of

13
Energy and Mineral Resources and who later became a senior official at BP Migas, an
Indonesian state owned oi and gas company.

56. The scheme was outlined in an e-mail dated January 8, 2001 from
Managing Director to Business Director stating that m 2000 and 2001 Imnospec agreed to
pay Official X $40 per MT for all TEL orders in excess of 4000 tons and $50 per MT for
all TEL orders in excess of 5,000 tons. Based on the volume of TEL sold to BP Migas,

. Innospec owed Official X $261,055 in 2000 and $294,970 in 2001.

37. ""In order to pay the bribes, Indonesian Agent submitted two fictitious
invoices for $265,000 and $295,150 to Innospec, falsely describing the payments as
reimbursements relating to Pertamina/Migas/Lemigas travel and other costs âin the
promotion of Octelâs products, as earlier agreed.â

58.  Pertamima, BP Migas and Lemigas are all Indonesian state owned oil and |
gas companies. On January 9, 2001, Innospec paid the invoice for $265,000, and on
January 8, 2002, it paid the $295,150. Both payments were approved by Managing
Director and in both cases Innospec falsely recorded the bribes, booking the J anuaty
2061 payment as âlegal feesâ and the January 2002 payment as a âsales commission.â |

59. The bribery likely continued until 2005, when Indonesia converted to

unleaded fuel and no longer needed TEL. On June 19, 2001, Managing Director sent
Business Director an e-mail regarding âPertamina pricing 2002 and on,â and recapped the
terms of a new payment arrangement with Indonesian Agent that had recently been
agreed upon with Executive A, saying that the new arrangement would be âcompletely
separate and in addition to.... the [payments to the Official X] fund that is agreed

annually in advance and paid annually in arrears once the required tonnage is achieved.â

14
B.  iInnospec made Improper Payments to an Account at Pictet Bank
in Switzerland in Exchange for TEE Orders from Pertamima

60. In 2000 and 2001, Innospec also made payments to government officials
at Pertamina, another state owned oil company related fo BP Migas. In an undated letter
addressed to Executive C, a company employee said that Octel had âagreed toa special
coramission for TEL salesâ in exchange for obtaining 100% of Pertaminaâs TEL business
from 2000 to 2003. |

61. The letter identified a bank account at Pictet & Cie (âPictetâ) a privately
owned bank in Geneva, Switzerland, which would receive the âspecial commissionâ -
payments. Accordingly, in 2000 Innospec wired a total of $400,000 to the Pictet account
and in 2001 it wired an additional $300,000. Innospec booked the payments as âsales
commissions.â

cy Innospec Paid Bribes to a Government Official at Pertamina in Order
to Sell 446.4 Metric Tons of TEL |

62. In addition to the payments to Official X of BP Migas and to Pertamina
officials through the use of the Pictet account, Business Director and Indonesian Agent
on Innospecâs behalf also bribed other officials at Pertamina in order to influence their
decisions regarding TEL purchases.

63. . For instance, on December 18, 2003, an employee of Indonesian Agent e-
âxnailed Business Director saying that Indonesian Agent had just returned from a meeting
with Official Y of Pertamina and that Official Y had said he would help Octel, but he
wanted more than yast âcentsâ in return.

64. On May 14, 2004, the same employee e-mailed Business Director to say

that Indonesian Agent had been working hard to try and stop Indonesian officials from

i5
switching to unleaded fuel in January 2005, and that Indonesian Agent âmight need some
extra money to support the Lead Defense activitiesâ in Indonesia.

65. In an e-mail dated August 16, 2004, to management, Business Director
said that the entire Board of Pertamina had been replaced and that âthe old position of
[Official Y was] no more.â Business Director added that Official Yâs role would be filled
by Official Z, a senior Pertamina official who was well known to Innospec and was being
checked. |

66. InJ anuary, 2005, Indonesian Agent secured an order on Innospecâs behalf
for 446.4 metric tons of TEL from Pertarnina. In exchange, Innospec, through Business
Director , agreed to a âone off paymentâ of $300,000 to Indonesian Agent with the
understanding that it would be passed on to Official Z at Pertamina.

67. The payment was arranged in two parts. First, Innospec increased
Indonesian Agentâs commission on the order from 6% to 10%, leading to an extra
payment of $184,363.20, which was credited to the agentâs account in Singapore. To
cover the balance, Business Director told Indonesian Agent to submit an invoice for
$115,636.81 to Innospec, and provided the fictitious language that he wanted included in
the invoice to justify the payment.

68. | On February 8, 2005, Indonesian Agent sent Business Director an e-mail
saying that be had opened an account for Official Z and that Official Z had called
requesting his balance payment. On February 14, 2005, Indonesian Agent submitted the
' $115,636.81 invoice to Innospec, and Business Director and Executive B approved it.

On March 18, 2005, Innospec credited the invoice payment to Indonesian Agentâs

16
account in Singapore. Innospec falsely booked the entire $300,000 payment to
Indonesian Agent as âsales commissions.â

69, In order to ensure that Official Z approved the 446.4 MT order, Innospec
also paid for a trip taken by Official Z and his family to the UK in April 2005.
Innospecâs revenues on the sale of 446.4 metric tons of TEL to Pertamina were
$4,796,155 and its profits were $1,898,571. |

v. INNOSPEC COMMITTED ANTI-BRIBERY, INTERNAL CONTROLS,
AND BOOKS AND RECORDS VIOLATIONS

70. Innospec made millions im illicit payments and promised payments, either
directly or indirectly, to Iraqi | government officials during the post-Oil for Food period
and to Indonesian government officials for the purpose of influencing their decisions and
obtaining or retaining business through the sale of TEL. innospec, a U.S. issuer, made
use of U.S. mails and interstate commerce to carry out the scheme, and at least one US.
person and officer was complicit in the scheme.

71.  Inconnection with all of the illicit payments in Iraq, including the Oil forâ
Food payments, as well as the payments in Indonesia, Innospec failed to make and keep
accurate books, records and accounts. Many of the bribes were mischaracterized as
legitimate commissions, travel and legal fees in Innospecâs books and records.

72, Moreover, as evidenced by ihe extent and duration of the improper
payments to foreign officials made by Innospec, the improper. recording of these
payments in Innospecâs books and records, the failure of Innospecâs former management
to detect these irregularities, and the significant involvement of certain members of

rnanagement at the highest levels of the company, Innospec failed to devise and maintain

17
an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect these anti-bribery and books
and records violations.

SEC Charges Innospec for Illegal Bribes to Iraqi and
Indonesian Officials

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-40

Washington, D.C., March 18, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange
Commission today charged Innospec, Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) by engaging in widespread bribery of foreign government
officials in Iraq and Indonesia to obtain and retain business.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 21454
Â» SEC Complaint

 

Innospec, a specialty chemical company incorporated in Delaware with
principal offices in the U.S. and United Kingdom, agreed to a $40.2 million
global settlement with the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S.
Department of the Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the
United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office (SFO).

According to the SECâs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, Innospec routinely paid millions of dollars in bribes to sustain its
sales of tetraethyl lead (TEL) to state-owned refineries and oil companies in
Iraq and Indonesia. Innospec also paid kickbacks to Iraqi officials in order to
obtain contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program.

âThis investigation exposed more than $9.2 million in illegal bribes paid or
promised to officials in Iraq and Indonesia,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of
the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThis enforcement action makes clear that
law enforcement authorities within the U.S. and across the globe are working
together to aggressively monitor violators of anti-corruption laws.â

Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SECâs Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit,
added, âInnospecâs long-standing practice of bribing government officials was
particularly egregious given the role of management, which authorized and
condoned the misconduct.â

The SECâs complaint alleges that Innospecâs internal controls failed to detect
the illicit conduct, which took place from 2000 to 2007. Innospec made illicit
payments of more than $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in
illicit payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as
Indonesian government officials. The contracts that Innospec obtained in
exchange for the bribes were worth approximately $176 million.

The SEC alleges that Innospec obtained five Oil-for-Food Program contracts
for the sale of TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries.
Innospec paid kickbacks on three of the contracts equaling 10 percent of the
contract value, and the company promised kickbacks on the other two
contracts. Innospec increased its agentâs commission as a means to funnel
the payments to Iraq, and artificially inflated its prices in the contracts. The
Oil-for-Food Program ended shortly before Innospec was to pay the promised
kickbacks on the two remaining contracts, Innospec kept the promised
payments as part of its profit. Innospec then continued to pay bribes to Iraqi
officials to win more business. One Innospec agent wrote in an internal e-mail:
âWe are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our
business will stop and we will lose the market. We have to change our
strategy and do more compensation to get the rewards.â

According to the SECâs complaint, Innospec paid lavish travel and
entertainment expenses for Iraqi Ministry of Oil officials, including the seven-
day honeymoon of one official. Innospec supplied mobile phone cards and
cameras, and paid thousands of dollars in cash to officials for âpocket
money.â Innospec also paid bribes to ensure the failure of a 2006 field test of
MMT, a fuel product manufactured by one of Innospecâs competitors.

The SEC alleges that Innospec had several schemes to pay bribes to
Indonesian government officials to win contracts. More than $2.8 million in
bribes was funneled through an Indonesian agent. One scheme involved
bribes paid annually to a senior official at BP Migas and another scheme
involved âspecial commissionsâ paid to a Swiss account. Innospecâs bribes to
Indonesian officials supported the companyâs efforts to maintain TEL sales in
Indonesia at a time when the country was planning to go unleaded. According
to the SECâs complaint, one official indicated that he would assist Innospec in
obtaining TEL sales but that he wanted more than just âcentsâ in return.

According to the SECâs complaint, Innospec violated Section 30A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by engaging in bribery of government
officials in Iraq during the post-Oil for Food period and government officials in
Indonesia. Innospec violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by
failing to maintain internal controls to detect and prevent bribery of officials in
Iraq and Indonesia as well as the illicit Oil for Food Program kickbacks.
Innospec violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly
recording all of the illicit payments in its books.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Innospec has consented
to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining the company from future
violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
The company agreed to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA
compliance program, including an independent monitor for a period of three
years. Innospec agreed to pay $11.2 million in disgorgement to the SEC, a
criminal fine of $14.1 million to the DOJ, and a criminal fine of $12.7 million to
the U.K.âs SFO. Innospec will pay $2.2 million to OFAC.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the DOJâs Fraud Section, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, OFAC, and the U.K.âs SFO in this matter.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges
that:

| SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1. From at least 1998 through 2008, Daimler AG, formerly known as â

DaimlerChrysler AG Daimlerâ or the âCompanyâ), and certain of its subsidiaries and affihates,
violated the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act ( the âFCPAâ) by making illicit payments, directly or indirectly, to foreign
government officials in order to secure and maintain business worldwide. a

2. During this time period, Daimler paid bribes to government officials to further
government sales in Asia, Africa, Basten Europe and the Middle East. In connection with at
least 31 transactions, Daimler violated the anti-bribery provision of the FCPA by paying tens of

millions of dollars in corrupt payments to foreign government officials to secure business in
- Russia, China, Vietnam, Nigeria, Hungary, Latvia, Croatia and Bosnia. These corrupt payments
were made through the use of U.S. mails or the means or instrumentality of U.S. interstate
commerce. |

3. _ Daimler also violated the FCPAâs books and records and internal controls
provisions in connection with the 51 transactions and at least an additional 154 transactions, in
which it made improper payments totaling at least $56 million to secure business in 22 countries,
including, among others, Russia, China, Nigeria, Vietnam, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, North
Korea, and Indonesia. Through these tainted sales transactions, which involved at least 6,300
commercial vehicles and 500 passenger cars, Daimler earned $1.9 billion in revenue and at least
$91 A million in illegal profits, |

4. | Nineteen of these transactions, which occurred between approximately 2001
through 2003, involved direct and indirect sales of motor vehicles and spare parts under the
United Nations Oil for Food Program. Those transactions included $6,048,948 in bribes in the
form of under-the-table âafter sales service fees.â Daimler offered to pay kickbacks of more
than $1 million under Six direct contracts with lragi ministries; made one payment of $7,134
under a direct contract; and knowingly acquiesced in the payment of another $5 million in |
âkickbacks by its contract partners in connection with twelve indirect Oil for Food contracts.

5 OA number of Daimlerâs former senior executives, who operated in a decentralized
corporate structure, permitted or were directly involved in the Companyâs bribery practices, .
including the head of its overseas sales department, who reported directly to the Companyâs most
senior officers, The Company's internal audit, legal, and finance and accounting depariments,
which should have provided checks on the activities of the sales force, instead played important

roles in the subversion of internal controls and obfuscation of corporate records.
6. The improper payments were made possible in part as a result of the falsification
of corporate records and a lax system of internal controls. .

7. In this environment, Daimler developed several organized procedures and
mechanisms through which improper payments could be made. Daimlerâs books and records
contained over 200 ledger accounts, known internally as âinterne Fremdkonten,â of, âinternal
third party accounts,â which reflected credit balances controlled by Daimler subsidiaries or
outside third parties. Certain Daimler employees used numerous such accounts to make or
facilitate improper payments to foreign government officials. Bribes were also made through the
use of âcorporate cash desksâ (where sales executives would obtain cash in amounts as high as |
400,000 Deutsche Marks for making improper payments), deceptive pricing and commission
arrangements, phony sales intermediaries, rogue business partners and misuse of inter-company
and debtor accounts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. This court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of
| the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C, Â§878u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. Daimler, directly or indirectly, made
use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a
national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of â
business alleged in this Complaint. | a

9. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 ,
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because Daimler, as a US. issuer, files required periodic reports with the

Commission in this fudicial district.
DEFENDANT

10. Daimler, a publicly-held corporation organized under the laws of the Federal
Republic of Germany, is a global company primarily engaged in manufacturing automobiles.
The Company is headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany: The Companyâs common stock is
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 781(b)] of the Exchange
Act and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where its stock is traded under the symbol
DAL

FACTS

ll. From at least 1998, employees of Daimler and certain of its subsidiaries and
affiliates made imaproper payments to foreign government officials to further sales in many |
counties. This conduct dates back toa time when such payments were not prohibited by
German law, and therefore were tax deductible according to the German Tax Code.

12. Daimler internally referred to these payments as âN.A.â payments, which was the
abbreviation of the German term muiitzliche Aufwendungen, meaning âuseful expendituresâ or
âuseful payments.â

13. | In February 1999, Germany outlawed foreign bribery when the Organization for
7 Economic Cooperation and Development (âOECDâ) Anti-Bribery Convention, which Germany
ratified, entered into force. Daimler, however, had been prohibited from making bribes to
foreign government officials under the FCPA since 1993 when its predecessor, Daimler-Benz
AG, registered a class of securities under Â§ 12 of the Exchange Act.

14, Notwithstanding its status as a U.S. issuer, the Company failed to end its long-

standing bribery practices and bring its overseas sales business into compliance with the FCPA.

 

! Up until the divestiture of Daimlexâs Chrysler division in May 2007, the Company was known as
DaimlerChrysler AG, which was the product of the 1998 merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation.
iS. in tact, until recently, Daimlerâs FCPA compliance program, outside its former
U.S.-based Chrysler division, was virtually non-existent, even though the Company has
thousands of employees and dozens of affiliates and business units selling vehicles to foreign
governments and government-related entities in many foreign countries.
16. Although Daimler adopted a corporate Integrity Code in July 1999, which
. included anti-bribery provisions, it failed to adequately enforce those provisions or train
| employees outside the U.S. on FCPA compliance.

17. Daimler also failed to implement meaningful oversight of the activities of its sales
force. Accounting and legal personnel often reported to top sales management, rather than
independent, centralized departments with compliance functions. In several instances, in fact,
Daimlerâs legal and accounting departments aided the corrupt practices of the sales departments
rather than provide a safeguard against such practices. |

18. Daimler also failed to maintain adequate controls over the selection of, or
payments to, sales intermediaries, many of whom were actually nominees for government
officials, or over the establishment and use of bank accounts.

19. Daimler and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates utilized a variety of
instruments to make improper payments in at least 22 countries around the world.

20. The instruments through which improper payments were made included hundreds
of ledger accounts on Daimlerâs own books, corporate âcash desksâ (where sales personnel!
would obtain cash), deceptive pricing. and commission arrangements, offshore bank accounts,
inflated service fees, and nominees for government officials improperly described as âsales

intermediariesâ and âconsultants.â
Zi. Daimlerâs practice of securing business through the payment of bnibes to foreign
government officials permeated to several major business units and. subsidiaries and was
sanctioned by its senior management. Daimlerâs corrupt practices were carried out by major
department heads of Daimler Overseas Sales and Commercial Vehicles. |

22, Similarly, improper payments were authorized by or known to the former heads
_ of Daimilerâs Overseas Sales and Commercial Vehicles departments, the former heads of Daimler

Export and Trade Finance (a subsidiary of Daimler Financial Services), and the former heads of |
Daimierâs subsidiaries in Vietnam, China, Turkey, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Russia and
the EvoBus subsidiary (âEvoBusââ).
A. Daimler Used âThird-Partyâ Ledger Accounts to Facilitate Bribes
23. When Daimler-Benz AG merged with Chrysler Corp. in November 1998, Daimler
maintained over 200 ledger accounts known as âinternal third party accountsâ âTPAâ or
âTPAsâ}, referred to in German as interne Fremdkonten, which were used for numerous business
purposes. Since at least 1977, Daimler maintained written policies governing the operation of
TPAs. Daimlerâs Overseas Sales department (Overseas Salesâ) in many instances misused
certain of these TPAs to facilitate improper payments to foreign government officials in Africa,
Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
24. Certain TPAs were managed by the most senior Overseas Sales executives,
including the former head of Overseas Sales. The former head of finance and controlling for
- Overseas Sales and the then heads of certain Daimler subsidiaries also authorized disbursements
from TPAs. .
25. Although the TPAs were internal Daimler general ledger accounts and managed

by employees of Daimler and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, the funds in certain of the
TPAs were disbursed according to structions given by third-party beneficiaries of the accounts,
including government officials. Such credits recorded in the TPAsâusually were disbursed in
cash or by wiring the money to bank accounts throughout the world.

26. Some of the TPAs were known only to the few Daimler employees managing
_ them, and payments from the accounts were often confidential, meaning that funds credited to

and debited from these accounts and cash disbursements were often not transparent or subject to
a paper trail or other financial controls.

27. Given the unregulated nature of these accounts, over time, TPAs were used to
forward large sums of cash throughout the world, assist Daimlerâs outside business partners and
subsidiaries evade taxes in their respective countries of operation and pay salaries for Daimler
expatriate employees working overseas, which, in effect, improperly shielded these funds from
German tax authorities,

28. Daimler maintained several TPAs on its general ledger in the name ofits own
overseas subsidiaries, which were controlled by the then heads of the subsidiaries and former
Overseas Sales senior executives and used to facilitate government deals.

29. In other cases, TPAs were maintained in Daimlerâs general ledger in the names of
third parties outside the Company, including foreign government officials or Daimlerâs dealers, |
âdistributors or other agents, who were at times used as intermediaries to make payments to

foreign government officials.

30. Daimler, for example, maintained a TPA called âConsulting Egyptâ for the
benefit of a senior official of a government-owned factory that purchased Daimler chassis and

parts and assembled and sold personnel carriers to the Egyptian Army. From 1998 to 2004,
Daimler paid the official through credits to the TPA 1,123,224 Deutsche Mark (âDMâ) and later
â¬322,101 to secure the sale of Vehicle chassis and fire trucks to the factory.
31.  TPAs were also funded by money obtained from the government customers

oF 66,

themselves through one of several bogus pricing mechanisms, such as âprice surcharges,â âpnce

93

inchisions,â or excessive coramissions, âdiscountsâ or ârebates.â

32. These artificial pricing mechanisms were used by Daimler or its agent to build a
reserve into the price the povernment customer paid for the vehicle, which was credited (Ze.,
kicked back} into a TPA and later paid out as a bribe-to or for the benefit of foreign government
officials. In the case of artificial discounts or rebates on sales contracts, all or a portion of the
discount would be kicked back, through the TPA, toa foreign government official, rather than
the purchasing government customer. |

33. | Under this scenario, Daimler held the money generated from a fraudulent pricing
arrangement ina TPA until the TPA beneficiary or Daimler subsidiary or agent directed a
transfer of the funds. Daimler, however, did not accumulate any interest or other charges for
maintaining these funds for its account holders and the funds could be carried on the Companyâs
books indefinitely.

34. Prior to 2002, Daimierâs TPA policies also permitted senior executives, including
the former head of Overseas Sales, the former head of finance and controlling for Overseas Sales
and former heads of subsidiaries, to authorize cash disbursements from TPAs.

35. The cash was disbursed from a âcash deskâ located at a Daimler facility in
Stuttgart, Germany, and a corresponding debit was booked to the relevant TPA.

36. Daimler failed to adequately monitor where cash was being directed or whether

cash disbursements were being made for legitimate business purposes.
37. In connection with its government customers in Nigeria, for example, Daimler
employees withdrew DM 400,000 and $150,000 from the cash desk and transported the Marks

and us dollars to Nigeria to pay bribes to foreign government officials. |

38. In 2002, Daimler closed its cash desk in Stuttgart, but cash payments continued to
be made through its subsidiaries or through offshore bank accounts. Daimler mstituted new
policies in 2002 requiring the beneficiaries of TPAs to designate a âreference bank accountâ to
which payments could be wired or otherwise transferred (eliminating the need for cash

. disbursements). However, the policies did not require that the barik account be maintained ina
; country m which the account holder resided or whereâ the services of the bank account
beneficiary. were purportedly rendered. |
1. Dairaler Paid Bribes Through TPAs in Nigeria

39. Daimler made bribe payments and kept funds that were not properly recorded on
âits books through four TPAs that were held âby Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company
(âAnammeoâ), a then Daimler-controlled joint venture between Daimler and the Federal Military
_ Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, through which Daimler sold vehicles into
| Nigeria. Daimler sold its interest in the joint venture m 2007.

46. 2A portion of Daimlerâs proceeds from the sale of vehicles in Nigeria was credited
to the Ariaramco TPAs. Senior executives of Dairaler then used a portion of these credits to fund
improper payments to foreign governmeit officials. a |

41. Between 1998 and 2005, Daimler paid approximately DM 3.9 million, $1 million
and â¬230,000 in improper payments to Nigerian government officials. The bribe payments from _
the Anammeo TPAs were made to secure sales contracts worth approximately $73 million with

at least seven different government customers. These payments were either improperly recorded .
in Daimlerâs books and records or were not recorded at all and were made as a result of weak
internal controls. _
42. The Anammeo TPAs were controlled by the former head of Overseas Sales and
""the former head of Daimlerâs Nigerian office through which Daimler carried out its business in
Nigeria (the âNigerian representative officeâ), who also Was the managing director of Anammco.
These two former executives had decision-making authority over the sales operations in Nigeria,
and they were able to direct large scale bribe payments.

43. For example, in order to obtain a deal to sell armored vehicles to the Nigerian:
government, the former head of Overseas Sales authorized the former head of Daimlerâs
Nigerian representative office to debit an Anammco TPA and pay DM 200,000 and DM 50,000,
respectively, to two senior Nigerian government officials, who had decision-making authority
over the contract. Daimler employees then wired the famds to the personal foreign bank accounts
of these two officials in England and Germany. |

44. Similarly, in order to obtain another deal involving the sale of cormmercial
vehicles toa Nigerian state-owned entity, the former head of the Nigerian representative office
effectuated a debit of nearly â¬200,000 from an Anaramco TPA and had the funds wired from a

Daimler bank account in Germany to a bank account in England held by the entityâs managing _ |
director. | | -

a5. The former head of Overseas Sales and the former head of the Nigerian

ârepresentative office also routinely withdrew large sums of cash in various currencies from |
Daimlerâs corporate cash desk in Germany to make bribe payments to secure business in Nigeria,
| 46. Daimler failed to adequately monitor the amount of cash that could be withdrawn

through the cash desk or understand the purpose of the withdrawals. The former head of the

10
Nigerian representative office, for example, was authorized by the former head of Overseas Sales
to debit an Anammco TPA to obtain DM 400,000 in cash from the cash desk for use towards the |
hotel stay, travel, dining and shopping of a senior Nigerian government official, his delegation
and their relatives.

47. in connection with the contract to sell buses to a Nigerian state-owned entity, the -
former head of the Nigeria representative office withdrew $110,000 in cash from the cash desk
and delivered the fonds from Germany to Nigeria io make bribe payments to government
officials affiliated with the entity. |

48. Atone point, the former head of the Nigerian representative office and a senior
sales manager for Anamimco opened up at least two Swiss bank accounts, which were funded by
credit balances in Anammco TPAs. -

49. The former head of Overseas Sales authorized approximately DM 2.1 million to
be transferred from Anammco TPAs into these Swiss bank accounts for payment to government
officials to obtain sales contracts with various agencies of the Nigerian government.

2. Star Aute, S.A.

50. Daimler made a series of bribe payments through a TPA that was maintained for
the benefit of Star Auto 8.A. (âStar Autoâ), at the time a Daimler majority-owned and controlled
entity based in the Ivory Coast. - |

51. Star Auto operated as Daimnlerâs general dealer in the Ivory Coast, and sales
intermediary when direct sales were made between Overseas Sales and West African customers.
Star Auto operated a regional center for coordinating sales in 14 West African countries.

Daimler sold its interest in Star Auto in 2008.

il -
52. The former head of Overseas Sales, the former head of finance and controlling for
Overseas Sales, and the former managing director of Star Auto controlled the Star Auto TPA.

53. The three former Daimler executives also controlled an off-the-books German
bank account at Volksbank, which was used in conjunction with the Star Auto TPA to make |
improper payments and existed outside Daimlerâs accounting system. |

(54. âThrough the Star Auto TPA and the bank account at Volksbank, the three former
_ executives made improper payments to government officials in Ghana, Liberia and Poland in the

amounts of DM 630,000, $1 70,000 and â¬111,175, securing at least $24.5 million in vehicle sales
between 1998 and 2004. | |
55. The three former executives disguised the true purpose of the payments from the
Star Auto TPA, which resulted in inaccuracies in Daimlerâs books and records.
56. F or example, in an effort to enter the trucking market in Poland through the sale
| of 30 trucks to a Polish government entity and establishment of a local office in Warsaw, in 2004
former Daimler executives made cash bribe payments totaling â¬100,000 to a high ranking Polish
government official who represented the government entity in the deal. The cash was withdrawn
from the Star Auto account at Volksbank against credit balances in the Star Auto TPA and
| personally delivered by the former head of Overseas Sales and another senior Overseas Sales
executive to the government official at a hotel room in Stattgart, Germany. The former -
managing director of Star Auto then improperly noted in an internal memo that â¬60,000 of the
â¬100,000 was paid in connection with âservice expenses for major Polish customers (Mail road
construction project).â Similarly, the remaining â¬40,000 cash payment was improperly
referenced in an internal document as a payment for âconsulting services with regard to the

Warsaw. branch office for trucks.â

12
57. In other deals where Daimler used the Star Auto TPA to make the bribe
payments, the Company used phony intermediaries or its own outside dealers to dispuise the true
nature and purpose of the payments. |

58. Daimler, for example, obtained a sales contract to supply 100 trucks to the
| government of Liberia by providing a free armored Mercedes G 500 vehicle worth nearly
$600,000 to a senior Liberian government official. Daimler then arranged to pay its outside
dealer in Liberia $600,000, which was mischaracterized as commissions, and which the dealer
then used to pay for the vehicle. This deceptive structuring of the deal made it appear as if the
dealer purchased the vehicle when, i fact, Daimler employees gifted the vehicle to the Liberian
government official as a bribe | |

3. Dabmnler Refuses te Stop Using TPAS te Make Bribes Despite Risks
59. For many years, Daimler used TPAs to make bribes despite being aware of the
legal risks associated with the accounts. |

60. An internal audit report, dated March 24, 1986, acknowledged that the accounts |
might violate the laws of other countries and that disclosure of the TPAs to certain governments
could pose âsignificant difficultiesâ for the Company as well as the beneficiaries of the accounts.

61. | Consequently, pursuant to corporate policy, TPAs were maintained with âabsolute

confidentialityâ and only âin the knowledge of a few. [Daimler] employees.â

| 62. | After foreign bribery became âillegal : in Germany i in 1999, Daimlerâs internal audit
department placed semor executives at the Company on notice that mternal control weaknesses
associated with the TPAs left the accounts susceptible to being used for bribery.

63. The former head of intemal audit for Daimlerâs operations outside of North

America became concerned that the approximately 200 TPAs in existence at that time would _

43
~ continue to be used for effectuating bribes, as had been Daimlerâs practice prior to the change in
German law. Concerned about this risk and possible misuse of the TPAs, in early 2000, the
internal audit head directed his internal audit staff to conduct a review of all the Companyâs
TPAs.

64. Ina May 2000 memo to senior sales and finance personnel, Daimlerâs internal
audit staff warned that there was a hi gh risk that the TPAs did not comport with either the
Companyâs Integrity Code or changed German law. Another internal audit memo stated that, by
not revising | guidelines over the use of TPAs, the Company could be viewed as facilitating
âfraudul ent transactions within the organization.â

65. The May 2000 memo further noted that, given the lack of internal controls over
TPAs, internal audit could be held responsible for failing to take remedial measures should.
certain transactions occur and become public..

66. . Accordingly, the May 2000 memo recommended that internal audit, among other .
things, review all TPAs to determine whether commission payments were legitimate, conduct -
audits of all operational sales departments to âidentify favors granted that might be problematic
from a legal point of view. and cancelling them as soon as possible,â and obligate ali Daimler
contract partners to provide written confirmation that no commission or resale price margins
would be passed through fo âsub agents,â 7 |

67. Inthe same memo, internal audit also recommended to senior executives of
Overseas Sales and the finance and accounting department that the Company: (1) close the TPAs
""unless there is documented proof that the funds in TPAs are necessary for legitimate business

purposes; (2) obtain documented proof of actual services rendered by an outside agent and

14
business partners before paying commissions: and (3} obtain representations that commissions _
are not passed through to âsub agents.â - |

68.. In August 2000, the internal audit staff created a formal audit report entitled
âReview of Internal Control Procedures Invoicing Process GFN/Lâ that addressed internal
controls risks surrounding TPAs.

69. The summary of the andit report, which was sent to certain members of the Board
of Management, reflected that âthe correctness of invoice processing and settlement of -
commissions/discounts are subject to serious risks,â including the â[albsence of central
âobligatory internal controls principles forthe respective business unitsâ of the Company. The
sumunary further stated that such internal controls issues increase the risk of fraud and |
âendangers the adherence to the [Companyâs] Integrity code.â .

70. The body of the August 2000 report, which was sent to senior finance and sales
executives, went on to further state that internal controls surrounding the invoicing, commission
payments and rebate accounting in the sales organization were weak, lacked central oversight
and subjected Daimler to fraud risks,

71. The body of the report further noted that there were âfundamental gaps in
securityâ in the way the sales organization paid commissions and invoiced customers âwhich

will necessarily lead to serious risks of fraudulent acts to the detriment of [Daimler] and to
corresponding risks with respect to compliance with the Integrity Code.â | |

72. Despite such warnings from internal audit, those who received the summary and
body of the internal audit report failed to direct the Companyâs accounting department to |

improve internal controls surrounding the TPAs, let alone close the accounts.

15
73. | The Board of Management failed to direct internal audit to audit the TPAs and
associated bank accounts to determine whether the TPAs were operating in compliance with
anti-bribery laws.

. 74. Daimierâs internal audit staff also faced pressure to keep TPAs open from former
= senior Overseas Sales executives, such as the former head of Overseas Sales and the former head
of fmance and controlling for Overseas. Sales, who feared a potential loss of sales volume ifthe -
TPAs were eliminated. As reflected in internal audit memos, former Overseas Sales
management also resisted improvements in internal controls and transparency for the TPAs.

75. | In 2002, although the Company decided to reduce the number of TPAs to 5 0 and
_ shut down its central cash desk, cash payments continued to be made through cash desks and
bank accounts controlled by its subsidiaries, and the Company failed to effectively improve __
controls surrounding the remaining TPAs. |

76.  TheSO TPAs remained open over the objections of the internal audit head, and his
departmentâs efforts to rein in the use of TPAs was hampered by Daimlerâs decentralized
corporate structure and, according to the internal audit head, the Companyâs expectation that
' internal audit not serve a âpolice function.â

WT internal audit ultimately recommended that senior sales managementâthe
. individuals most responsible for directing bribes to secure sales~conduct a âself-auditâ to
determine whether bribes were paid from the TPAs. The remaining open TPAs were closed in
2004 and 2005, only. after the Commission began its investigation. .
B. Daimler Used Other Ledger Accounts to Facilitate Bribes
8. Jn addition io TPAs, Daimler used a variety of other ledger accounts to make

corrupt payments to foreign government officials to secure vehicle sales and other business.

16
79. Similar to TPAs, the money in the other ledger accounts used for bribes was often
generated from fraudulent pricing arrangernents.

80. In connection with certain sales of passenger cars in Russia and conumercial
vehicles in China, for example, Daimler and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates routinely
over-invoiced the government customers between 10%-30% for phony add-ons such as parts or
services that were not delivered (and never intended to be delivered), resulting in an
overpayment of the inflated contract price. The excess amount was then passed on to high-
ranking government officials through credits to inter-company and debtor accounts associated
with the respective transactions, which were then transferred to bank accounts designated by
foreign government officials,

81. The improper payments to government officials or their designees through these _
ledger accounts were either not recorded on Daimlerâs books and records or inaccurately
recorded to disguise the true nature of the payments.

82. Daimler, for example, sold passenger cars to two Russian governmental entities.
Daimler maintained on its. books credit balances that were also used by certain Daimler
employees to make improper payments to bank accounts designated by government officials
associated with the two Russian governmental entities. Credits to these accounts were
mislabeled as âcommissions,â or âspecial discounts,â or identified as NLAâ

83. In connection with government sales in Vietnam, former senior sales executives at
Daimlerâs MB Vietnam subsidiary improperly booked corrupt payments in several expense
accounts designated as.ââKey Accounts,â Costs of Goad Sold, âGifts Line,â âPetty Cash,â and. |

âBroker Commissions.â

17
84. Likewise, Daimilerâs Indonesian subsidiary misused âemployee vendor accounts,â
which were intended for booking employee travel-related expenses, for booking large cash
disbursements to officials from a state-owned company. Many of these payments were also
characterized as âfulfillment of commitmentâ on internal payment authorization sheets and were
improperly booked on Daimlerâs corporate accounting system as âcost of goods sold.â

85. Cash was also withdrawn against certain âomnibusâ accounts and noted on
âpayment instructions as âto be handed to the customerâ without recording the true nature of the
payment on Daimilerâs books. |

86. In connection with the sale of a commercial vehicle to a government customer in
Russia, for instance, former Daimler employees made cash payments to two government officials
totaling DM 9,191.34. Both payments were referenced internally as âsocial supportâ payments.
At least one of these payments was evidenced by a receipt signed by a government official. A
former employee of Daimlerâs subsidiary in Russia, pursuant to orders from superiors, withdrew
these funds from his own bank account in Germany, flew to Russia with the cash in a suitcase,
paid the officials in cash, and was later reimbursed by Daimler.

c. Daimler Paid Kickbacks in Connection with the United Nations Oil
for Food Program

 

87. Daimler's involvement in the payment of bribes through the Oil for Food Progratn
took two forms -- direct sales and indirect sales through third parties. Both avenues involved the
secret payment of ten percent kickbacks to Iraqi government-controlled accounts in a manner
designed to avoid detection by UN, inspectors. The payments were characterized as âafter sales
service feesâ (âASSFsâ); however, no services were actually performed. The fee was effectively
a kickback paid te the Traqi regime. Daimlerâs accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed

properly to record the nature of the kickback payments that the company either authorized or

18
made. âThe ASSF payments were not identified in the official purchase contracts provided for the
U.N.âs review and were not made through the U.N.âs authorized payment channels. Daimlerâs
| profits on these Oil for Food Program contracts totaled $4,121,3 3.

88. The ULN. Secutity Council established the Oil for Food Program to address a
humanitarian crisis in Iraq that resulted from trade sanctions levied on Irag by the U.N. and the
US. following Iraqâs invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Under the Program, the then Iraqi government
was permitted to sell crude oil, the proceeds of which flowed into a U.N.-controlled escrow |
account, and the lraqi regime was permitted to use the proceeds to purchase humanitarian
supplies. The kickbacks paid in connection with the Oil for Food contracts had the effect of

diverting funds out of the escrow account and into accounts under the control of the Iraqi
government. The Company knew that the ASSF payments were prohibited by the Oil for Food
Program and by the relevant trade sanctions.

89. Between April and October 2001, Dairaler entered into seven direct contracts with

Iraqi ministries. In all seven transactions, Daimler officials in the Iraq sales office of Overseas
_ Sales entered into side agreements with the Iraqi ministries in order to obtain the U.N. contracts.
Daimler did not disclose to the U.N. the side agreements, which called for illegal kickback
payments totaling approximately $1 million. Of the seven contracts, only one resulted in the
. delivery of a vehicle to Irag before the U.S. invaded Irag in March 2003. This transaction
involved the payment ofa $7,134 kickback to an iraqi government ministry. |

90. Daimler officials took affirmative steps to conceal the nature of the ASSF

_ kickbacks. Following the US. invasion, for example, the U.N. demanded that Daimler
eliminate the ASSF kickbacks from an Oil for Food contract to supply mobile workstations, A

Daimler official falsely represented to the U.N. that the ASSF was âa special discountâ and that

19
-it was nevÃ©r Daimler's âintention to pay such amount to any third party.â The Daimler official
knew that the ASSF payment was not a discount on the contract price, and was instead an
âunder-the-tableâ kickback to be paid at the direction of Iraqi government officials.

91. On another contract, Overseas Sales employees concealed the illegal ASSF

kickback by evading the established UN. payment channels. They disguised the kickback as a
legitimate commission to Daimlerâs agent in Iraq whose company provided warranty service on

. Daimler vehicles in Iraq. Daimler inflated the agentâs commission by $7,1 34, and the agent

wired that amount from his companyâs Swiss bank account to the Iraqi government-controlled

account at the Housing Bank for Trade and Finance in Amman, Jordan. Daimler improperly
recorded the payment as a legitimate agent commission.

92. Ultimately, Daimler conducted most of its Iraqi business under the Program
through third parties. Under the third-party agreements, Daimler sold trucks, truck chassis, and
spare parts to companies in the Middle East and other countries. Daimlerâs contract partners
typically modified the vehicles and resold them to Iraqi ministries, paying the standard 10%
kickback. In total, Daimler entered into twelve third-party contracts in which its contract
partners made an estimated $5 million in ASSF payments.

93. The Daimler officials who negotiated the third-party contracts knew or should
have known that Daimlerâs contract partners would pay illegal kickbacks to iraqi ministries. For
example, Daimler obtained copies of contract files containing resale agreements between its
contract partners and the Iraqi ministry end-purchasers. The contract files included the secret

| side agreements to pay ASSF kickbacks. One internal Daimler email message acknowledged the

side letters using the German abbreviation K.D. for âKundendienst,â or after-sales services

payment.

20
B Daimler Bribed Through Phony Intermediaries and Consultants

94. Daimler routinely used sham intermediaries and consultants to funnel payments to
government officials in several countries, including Russia, Latvia, China, Uzbekistan, Greece,
Turkey, Hungary, Ghana, Nigeria, and Vietnam. Several of these comupt payments were made
to US. bank accounts controlled âby nominees for the foreign government officials.

95. In China, Daimler funneled bribes to government officials through as many as 7 i
âintermediariesâ many of whom were associated with phony consulting contracts or entities.
with no actual business operations.

96. In connection with contracts worth â¬37,415,070 to sell 302 buses and 4 vans to an |
Uzbekistan government agency; for example, Daimlerâs EvoBus subsidiary paid a total of
approximately â¬3.5 million in improper payments to shell companies of government officials to
obtain the deal. |

97.  Daimlerâs internal price calculation sheets marked âconfidentialâ reflect that
BvoBus sales executives promised to pay certain Uzbek government officials 10% of the
underlying net sales price of the bus deal, or approximately â¬3.5 million.

98. Daimler entered into phony consulting agreements with these shell companies .
about one month before exeeuting the sales contract with the Uzbek government agency, while

internally referring to the payments in conniection with the agreements as âNAP | |

99, The payments were sent to a bank account in England and another in Switzerland
held by two nominee companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

100. Similarly, in order to obtain contracts to sell } 17 buses to a city in Latvia in deals
worth approximately â¬30 million, the former head of sales for MB Buses at EvoBus executed -

consulting agreements involving no discernible services with two U.S.-incorporated nominees

24
for City Council members, and paid those entities â¬1,251,274 in connection with the bus
contract.

101. The arrangement to pay the Council members âunder the table moneyâ through
nominees was reflected in several internal EvoBus documents. A March 24, 2002 memo reflects
that a 5% commission on the underlying deal (or â¬216,115) would be made through one of the
US. incorporated nominees to the members of a political party in the Latvian city, who
controlled the City Council at the time, including the son of a high-ranking government official
whose father had influence over the tender, |

102. Other internal documents show that later corrupt payments to members of a
political party on the Latvian City Council, who also had influence over the tender, were made
through the other of the two US. nominees.

103. Daimler routinely made payments to foreign government officials through
nominee and personal bank accounts in Latvia, the United States and other countries with no
other association to the sales transactions at issue, |

104. For example, in order to obtain a contract for the sale of four vehicles to a Russian
government agency, Daimler wired â¬110,000 to a German bank account held in the name of a |
senior official at that government agency.

105.. / Tn addition, Daimler wired funds to bank accounts in Latvia held by five corporate
nominees of the senior official from the Russian government agency, his wife and other
individuals close to him.

106. After the Commissionâs FCPA investigation started, in order to circumvent new
controls that had been put in place, Daimler paid âcommissionsâ totaling â¬488,320 to a third-

party intermediary named by the senior official from the Russian government agency. The third-â

22
party intermediary instructed Daimler to wire the so-called commission payments to Latvian
bank accounts, one of which was previously held in the name of an earlier nominee of the senior
official from the Russian government agency,

E. Daimler Made Bribes Through Dealers and Distributors

107. In countries such as Greece, Liberia, Turkmenistan, Latvia, and Bulgaria, Daimler
utilized certain of its in-country dealers and distributors as corrupt intermediaries to facilitate
deals with government customers, pass bribes to government officials and assist Daimler in
hiding the true nature of the corrupt payments on its books.

108. In Greece, for instance, Daimlerâs long-time Mercedes general representative
owned part of a principally-state-owned company that supplied vehicles to a Greek government
agency. Daimler engaged the Greek representative to use his influence to secure the sale of 645
vehicles to the Greek government agency and coordinated with the representative to pass bribe
payments to government officials through phony consultants and intermediaries.

109. In connection with this deal, Daimler paid nearly DM 17 million, which was
shared between officials of the Greek government agency and the Greek representative.

110. Similarly, in order to enter the market and secure business in Tarkmenistan,
Daimler, with the aid of its distributor in Turkmenistan, provided pitts personally to a senior
government official of Turkmenistan, who had decision-making authority over Daimilerâs sales
contracts with the Turkmen government.

lil. . These pifts took the form of two armored vehicles worth at least â¬550,000 in total
and the German translation and publication of a book authored by the Turkmen senior |

government official. There were also at least $2 million in payments to the distributor and other

23
third parties that were characterized in Daimler documents as NLA. payments and additional
costs.

Â¥F. ~~ Daimler Provided Government Officials Lavish Travel

112. In connection with Daimlerâs commercial vehicle business in China, Daimler
routinely executed side agreements with its government customers through which the Company
agreed to retum a certain percentage of the contract or a specific amount of money to the
customer-ââmistabeled as a special commission or special discountâfor the purpose of funding.
lavish trips for government officials. |

113. The âdelegation tripsâ funded by the so-called discounts and commissions were in
reality lavish vacations to European cities for Chinese government officials and their relatives.

114. . in order to sell two commercial vehicles to a Chinese government agency, for
| example, Daimler executed side agreements stating that â¬11,000 as a âspecial commissionâ
would be returned to the customer once full payment was received on the commercial vehicles

and that Daimler would pay for accommodations and flights for a six person delegation to visit
âGermany/Europe.â

115. As reflected in internal documents, Daimler later allocated â¬1 1,000 towards
financing a lavish vacation for six officials io Luxembourg, Amsterdam, Brussels, Patis, Rome,
- Florence, Venice and Munich. In total; between 1999 and 2006, Daimler paid for at least 16
such delegation trips in connection with $120 million in vehicle sales to the Chinese government
customers,

SEC Charges Daimler AG With Global Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-51

Washington, D.C., April 1, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced a settlement with Daimler AG for violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), alleging that the Stuttgart, Germany-based
automobile manufacturer engaged in a repeated and systematic practice of
paying bribes to foreign government officials to secure business in Asia,
Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

 

Additional Materials
Â» SEC Complaint

 

Daimler agreed to pay $91.4 million in disgorgement to settle the SEC's
charges and pay $93.6 million in fines to settle charges in separate criminal
proceedings announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The SEC alleges that Daimler paid at least $56 million in improper payments
over a period of more than 10 years. The payments involved more than 200
transactions in at least 22 countries. Daimler earned $1.9 billion in revenue
and at least $90 million in illegal profits through these tainted sales
transactions, which involved at least 6,300 commercial vehicles and 500
passenger cars. Daimler also paid kickbacks to Iragi ministries in connection
with direct and indirect sales of motor vehicles and spare parts under the
United Nations Oil for Food Program.

""It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a
standard business practice,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's
Division of Enforcement. ""The financial and reputational costs incurred by
Daimler as a result are a lesson that should be studied closely by all
companies.""

Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit,
added, ""The bribery was so pervasive in Daimler's decentralized corporate
structure that it extended outside of the sales organization to internal audit,
legal, and finance departments. These departments should have caught and
stopped the illegal sales practices, but instead they permitted or were directly
involved in the company's bribery practices.""

The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia,
alleges that Daimler used bribes to further government sales in such
countries as Russia, China, Vietnam, Nigeria, Hungary, Latvia, Croatia, and
Bosnia. Among other means, Daimler used dozens of ledger accounts, known
internally as ""interne Fremdkonten"" or ""internal third party accounts"" to
maintain credit balances for the benefit of government officials. These credit
balances were controlled by Daimler subsidiaries or outside third parties,
including foreign government officials or Daimler's dealers, distributors or
other agents who were at times used as intermediaries to make payments to
foreign government officials. The accounts were funded through several
bogus pricing mechanisms, such as ""price surcharges,"" ""price inclusions,"" or
excessive commissions. Daimler also used artificial discounts or rebates on
sales contracts to effectuate bribes. In those instances, all or a portion of the
discount was kicked back through a ledger account to a foreign government
official, rather than credited to the purchasing government customer.

The SEC alleges that bribes also were made through phony sales
intermediaries and corrupt business partners, as well as through the use of
cash desks. Sales executives would obtain cash from the company in amounts
as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars, enabling Daimler to obscure the
purpose and recipients of the money paid to government officials.

According to the SEC's complaint, the bribery permeated several major
business units and subsidiaries, was sanctioned by members of Daimler's
management, and continued during the course of the SEC's investigation.
Daimler's corrupt practices were authorized by or known to the former heads
of Daimler's Overseas Sales and Commercial Vehicles departments, the
former head of Daimler Export and Trade Finance (a subsidiary of Daimler
Financial Services), and the former heads of Daimler subsidiaries in numerous
foreign countries.

Daimler violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by
making illicit payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or
retain business. Daimler violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by
failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the
payments, and it violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by
improperly recording the payments in its books and records.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Daimler has consented to
the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of
Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The court
order also requires Daimler to comply with certain undertakings regarding its
FCPA compliance program, including a provision that requires the company to
retain an independent consultant for three years. Daimler cooperated with the
ongoing investigation, conducted its own substantial internal investigation,
and remediated problems as they were identified.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice's
Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Tenaris to Pay $5.4 Million in SEC's First-Ever Deferred
Prosecution Agreement

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-112

Washington, D.C., May 17, 2011 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with Tenaris S.A.
in its first-ever use of the approach to facilitate and reward cooperation in SEC
investigations.

 

Additional Materials

Â®Â» Deferred Prosecution Agreement

 

The agreement with Tenaris involves allegations that the global manufacturer
of steel pipe products violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by
bribing Uzbekistan government officials during a bidding process to supply
pipelines for transporting oil and natural gas. The SEC alleges that Tenaris
made almost $5 million in profits when it was subsequently awarded several
contracts by the Uzbekistan government. Under the terms of the DPA, Tenaris
must pay $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.

Tenaris is the first company to enter into a DPA with the SEC, an approach
announced last year to encourage individuals and companies to provide
information about misconduct and assist with an SEC investigation. When
Tenaris conducted a thorough, worldwide internal review of its operations and
controls, it discovered FCPA violations by personnel in Uzbekistan and
informed the SEC. In response to its findings, Tenaris reviewed its controls
and compliance measures and significantly enhanced its anti-corruption
policies and practices. Tenaris has agreed to cooperate further with the SEC,
Justice Department, and any other law enforcement agency in connection
with this case. Tenaris also agreed to pay a $3.5 million criminal penalty in a
Non-Prosecution Agreement announced today by the Justice Department.

âThe Tenaris foreign bribery scheme was unacceptable and unlawful, but the
companyâs response demonstrated high levels of corporate accountability and
cooperation,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of
Enforcement. âThe companyâs immediate self-reporting, thorough internal
investigation, full cooperation with SEC staff, enhanced anti-corruption
procedures, and enhanced training made it an appropriate candidate for the
Enforcement Divisionâs first Deferred Prosecution Agreement. Effective
enforcement of the securities laws includes acknowledging and providing
credit to those who fully and completely support our investigations and who
display an exemplary commitment to compliance, cooperation, and
remediation.â

Cheryl Scarboro, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit, added,
âTenarisâs conduct was Clearly in violation of the FCPA. The companyâs
employees bribed government officials in Uzbekistan to obtain government
contracts. But when Tenaris discovered the illegal conduct, it took noteworthy
steps to address the violations and significantly enhance its anti-corruption
policies and practices to remediate weaknesses in its internal controls.â

Tenaris is incorporated in Luxembourg and its American Depositary Receipts
(TS) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. According to the DPA, the
SEC alleges that Tenaris bid on a series of contracts in 2006 and 2007 and
bribed Uzbekistan officials to gain access to confidential bids by competitors.
Tenaris used the information to revise its own bids, and as a result was
awarded several contracts by the Uzbekistan government.

Under the terms of the DPA, the SEC will refrain from prosecuting the
company in a civil action for its violations if Tenaris complies with certain
undertakings. Among other things, Tenaris has agreed to enhance its policies,
procedures, and controls to strengthen compliance with the FCPA and anti-
corruption practices. Tenaris will implement due diligence requirements
related to the retention and payment of agents, provide detailed training on
the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, require certification of compliance
with anti-corruption policies, and notify the SEC of any complaints, charges, or
convictions against Tenaris or its employees related to violations of any anti-
bribery or securities laws. Tenaris has agreed to continue to fully cooperate
with the SEC in its investigation.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Karen L. Martinez, Assistant
Director of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and William B. McKean of the
Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of
the Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in this case. The SECâs investigation is continuing.

ARMOR HOLDINGS, INC., )

Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the

âCommissionâ), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from violations by Defendant Armor Holdings, Inc.
(âArmor Holdingsâ) of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âF CPAâ), as codified in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ).

2. From 2001 through 2006, certain agents of Armor Holdings participated in
a bribery scheme in which corrupt payments were authorized to be made to an official of
the United Nations (âU.N.â), for the purpose of obtaining and retaining U.N. business.

3. Armor Holdings generated more than $7.1 million in improper revenues,
and realized over $1.5 million in improper profits, through the award of U.N. body armor
contracts to its subsidiary during this period.

4. From 2001 through June 2007, another Armor Holdings subsidiary

employed an accounting practice that disguised in its books and records approximately

ââ= -~
a ay

$4,371,278 in commissions paid to intermediaries who brokered the sale of goods to
foreign governments.

5. By virtue of this conduct, Armor Holdings violated the anti-bribery, books
and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA and the Exchange Act.
JURISDICTION

6. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),
21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 7Baal. Defendant,
directly or indirectly, made use of the mails and/or the means and instrumentalities of
interstate commerce in connection with the conduct described in this Complaint.

7. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because Armor Holdings, as a U.S. issuer, filed required periodic
reports with the Commission in this judicial district.

DEFENDANT

8. Armor Holdings, Inc., during the relevant period, was a Delaware
corporation, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, whose operating subsidiaries
specialized in the manufacture and sale of military, law enforcement, and personnel
safety equipment. During the relevant period, the companyâs common stock was
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and listed
on the New York Stock Exchange. On July 31, 2007, after the conduct described in this
Complaint had already occurred, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems, Inc. â

an indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of Britainâs BAE Systems PLC. Accordingly,

Armor Holdings is no longer registered as an issuer of securities.
âa

RELEVANT ENTITIES

9. Armor Holdings Products, LLC (âAHPâ), during the relevant period,
was a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. AHP, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Armor Holdings, was listed in public filings as one of three
reportable business divisions in which Armor Holdings was organized.

10. Armor Products International, Ltd. (âAPIâ), during the relevant period,
was a wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary of AHP. APIâs financial results were consolidated
into AHPâs financial statements which, in turn, were consolidated within the financial
statements of Armor Holdings.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
U.N. Bribery Scheme

11. Beginning in at least 2001, an AHP vice president and an API senior
officer, agents of Armor Holdings, participated in a scheme to help API obtain contracts
for the supply of body armor to be used in U.N. peacekeeping missions.

12. | These agents of Armor Holdings caused API to enter into a sham
consulting agreement with a third-party intermediary for purportedly legitimate services
in connection with the sale of goods to the U.N. API agreed to pay the intermediary a
success fee in the form of a percentage of value of any contract obtained from the U.N.

13. Between 2001 and 2006, API received various invoices from the third-
party intermediary. The intermediary charged API inflated or illegitimate commissions
for its purported consulting services â reaching as high as twenty percent of the amount

to be earned on the original contract.
âap

14, Agents of Armor Holdings knew or consciously disregarded that some
portion of these commissions would be offered to a U.N. official. In September 2001, the
third-party intermediary instructed API to provide a signed, but otherwise blank, pricing
sheet that the intermediary would complete after learning from a U.N. procurement
official about non-public bids submitted by competitors for the contract.

15.  Inlate September 2001, the third-party intermediary obtained a
confidential internal U.N. memorandum recommending that API be awarded the contract.
The intermediary immediately emailed this internal U.N. document to an agent of Armor
Holdings â advising him to âPLEASE DESTROY AFTER READING.â

16. In October 2001, the U.N. awarded API a multi-year contract for the
supply of body armor. APIâs ability to secure this business was facilitated by the
intermediaryâs inside access within the U.N. procurement system. |

17. In February 2003, an AHP vice president asked the third-party
intermediary how API could win a renewal contract to sell body armor to the U.N. The
intermediary responded that the same rules would apply to the 2003 tender as applied to
the 2001 tender. In August 2003, API received another three-year contract from the UN.

18. In 2006, API received an additional one-year supply extension from the
U.N., without further assistance from the third-party intermediary. Such an extension
was contemplated by the 2003 contract.

19. By late 2006, API had made at least ninety-two payments to the U.N.
intermediary, totaling approximately $222,750. Agents of Armor Holdings caused API
to wire payments to the intermediary with the understanding that part of these payments

would be offered to a U.N. official who could help steer business to API.
ma

20. From the 2001 and 2003 UN. body armor contracts â together with the
one-year extension granted in 2006 â Armor Holdings derived gross revenues of
approximately $7,121,237, and net profits of approximately $1,552,306.

âDistributor Netâ Accounting Disguised Sales Commissions

21. From in or around 2001 through June 2007, AHP also employed a
separate accounting practice â hereinafter described as âdistributor netâ â that disguised
in the books and records of Armor Holdings roughly $4,371,278 in commissions paid to
third-party intermediaries who brokered the sale of goods to foreign governments.

22. Since the sales intermediaries never obtained title over the goods, and
AHP retained the risks and rewards of ownership prior to delivery, U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (âGAAPâ) required AHP to record sales to foreign
governments at the full or âgrossâ sales price â with a separate display of any
commission expense for amounts paid to an intermediary. Instead, however, AHP
adopted the âdistributor netâ accounting practice which disguised certain commission
payments to sales intermediaries in the books and records of Armor Holdings.

23. Ina typical âdistributor netâ transaction, AHP sent the foreign-government ,
customer a âgrossâ invoice â including the sales price of goods sold, plus commission â
while internally recording sales at a ânetâ amount that did not include the commission
due to the third-party sales intermediary. Thus, amounts received from the customer
would be greater than the amount booked internally forâa sale, resulting in a credit
balance in the customerâs account receivable.

24. AHP would then transfer the âoverpaymentâ through a series of non-

commission accounts before ultimately disbursing it to the third-party sales intermediary.
ae yg

These payments to sales intermediaries under âdistributor netâ accounting were never
recorded as a commission expense on the books and records of Armor Holdings.

25. The largest âdistributor netâ deal involved a sale of body armor vests to |
the Iraqi government. In this 2005 transaction, an Armor Holdings subsidiary submitted
âgrossâ invoices totaling $3,364,532 through an intermediary in the U.K. Rather than
record the transaction at the âsrossâ amount, AHP booked the sales and accounts ~
receivable at the ânetâ amount of $2,220,000. AHP then recorded much of the
$1,144,532 âoverpaymentâ in unrelated accounts before disbursing commissions to two
sales intermediaries. The effect of âdistributor netâ accounting for this transaction was to
conceal over $1 million in commissions on the books and records of Armor Holdings.

26. | Armor Holdings was on notice that AHPâs âdistributor netâ accounting
was improper. For example, on March 12, 2001, Armor Holdingsâ outside auditor
emailed comments to certain senior officers, indicating that the âdistributor netâ practice
understated accrued liabilities and accounts receivable, and that the company should
record a receivable for the gross amount due, together with an accrual for commissions.

27. Subsequently, on September 22, 2005, the comptroller of another Armor
Holdings subsidiary who had refused to implement âdistributor netâ at his division
advised senior officials at AHP and Armor Holdings of his concern that such accounting
was âblown out of the waterâ by GAAP. Because AHP acted as a manufacturer rather
than a distributor, the comptroller believed âit would be wholly inappropriate, based on
the guidance in EITF [Emerging Issues Task Force] 99-19 to record the revenues net.â

28. Despite these admonitions, AHP continued to employ âdistributor netâ

accounting through June 2007.
a yg

29. AHP used âdistributor netâ accounting in at least 92 transactions from
2001 through June 2007 â resulting in approximately $4,371,278 of undisclosed
commissions on the books and records of Armor Holdings, and rendering those books

and records inaccurate.

SEC Charges Armor Holdings, Inc. With FCPA Violations
in Connection With Sales to the United Nations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-146

Washington, D.C., July 13, 2011 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Armor Holdings, Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) by participating in a bribery scheme from 2001 through 2006 to obtain
contracts to supply body armor for use in United Nations (U.N.) peacekeeping
missions. The SEC also charged Armor Holdings, a Florida-based manufacturer
of military and law enforcement safety equipment, with failing to properly
account for more than $4 million in commissions from 2001 through 2007 in
violation of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
federal securities laws.

 

Additional Materials

Â®Â» SEC Complaint
Â® Litigation Release No. 22037

 

Armor Holdings agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying nearly $5.7
million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties. Armor Holdings
also agreed to pay a $10.29 million fine to settle a parallel criminal
investigation announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today. Since 2010,
the SEC has filed 32 FCPA cases, including the case against Armor Holdings,
and obtained more than $600 million in penalties, disgorgement and interest.

âIllicit payments to U.N. officials are no less reprehensible than bribes to
foreign government officials,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs
Division of Enforcement. âThe important process of selecting body armor for
peace keepers should not be affected by which company pays the best
bribes.â

Gerald W. Hodgkins, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement,
added, âArmor failed to maintain adequate internal controls to prevent its
subsidiary from making illegal payments to win U.N. supply contracts. Just as
troubling, Armor improperly accounted for sales commissions for several
years even after being warned that the accounting treatment was wrong.â

The SECâs complaint alleges that certain agents of Armor Holdings caused its
U.K. subsidiary to wire at least 92 payments, totaling approximately $222,750
to a third-party intermediary, with the understanding that part of these
payments would be offered to a U.N. official who could help steer business to
Armor Holdingsâ U.K. subsidiary. The complaint alleges that agents of Armor
Holdings caused its U.K. subsidiary to enter into a sham consulting agreement
with the intermediary for purportedly providing legitimate services in
connection with the sale of goods to the U.N. The complaint alleges that,
through this bribery scheme, Armor Holdings derived gross revenues of
$7,121,237, and net profits of $1,552,306.

The SEC alleges that another Armor Holdings subsidiary disguised in its books
and records commissions paid to intermediaries who brokered the sale of
goods to foreign governments. Even after being warned by internal and
external accountants that this practice violated U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, Armor Holdingsâ subsidiary continued the improper
accounting practice. As a result, approximately $4 million in commissions was
not properly disclosed in the books and records of the company.

On July 31, 2007, after the conduct alleged in the SECâs complaint had
occurred, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems, Inc., an indirect
wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Britainâs BAE Systems PLC. Accordingly,
Armor Holdings is no longer an issuer of securities.

The SECâs complaint charges Armor Holdings with violating Sections 30A,
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without
admitting or denying the allegations, Armor Holdings consented to the entry
of a permanent injunction against further violations and agreed to pay
$1,552,306 in disgorgement, $458,438 in prejudgment interest, and a civil
money penalty of $3,680,000. Armor Holdings also agreed to comply with
certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. The settlement
is subject to court approval. Armor Holdings conducted a thorough
investigation to determine the scope of the improper payments and
cooperated with the SECâs inquiry.

Richard J. Kutchey and Gregory G. Faragasso conducted the SECâs
investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud
Section of DOJâs Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
SECâs investigation is continuing.

SEC Charges Liquor Giant Diageo with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-158

Washington, D.C., July 27, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged one of the worldâs largest producers of premium alcoholic
beverages with widespread violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) stemming from more than six years of improper payments to
government officials in India, Thailand, and South Korea.

 

Additional Materials
Â» Administrative Proceeding Release No. 34-64978

 

The SEC found that London-based Diageo plc paid more than $2.7 million
through its subsidiaries to obtain lucrative sales and tax benefits relating to
its Johnnie Walker and Windsor Scotch whiskeys, among other brands. Diageo
agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle the SECâs charges. The
company also agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the FCPAâs
books and records and internal controls provisions.

âFor years, Diageoâs subsidiaries made hundreds of illicit payments to foreign
government officials,â said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SECâs
Division of Enforcement. âAs a result of Diageoâs lax oversight and deficient
controls, the subsidiaries routinely used third parties, inflated invoices, and
other deceptive devices to disguise the true nature of the payments.â

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings
against Diageo, the company made more than $1.7 million in illicit payments
to hundreds of government officials in India from 2003 to mid-2009. The
officials were responsible for purchasing or authorizing the sale of its
beverages in India, and increased sales from these payments yielded more
than $11 million in profit for the company.

The SEC found that from 2004 to mid-2008, Diageo paid approximately
$12,000 per month - totaling nearly $600,000 - to retain the consulting
services of a Thai government and political party official. This official lobbied
other high-ranking Thai government officials extensively on Diageoâs behalf in
connection with pending multi-million dollar tax and customs disputes,
contributing to Diageoâs receipt of certain favorable decisions by the Thai
government.

According to the SECâs order, Diageo paid 100 million in Korean currency
(more than $86,000 in U.S. dollars) to a customs official in South Korea as a
reward for his role in the governmentâs decision to grant Diageo significant
tax rebates. Diageo also improperly paid travel and entertainment expenses
for South Korean customs and other government officials involved in these
tax negotiations. Separately, Diageo routinely made hundreds of gift
payments to South Korean military officials in order to obtain and retain liquor
business.

The SECâs order found that Diageo and its subsidiaries failed properly to
account for these illicit payments in their books and records. Instead, they
concealed the payments to government officials by recording them as
legitimate expenses for third-party vendors or private customers, or
categorizing them in false or overly vague terms or, in some instances, failing
to record them at all. Diageo lacked sufficient internal controls to detect and
prevent the wrongful payments and improper accounting.

The SECâs order found that Diageo violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)
(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the
findings, Diageo agreed to cease and desist from further violations and pay
$11,306,081 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $2,067,739, anda
financial penalty of $3 million. Diageo cooperated with the SECâs investigation
and implemented certain remedial measures, including the termination of
employees involved in the misconduct and significant enhancements to its
FCPA compliance program.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Marilyn Ampolsk and Scott
Weisman.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from widespread bribery of foreign officials by
Innospec, Inc., some of which occurred and was approved by Paul W. Jennings
(âJenningsâ) beginning in mid to late 2004 during his tenure as Chief Financial Officer
(âCFOâ) and continuing after he became Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) in 2005.
From 2000 to 2008, Innospec, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and
| . other specialty chesitienis. routinely paid bribes to government officials in order ts sell |
TEL, a fuel additive, which boosts the octane value of gasoline: to saventimedit owned
refineries and oil companies in Iraq and Indonesia. TEL is a sunset product because â
worldwide use of TEL has declined since 1973 following the enactment of the U.S. Clean

Air Act of 1970 and similar legislation in other countries. Innospec engaged in bribery to
maintain its TEL business, which accounted for significant revenue during the relevant
time period.

2 Innospecâs known bribery activities in Iraq began with its participation in
the United Nations (âUNâ) Oil for Food Program in 2001, and extended all the way until
at least 2008. Innospec also paid bribes to government officials in Indonesia beginning
as early as 2000, and continued until 2005, when Indonesiaâs need for TEL ended.
Innospecâs internal controls failed to detect the illicit conduct, which continued for nearly
adecade. Beginning in mid to late 2004, Jennings, who held various senior roles at
Innospec, including CFO.and CEO, actively participated in the bribery schemes in Iraq
and Indonesia.

3. In all, between 2000 and 2008, Innospec made illicit payments of
approximately $6,347,588 and promised an additional $2,870,377 in illicit payments to
Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian government officials in
exchange for contracts worth approximately $176,717,341 in revenues and profits of
$60,071,613.

4. Jennings violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) by engaging in widespread bribery of government officials in Iraq
during the post-Oil for Food period in order to sell TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil
(âMoOâ) and by engaging in bribery of Indonesian officials to-sell TEL to state owned
oil companies in Indonesia. Jennings aided and abetted Innospecâs violations of Section
30A by substantially assisting in Innospecâs bribery of Iraqi and Indonesian government

officials.
5. Innospec, a U.S. issuer, made use of U.S. mails and interstate commerce to
carry out the scheme, and Jennings, a dual U.S. and U.K. national was complicit in the
scheme. Jennings both sent and received e-mails to and from the United States to
carryout the scheme. He also used interstate commerce and the mails as part of the
scheme. Jennings obtained $116,092 in bonuses that were tied to the success of the TEL
sales, which were procured through bribery.

6. Jennings also violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule
13b2-1 thereunder by falsifying documents as part of the bribery scheme. Jennings also
violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 by making false statements to accountants and
violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing false personal certifications required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were attached to annual and quarterly Innospec
public filings.

7. Jennings also aided and abetted Innospecâs violations of Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by substantially assisting in Innospecâs
failure to maintain internal controls to detect and prevent bribery of officials in Iraq and

âIndonesia, and the improper recording of the illicit payments in Innospecâs books and
records.
JURISDICTION

8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27 of the Exchange.Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. Innospec, Jennings,
and others directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection

with the transactions, acts, practices, and-courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
9. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act

[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

FACTS

L BRIBERY OF IRAQI OFFICIALS IN CONNECTION WITH TEL SALES

29.  Innospecâs bribery in Iraq began as early as 2000 when Innospec paid

kickbacks to Iraq in order to secure five contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food
Program.â Jennings was not involved in the Oi for Food kickback scheme. Jennings
joined Innospec as the Chief Financial Officer in November 2002. Jennings learned of
the longstanding practice of paying bribes to obtain TEL orders in mid to late 2004. in
2004, Jennings assumed the role of head of the TEL unit in addition to his role as CFO.
Executive B, the former Chief Executive Officer of Innospec, informed Jennings that
Innospec paid kickbacks during the Oil for Food Program and that Innospec was engaged â
in ongoing bribery to obtain TEL orders. At the time, Jennings reported to Executive B.
After Executive Bâs departure in 2005, Jennings became the interim CEO replacing
Executive B and became the permanent CEO and President of Innospec in June 2005.
- Beginning in mid to late 2004, Jennings actively participated in authorizing and
approving bribery payments.Â°

| 30. Beginning in 2005, Jennings, along with other members of Innospecâs
management, approved bribery payments to officials at the Iraqi Ministry of Oil (âMoOâ)
in order to sell TEL to Iraq through its Swiss subsidiary, Alcor Chemie Vertriebs GMBH

(âAlcorâ). Innospec used its agent, Naaman, to funnel the payments to Iraqi officials.

 

5 The Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population,
which faced severe hardship under the international trade sanctions that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The Program permitted the Iraqi government to sell its crude oil-and use the Proceeds to piusehgte
food, medicine, and critical infrastructure supplies through a U. N: Escrow Account maintained in New. â
York. Corruption was rampant within the Program. By: mid-2000: Traqi- ministries, âon the instruction of top
government officials, including Saddam Hussein, demanded companies pay aten percent kickback on each
âcontract. This kickback was euphemistically referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee; however, no
services were provided. In all, Innospec paid kickbacks of $1,853,754 and offered additional kickbacks of
$1,985,897 to Iraq, earning revenues of approximately $45,804,915 on the five Oil for Food contracts and
profits of $23,125,820:

6 Although Jennings was not involved in the payment of kickbacks during the Oil for Food
Program, Jennings was aware that ASSF payments had been made and that the companyâs auditors had
raised questions about the ASSF payments. After learning that Innospec had paid bribes in connection with
the Oil for Food Program, Jennings did not inform the auditors of this information. Jennings was also
aware that Iraqi oil officials who originally demanded the kickbacks in the form of ASSFs in 2003
continued demanding that Innospec pay two ASSF payments that were never made due to the invasion of
Iraq by U.S. coalition forces. He was also aware, and did not disclose, that Innospec incorporated the
promised kickbacks into its promt
Innospec made payments totaling approximately $1,610,327 and promised an additional
$884,480 to MoO officials so as to garner good will with Iraqi authorities, obtain
additional orders under a Long Term Purchase Agreement that was executed in October
2004 (the â2004 LTPAâ) and ensure the execution of a second LTPA in January 2008

(the â2008 LTPAâ). Innospecâs total profit received from the conduct was $15,439,183.

A. Bribery of Iraqi Government Officials in Connection with the 2004
LTP.

31. Following the termination of the U.N. Oil for Food Program in late 2003,
Alcor entered into a three year Long Term Purchase Agreement for the sale of TEL to the
Iraqi MoO. The 2004 LTPA was executed in October 2004, and was performed pursuant
to six purchase orders dated February 2005 through December 2007. Under the contract,
Alcor sold a total of 5,932 Metric Tons (âMTâ) of TEL at a price of â¬10,500 per MT.
Innospecâs revenues from the contract were $82,340,489, and profits were $15,198,125.

32. With the approval of Innospecâs management, including Jennings,
Innospec continued to use Naaman, the agent used to make illicit payments under the Oil
for Food Program, to make improper payments to Iraqi officials to facilitate TEL
shipments under the 2004 LTPA. On October 10, 2005, Naaman sent an e-mail to

. Turner, copying Jennings, stating that prior to opening a letter of credit for a 740.MT

shipment of TEL, Iraqi officials were demanding a2% kickback from Alcor, which
equaled $195,912.78. Naamanâs e-mail to management further stated that: âWe are
sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we

will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get

the rewards.â
33. With Jenningsâ knowledge, Turner responded to Naamanâs e-mail.on
October 13, 2005, confirming that the requested kickback would be paid through an
additional 2% âcommissionâ to Naaman. On October 20, 2005, Tumer and Alcor
Manager discussed the wording of the invoice that Naaman would submit to Alcor to
support the kickback, with Tumer stating that âthe fewer words the better!â That same
day, Turner e-mailed Naaman the fictitious language that he wanted Naaman to include
in the invoice that he submitted to Alcor for the $195,912.78 payment. The payment was
approved with Jenningsâ knowledge.

34. In a similar e-mail dated February 5, 2006, Naaman informed Turner that
Iraqi officials were again demanding a 2% kickback in order to open a letter of credit for
an order of 2000 MT (later revised to 2200 MT) of TEL under the 2004 LTPA. In an e-
mail dated February 7, 2006, Jennings, while in the United States, approved the kickback
payment, and on February 10, 2006, Turner wrote Naaman to confirm that Alcor would
pay him an additional 2% âcommissionâ in connection with the order. In approximately
July 2006, Jennings approved an increase in Naamanâs commission on the 2004 LTPA

"" from 3% to 5% with the understanding that some or all of the additional 2% would be
used by Naaman to pay off Iraqi officials on future LTPA orders.

35. ; On behalf of inniaspec and Alcor, Naaman paid an official at the Trade. Â°

Bank of Iraq in exchange for a favorable exchange rate on letters of credit for purchases
under the 2004 LTPA. Jennings was aware of the scheme.

36. âInall, from October 2005 to 2007, Innospec paid approximately
$1,369,269 in bribes to Iraqi officials, a significant portion funneled through Naaman, in

connection with the 2004 LTPA. The false commission invoices submitted by Naaman

10
with the knowledge of Jennings and senior officials at Innospec caused the bribe
payments to be improperly booked as legitimate commission payments on Innospecâs
books and records.

B. Bribery of Iraqi Government Officials to Ensure the Failure of a 2006
Trial Test of MMT and to Facilitate the Execution of a Second LTPA

with Iraq in 2008
37. In addition to the bribes to facilitate TEL orders on the 2004 LTPA,

Turner and others at Innospec directed and approved Naaman to pay a bribe of $155,000
in September 2006 and April 2007 to Iraqi officials, so that Innospec could ensure the
failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured by a competitor of
Innospec and that competed with TEL. Naaman agreed to funnel the bribe payment on
Innospecâs behalf.

38. | Tumer and others at Innospec were concerned that if the MMT test was
successful it would cause Iraq to.purchase substantial amounts of MMT for its oil
refineries and lead to a corresponding decrease in demand for TEL in 2008. Accordingly,
on September 18, 2006, Turner approved a payment of $105,000 to Naaman, purportedly
âfor additional technical support and security operations required to nurture and protect
ongoing TEL business in Iraq.â

39. On February 28, 2007, Naaman sent Turner a letter enclosing the
confidential official MoO report for the MMT field trial test and noting his success in
making sure that the MMT test failed âagainst all odds.â Naaman also enclosed a
$50,000 invoice to Innospec, saying that he had been required to pay an extra $50,000 to
ensure that the MMT report came out in Innospecâs favor. The confidential report was

also shared with Jennings who was generally aware of the bribery of Iraqi officials.

11
40. On April 3, 2007, Innospec reimbursed Naaman for the additional $50,000
payment, which Turner approved. The two payments totaling $155,000 were improperly
booked as legitimate commission payments on Innospecâs books and records. Despite
the agreement between Turner and Naaman, Naaman retained some or all of the
$155,000 for himself.

41. Aside from agreeing to pay $155,000 up front to ensure that the MMT test
failed, Naaman, on Alcorâs behalf and with management authorization, also promised
additional bribes to Iraqi officials in connection with future TEL orders. In an e-mail
dated March 21, 2007, to Turner, Naaman described how he would use his 5%
commission from remaining shipments in 2007 and the new LTPA âto cover my promise
to these people for the loss of their remuneration from MMT, which is a very small price
we are paying versus the loss of my money and your money if MMT were admitted in.â
MMT was not admitted into Iraq. From in or around 2007 through February 2008,
Tumer and Naaman agreed to pay bribes to MoO officials to secure the 2008 LTPA with
Jenningsâ general knowledge that bribes were paid to Iraqi officials to obtain contracts.

42. In January 2008 Alcor executed a second LTPA with the MoO. In or
around late 2007 through early 2008, Naaman negotiated with a senior Iraqi MoO official
to pay bribes under the 2008: LTPA. The agreement took affect in June 2008 and on
February 24, 2009, the MoO opened a letter of credit in favor of Alcor for $17,000,000.
Had the agreement gone forward, 5% of the $17,000,000, i.e. $850,000, would
presumably have been shared with Iraqi officials via Naaman.

43. The agreement; however, did not go forward due to the investigation and

ultimate discovery of the widespread bribery in Iraq by United States regulators.

12
Innospec admitted that negotiations leading up to the agreement were tainted by bribery,
and as a result, the 2008 LTPA was not performed and Innospec did not pay Naaman any
commissions on the contract.

ke. Innospec Engaged in a Scheme to Pay Travel and Entertainment
Expenses for MoO Officials

44. Jennings was also generally aware of a scheme used by Innospec to incur
good will with the MoO and ensure that it continued to receive TEL orders. Turner and
others at Innospec directed and authorized payments, through Naaman, to fund lavish
trips for Iraqi officials in 2005 and 2006. For example, in June 2005, Turner arranged for
Neaman to pay $22,732 to cover the costs of a trip by eight Iraqi officials to Innospecâs
Ellesmere plant in the UK that included hotel accommodations, food and transportation
costs, as well as the provision of approximately $1,800 in âpocket moneyâ for each of
seven officials anid approximately $3,600 for the eighth official, who was head of the
Iraqi delegation. A similar trip with cash payments was taken in March 2006 to Dubai.
One trip in 2006 included a trip taken by a MoO official to Jordan and then Thailand for a
seven day honeymoon in exchange for the MoO officialâs assisting Innospec in a court
proceeding in the U.K. On instructions from Turner, Naaman falsified an invoice for
reimbursement of the cost of the trip to Thailand, to read â âpayment for airfares ee trip to ee
Amman [by the MoO official anid his wife] ie Bietasiaie disoussiowess.  Hinoapee s

payment covered hotel accommodations, food, and transportation costs within Thailand.â .

 

, On January 30, 2008, Naaman submitted an invoice to Alcor and Tumer for approval and
reimbursement of $34,480 for travel costs incurred by Iraqi MoO officials who traveled to Lebanon to
finalize the 2008 LTPA with Alcor. Due to the ongoing investigations being conducted by United States
regulators, Alcor never paid the invoice, which sought reimbursement for hotel accommodations, food,
mobile phone cards, three cameras and $15,000 in âpocket moneyâ for officials.

13
WW. JENNINGS ENGAGED IN BRIBERY OF INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AT STATE OWNED OIL AND GAS COMPANIES

45. Aside from its illicit conduct in Iraq, Innospec also paid bribes to
Indonesian government officials from at least 2000 through 2005 in order to win
contracts for Innospec for the sale of TEL to state owned oil and gas companies in
Indonesia. Jennings became aware of and approved these payments beginning in mid to
late 2004. Innospec used various euphemisms to refer to the bribery scheme, including
âthe Indonesian Way,â âthe Lead Defense Fund,â and âTEL optimization.â The
euphemisms were commonly used in e-mails and in discussions with Jennings, Turner
and others at Innospec who were complicit in the bribery schemes.

46. From 2000 through 2005, the bribes were made through Indonesian Agent
and totaled approximately $2,883,507. Innospecâs revenues in connection with the illicit
bribes were approximately $48,571,937 and profits were $21,506,610. Bribery of
Indonesian officials continued until 2005, when Indonesia converted to unleaded fuel and
no longer needed TEL. Jennings knew about the ongoing bribery in Indonesia from mid

to late 2004.

A. Bribes to an Official at BP Migas in order to Generate
More TEL Sales

47. From 2000 until approximately 2005, Turner and senior officials at
Innospec were involved in a scheme to use Indonesian Agent and his company to pay
bribes of approximately $1,323,507 to Official X, who was the chairman of an
Indonesian state owned oil company called BP Migas. The scheme was outlined in an e-
mail dated January 8, 2001 from Managing Director to Turner stating that in 2000 and

2001 Innospec agreed to pay Official X $40 per MT for all TEL orders in excess of 4000

14
tons and $50 per MT for all TEL orders in excess of 5,000 tons. Jennings became aware
of the payments made to Official X in mid to late 2004 and 2005 in return for TEL
business. Innospec paid bribes of $161,950 to Official X in 2004 and $172,504 in 2005.

B. Bribes to a Government Official at Pertamina in Order to Sell 446.4
Metric Tons of TEL

48. In addition to the payments to Official X and other one-off payments,
Innospec bribed other Indonesian officials in order to influence their decisions regarding
TEL purchases. Prior to Jenningsâ knowledge of the bribery in Indonesia, Innospec was
paying bribes to Official Y at Pertamina. For instance, on December 18, 2003, an
employee of Indonesian Agent e-mailed Turner saying that Indonesian Agent had just
returned from a meeting with Official Y at Pertamina and that Official Y had said he
would help Octel, but he wanted moee-than just âcentsâ in return.

49. On May 14, 2004, the same employee e-mailed Tumer to say that
Indonesian Agent had been working hard to try and stop Indonesian officials from
switching to unleaded fuel in January 2005, and that Indonesian Agent âmight need some
extra money to support the Lead Defense activitiesâ in Indonesia.

50. In an e-mail dated August 16, 2004, to Jennings and Executive B, Turner
said that the entire Board of Pertamina had been replaced and-that âthe old position of
[Official Y was] no more.â âTurner âadded that Official Yâs role would be filled by
Official Z who was well known to Innospec and was being checked. In fall 2004, as head
of the TEL business unit, Jennings traveled to Indonesia with Tuer to meet Indonesian
Agent.

51. | Around November 2004, after Executive B had visited Indonesia,

Executive B met with Jennings to discuss Executive Bâs trip. Executive B told Jennings

15
that bribes had been paid by Innospec for years to get business in Indonesia and Iraq. In
December 2004, Jennings and Executive B discussed Innospecâs bribery scheme in Iraq
and Indonesia on a flight from Denver to New York. Executive B informed Jennings that
âthe bribery was a small cost to them, but was very beneficial; it was a small amount of
money for the government officials, but could have big importance to them. This is the
way it was always doneâ While Indonesian Agent was in the United States during the
holidays, various e-mails were sent to and from the United States that discussed Jenningsâ
and Turnerâs continued efforts to support Indonesian Agentâs payment of bribes on
Innospecâs behalf. Executive B also discussed the bribery scheme during Jenningsâ
performance review in January 2005.

52. In January 2005, Indonesian Agent secured an order on Innospecâs behalf
for 446.4 MT of TEL from Pertamina. In exchange, Innospec, through Turner, agreed to
a âone off paymentâ of $300,000 to Indonesian Agent with the understanding that it
would be passed on to Official Z.

53. The payment was arranged in two parts. First Innospec, with approval by
Jennings, increased Indonesian Agentâs commission on the order from 6% to 10%,
leading to an extra payment of $184,363.20, which was credited to the agentâs account in
Sinpapdre To cover the balance, Turner told Indonesian Agent to submit an invoiee for
$115,636.81 to Innospec, and provided the fictitious language that he wanted included in
the invoice to justify the payment.

54. | On February 8, 2005, Indonesian Agent e-mailed Turner saying that he
had opened an account for Official Z and that Official Z had called requesting his balance

payment. On February 14, 2005, Indonesian Agent submitted the $115,636.81 invoice to

16
Innospec, and Turner and Jennings approved it. On March 18, 2005, Innospec credited
the invoice payment to Indonesian Agentâs account in Singapore. The false invoices and
Turmerâs authorization of them caused Innospec to inaccurately record in its books and
records the entire $300,000 payment to Indonesian Agent as âsales commissions.â

55. In order to ensure that Official Z approved the 446.4 MT order, Turner
directed the payment of a trip taken by Official Z and his family to the UK in April 2005
with Jenningsâ knowledge.* Innospecâs revenues on the sale of 446.4 metric tons of TEL ~
to Pertamina were $4,796,155 and its profits were $1,898,571.

IV. JENNINGS SIGNS FALSE CERTIFICATIONS

56. From 2004 to February 2009, Jennings signed annual certifications that
were provided to auditors where he falsely stated that he complied with Innospecâs Code
of Ethics incorporating the companyâs Foreign Corrupt Practices Act policy, and that he
was unaware of any violations of the Code of Ethics by anyone else. During that time
frame, Jennings actively participated in bribery of Iraqi and Indonesian officials as
described above. Jennings also signed annual and quarterly personal certifications
pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in which Jennings made false certifications
concerning the companyâs books and records and suteonal controls. Jennings also signed
false manasean es certifications to Inhospecâs auditors indicating that the books and

records were accurate and that Innospec had appropriate internal controls.

 

Â§ On January 6, 2005, Turner sent a fax to Indonesian agent with a copy to Jennings indicating that
âAs Paul and I both mentioned during our meeting in Jakarta, we will plan the visit to completely suit the
requirements of our friends from Pertamina.â The âfriendsâ referred to Official Z and another Pertamina
official. The fax further discussed the payment of the travel costs to the U.K. for the officials, and also
indicated that â[w]e will book accommodation at the most prestigious hotel in Chester and we can arrange
golf, shopping or whatever is required .... We look forward to reviewing the commercial details and future
supply arrangements for the year during the visit ....â

SEC Charges Former CEO of Innospec for Role in Bribery
Scheme

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-21

Washington, D.C., Jan. 24, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged a former chief executive officer at Innospec, Inc., with violating
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by approving bribes to government
officials to obtain and retain business.

The SEC alleges that Paul W. Jennings learned of the company's longstanding
practice of paying bribes to win orders for sales of tetraethyl lead (TEL) in
mid- to late 2004 while serving as the CFO. After becoming CEO in 2005,
Jennings and others in Innospec's management approved bribery payments to
officials at the Iraqi Ministry of Oil (MoO) in order to sell the fuel additive to
lraq refineries. Innospec used its third-party agent in Iraq to funnel payments
to Iraqi officials.

 

Additional Materials
Â» SEC Complaint

 

Jennings agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him. The SEC previously
charged Innospec as well as its former TEL business director and its agent in
Iraq with FCPA violations.

""This is the third enforcement action against an individual responsible for the
widespread bribery that occurred at Innospec,"" said Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief
of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. ""We will vigorously hold
accountable those individuals who approve such bribery and who sign false
SOX certifications and other documents to cover up the wrongdoing.""

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, Jennings played a key role in Innospec's bribery activities in Iraq
and Indonesia. Innospec, a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and
other specialty chemicals, was charged last year for making illicit payments of
approximately $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in illicit
payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian
government officials in exchange for contracts worth approximately $176
million.

The SEC alleges that Innospec made payments totaling more than $1.6 million
and promised an additional $884,480 to MoO officials. For example, in an
October 2005 e-mail copying Jennings, the agent said that Iraqi officials were
demanding a 2 percent kickback and that ""[W]e are sharing most of our
profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we will lose
the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to
get the rewards."" The kickback and later payments were paid by increasing
the agent's commission, which Jennings approved. The SEC's complaint also
alleges that Jennings was aware of the scheme to pay an official at the Trade
Bank of Iraq in exchange for a favorable exchange rate on letters of credit.
Another scheme involved a bribe to ensure the failure of a field test of a
competitor product. A confidential MoO report for the field trial test was
shared with Jennings. Bribes were offered to secure a 2008 Long Term
Purchase Agreement that would have caused approximately $850,000 to be
shared with Iraqi officials. The agreement, however, did not go forward due to
the investigation and ultimate discovery by U.S. regulators of widespread
bribery by Innospec.

According to the SEC's complaint, Innospec also paid bribes to Indonesian
government officials from at least 2000 to 2005 in order to win contracts
worth more than $48 million from state-owned oil and gas companies in
Indonesia. Jennings became aware of and approved payments beginning in
mid to late 2004. Various euphemisms to refer to the bribery were commonly
used in e-mails and in discussions with Jennings and others at Innospec,
including ""the Indonesian Way,"" ""the Lead Defense Fund,"" and ""TEL
optimization."" Bribery discussions were held on a flight in the U.S. and even
discussed at Jennings' performance review in 2005. In one bribery scheme
with Pertamina, an Indonesian state owned oil and gas company, Innospec
agreed, with approval by Jennings, to a ""one off payment"" of $300,000 to
their Indonesian Agent with the understanding that it would be passed on to
an Indonesian official.

The SEC's complaint also alleges that from 2004 to February 2009, Jennings
signed annual certifications that were provided to auditors where he falsely
stated that he had complied with Innospec's Code of Ethics incorporating the
Company's FCPA policy. Jennings also signed annual and quarterly personal
certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in which he made
false certifications concerning the company's books and records and internal
controls.

Jennings has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations,
to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating
Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules
13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting
Innospec's violations of Exchange Act Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and13(b)(2)
(B). Jennings will disgorge $116,092 plus prejudgment interest of $12,945,
and pay a penalty of $100,000 that takes into consideration Jennings's
cooperation in this matter.

Tracy L. Price and Denise Hansberry of the SEC Enforcement Division's FCPA
Unit conducted the investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the
U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the U.K.'s SFO in this matter. The SEC's investigation is
continuing.

âCOMPLAINT

11-CV-. si
ECF CASE
Jury Trial Demanded

 

Plaintiff, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ)

alleges:

 

SUMMARY

1. This action involves a bribery scheme that took place over the course of
more than a decade. From approximately 1996 until early 2007, senior executives at
Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (âSiemensâ) and its regional company in Argentina, Siemens
S.A. (âSiemens Argentinaâ), paid scores of millions of dollars in bribes intended for top

government officials in Argentina, including two Presidents and Cabinet Ministers in two

Presidential administrations.

 

 
2. The bribes were initially paid to secure a $1 billion government contract
(the âDNI Contractâ) to produce national identity cards, or Documentos Nacionales de
Identidad, for every Argentine citizen. After paying bribes to obtain it, Siemens was
awarded the DNI Contract in 1998. Later, after a change in Argentine political
administrations resulted in the DNI Contract being suspended, and then canceled,
Siemens paid additional bribes in a failed effort to bring the contract back into force.
Still later, after the company instituted an arbitration proceeding to recover its costs and
expected profits from the canceled DNI Contract, Siemens paid additional bribes to
suppress evidence that it had originally obtained the Contract through corruption.
Excluding evidence of bribery cut off a potential defense to Siemensâ arbitration claim
and ensured that Siemens would finally receive the economic benefit that its bribery

scheme was intended from the start to provide.

3. Over the course of the bribery scheme, Siemens paid an estimated total of
over $100 million in bribes, approximately $31.3 million of which were made after
March 12, 2001, when Siemens became subject to U.S. securities laws. As a result of the
bribes it paid, Siemens in 2007 received an award in arbitration against the government

of Argentina of over $217 million, plus interest.

4, During the relevant 2001-07 time period, defendants Uriel Sharef, Ulrich
Bock, Carlos Sergi, Stephan Signer, Herbert Steffen, Andres Truppel, and Bernd
Regendantz each had a role in authorizing, negotiating, facilitating, or concealing bribe
payments in connection with the DNI Contract. The most senior of these was defendant
Uriel Sharef, who was a member of Siemensâ Managing Board, or Vorstand. Siemens

employed a group of consultants, designated the Project Group and led by defendant
Sergi, to serve as payment intermediaries between the company and the bribed Argentine

government officials.

5. Each of the defendants violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) by engaging in the bribery of government officials in
Argentina. Each defendant also aided and abetted Siemensâ violations of Section 30A.
The defendants violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder by.
falsifying documents, including invoices and sham consulting contracts, in furtherance of
the bribery scheme. Defendant Regendantz violated Rule 13b2-2 by signing false
internal certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act (âSOXâ). All defendants aided
and abetted Siemensâ violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B)
by substantially assisting in Siemensâ failure to maintain internal controls to detect and
prevent bribery of government officials in Argentina, and by substantially assisting in the

improper recordation of the bribe payments in Siemensâ books and records.

JURISDICTION
6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),

and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa].

7. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d). Certain of the acts and transactions

constituting the violations occurred in this District.

8. The defendants directly or indirectly made use of the means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national
securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of

business alleged in this complaint.
DEFENDANTS

9. Uriel Sharef, 2 German citizen, was a Siemens Managing Boardâ Member
from July 2000 to December 2007. During this period, he served as regional âCoachâ for
Siemens Power Generation, Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution, and the
| Americas. From October 2000 to December 2007, Sharef was a member of Siemensâ |
Corporate Executive Committee. Sharef met in New York, NY, with payment:
intermediaries and agreed to pay $27 million in bribes to Argentine officials in |
connection with the DNI Contract. Sharef also enlisted subordinates to conceal the

payments by circumventing Siemensâ internal accounting controls.

10. Ulrich Bock, a German citizen, was from October 1995 through 2001 the
Commercial Head of Major Projects for Siemens Business Services (âSBSâ), the Stemens
operating group responsible for managing the DNI Contract. As the officer responsible
for the DNI Contract, Bock authorized bribe payments to Argentine government officials.
Bock participated in a meeting in Miami, Florida, at which bribes to Argentine officials
were negotiated and promised. Bock also provided false testimony in two arbitration
proceedings, one of which was filed in Washington, D.C., in an effort to conceal

Siemensâ corrupt payments and recover its expected profits from the DNI Contract.

11. Stephan Signer, a German citizen, replaced Bock as Head of Major
_ Projects for SBS in approximately July 2001, and he remained in the position until 2002.
From 2002 through at least 2008, Signer was the Head of Business Operations and

Finance at Siemens IT Solutions and Services, then a business division of Siemens.

 

t In accordance with German law, Siemens has a Supervisory Board and a Management Board. The
Supervisory Board is a rough equivalent to the board of directors of an American company. The Managing
Board, or âVorstand,â fulfills the duties of senior management and includes the companyâs Chief Executive

Officer (âCEOâ) and Chief Financial Officer (âCFOâ).
4
Signer authorized the payment of bribes to government officials in Argentina. Some of

the bribes were paid to bank accounts in the United States.

12. Herbert Steffen, a German citizen, was the CEO of Siemens Argentina
from 1983 through 1989, and again in 1991. He was the Group President of Siemens
Transportation Systems from 1996 to 2003. Because of his longstanding connections in
Argentina and Latin America, Steffen was recruited by Sharef to facilitate the payment of
bribes in connection with the DNI Contract. Steffen met directly with senior government
officials in Argentina and offered bribe payments to them on Siemensâ behalf. Steffen
urged defendant Regendantz to authorize bribe payments that ultimately were made to
bank accounts in the United States. Steffen also participated in one or more telephone
conversations with defendant Sharef, who called him from the United States in

connection with the bribery scheme.

13. Andres Truppel, an Argentine citizen, was the CFO of Siemens
Argentina from 1996 to 2002. Truppel regularly communicated with Argentine
government officials regarding illicit bribe payments. Truppel conveyed Argentine bribe
demands to more senior officials at Siemens and urged them to make the bribe payments,
Truppel participated in meetings in Miami, Florida, and New York, NY, in which bribes
to Argentine officials were negotiated and promised. He caused Siemens to pay, and
promise to pay, millions of dollars in bribes in an effort to retain the DNI Contract. Some

of the bribes were paid via bank accounts in the United States.

14. Carlos Sergi, an Argentine citizen, was a board member of Siemens
Argentina until at least 2002. From the late 1990âs until at least 2004, Sergi held himself

out as a business consultant for Siemens Argentina. In fact, Sergiâs primary role,
continuing to 2007, was to serve as a payment intermediary between Siemens and
Argentine government officials in connection with the DNI Contract. While purporting
to act as a business consultant for Siemens Argentina, Sergi paid bribes to Argentine
government officials on Siemensâ behalf. Some of the bribes were paid via bank

accounts in the United States.

15. Bernd Regendantz, a German citizen, was CFO of Siemens Business
Services (âSBSâ) from February 2002 to 2004. Upon his arrival at SBS in 2002,
Regendantz, who had not earlier been involved in the DNI Contract, was urged by other |
Siemens officials, including defendants Signer and Steffen, to pay bribes that had |
previously been negotiated. Regendantz initially resisted making the payments.
However, when he sought guidance from several top Siemens officials, Regendantz
received consistent instructions that he understood to mean that he should make the
payments. Regendantz then authorized two bribe payments totaling approximately
$10 million on Siemensâ behalf. Some of the amounts were paid into bank accounts in
the United States. With Regendantzâs knowledge and approval, the nature of the
payments was concealed through the use of fictitious invoices, and the payments were
recorded inaccurately in SBSâs and Siemensâ books and records. Regendantz falsely

certified to the accuracy and truthfulness of SBSâs financial statements

RELEVANT ENTITIES
16. Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (âSiemensâ) is a German corporation with
its executive offices in Munich, Germany. Siemens is one of the worldâs largest
manufacturers of industrial and consumer products. It employs approximately 402,000

people and operates in approximately 190 countries worldwide. Siemens reported net
revenue of approximately $100 billion and net income of approximately $8.6 billion for

its fiscal year ended September 30, 2011.

17. Siemens had over 874 million common shares outstanding and a market
capitalization of over $1 20 billion as of June 30, 2011. Since March 12, 2001 Siemensâ
common shares have been registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of
the Exchange Act. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 781(b)]. Siemensâ American Depository Shares, each
representing one common share, trade on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ)

under the symbol âSI.â

18. Prior to a reorganization in 2008, Siemens operated through a complex
array of operating groups and regional companies. The operating groups were divisions
within Siemens and not separate legal entities. âThe regional companies were wholly or
partly-owned subsidiaries. Among the operating groups during the relevant period were
Siemens Business Services and Power Transmission and Distribution. Among the

regional companies was Siemens S.A. (Argentina).

19. | On December 12, 2008, the Commission entered into a settlement with
Siemens in connection with the companyâs bribe payments in Argentina and other
countries. Under that settlement, Siemens consented to an injunction against future
violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and
disgorged wrongful profits of $350 million. At the same time, Siemens paid a criminal
fine of $450 million to settle parallel criminal charges brought by the Department of
Justice. Siemens Argentina entered a guilty plea to violations of Exchange Act Section

30A for its payment of bribes in connection with the DNI Contract: Siemens also paid
criminal fines in Germany to the Munich Public Prosecutor in the amounts of

â¬395 million and â¬201 million.

20. Siemens S.A. (Argentina) (âSiemens Argentinaâ), headquartered in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, was a wholly-owned regional company of Siemens. Beginning
in the late 1990âs, Siemens Argentina worked in conjunction with SBS and other Siemens â
affiliates to secure and retain the DNI Contract. Siemens Argentinaâs financial

statements were consolidated into those of Siemens.

21. Siemens Busines Services GmbH & Co. OHG (âSBSâ), headquartered in
Munich, Germany, was a Siemens operating group that provided consulting, oversight
and management services in connection with the DNI Contract. SBSâs financial

statements were consolidated into those of Siemens.

22. Siemens IT Services S.A. (âSITSâ) was a special purpose entity organized
under Argentine law to bid on and execute the DNI Contract. SITS was wholly-owned
by Siemens-Nixdorf Information System GmbH, a Siemens operating group that later

merged with SBS. SITSâs financial statements were consolidated into those of Siemens.

23. Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution (âSiemens PTDâ)
formerly headquartered in Erlangen, Germany, was a Siemens operating group
responsible for manufacturing large scale power systems. PTD was not directly involved
in the DNI Contract. However, the defendants concealed certain of the DNI Contract
bribe payments and circumvented Siemensâ internal controls by routing the payments

through unrelated PTD contracts.

24. The Project Group, headquartered in Central and South America, was an
informal designation for a collection of entities that served as intermediaries through

8
which Siemens made corrupt payments to Argentine government officials. The Project
Group was led and controlled by Carlos Sergi and included his family members and close
associates as principals. The Project Group was created to coordinate the DNI Contract
bribe payments and to provide a single point of contact for Siemens in negotiating its

bribe payments to Argentine government officials.

FACTS

A. Bribes Paid to Obtain the DNI Contract and to Revive the
Contract after its Suspension by the Argentine Government

25. - In 1994, the Argentine government, headed by then President Carlos
Menem, issued a tender for bids on a contract to replace the countryâs manually-created
national identity booklets with state-of-the-art identity cards. The estimated cost of the
project was $1 billion, Siemens and its Argentine affiliate SITS submitted a bid in
December 1996 and won the project in February 1998. A contract was executed by SITS
with the Argentine Ministry of the Interior the following November. . Throughout this
period, and indeed over the life of the DNI Contract, bribes were sought by and paid to
âArgentine government officials, up to and including the President of Argentina and

Cabinet Ministers.

26. In August 1999, after Argentina became enveloped in a debt crisis,
President Menem suspended the DNI Contract while he campaigned for re-election.
President Menem subsequently lost his re-election bid to. Fernando De la Rua, who just
one month later notified Siemens Argentina that the DNI Contract would be terminated

unless Siemens agreed to renegotiate its terms..

27. In December 2000, Uriel Sharef, a Siemens Managing Board Member, and

Herbert Steffen, then Group President of Siemens Transportation Systems, met

9
personally with new President De la Rua and other senior Argentine government officials â
to discuss the DNI Contract. At the meeting, President De la Rua demanded significant
price concessions to the contract. Siemens agreed to the concessions in return for

President De la Ruaâs promise to issue a national decree mandating the purchase of new

DNI cards for all Argentine citizens, and thus re-authorizing the DNI Contract.

28. As defendants Sharef and Steffen negotiated with President De la Rua,
other Siemens managers, including defendant Bock, met with the intermediaries who had
earlier been involved in paying the bribes on Siemensâ behalf that had enabled Siemens
to obtain the DNI Contract in the first place. The payment intermediaries were
designated the âProject Groupâ and were led by Carlos Sergi, a former Siemens official.
Members of the Project Group advised the Siemens officials that Siemens would have to
pay the remaining unpaid but promised bribes to officials connected with the former
Menem administration, as well as make additional bribe payments to members of the new
- Dela Rua administration, including to President De la Rua himself, in order to have the
DNI Contract reauthorized. Sergi and members of the Project Group told the Siemens
officials that the past and present Argentine officials were demanding a total of
$27 million in corrupt payments to secure the entry of a decree by President De la Rua

reauthorizing the DNI Contract.

29. Bribery was openly discussed at Bockâs meetings with the Project Group,
as documented by Bockâs contemporaneous handwritten notes, as well as internal
memoranda and meeting minutes prepared by Project Group members. Bockâs notes
from a November 22, 2000, meeting with defendant Sergi refer to âtopics.. discussed in

mutual agreementâ with others, including Truppel. The notes list the initials of Argentine

10
officials and the amounts due to each. In total, the notes identify $50.5 million either due
or paid to government officials in connection with the DNI Contract, including

$16 million to former President Menem. A November 26, 2000, memorandum, written
by members of the Project Group, recites that all future bribe payments will be made

through the Project Group and that â[t]he commitment with future third parties is 27 M.â

30. On January 3, 2001, Siemens, via its operating group SBS, signed a $27
million sham consulting agreement with MFast Consulting AG (âMFastâ), an entity
controlled by the Project Group. Bock co-signed the sham contract on behalf of SBS.

The MFast contract did not require MFast to provide any bona fide services. Instead, the |
sole purpose of the contract was to provide a vehicle through which Siemens could funnel

bribe payments to Argentine government officials.

B. Sham Consulting Agreement with a Former Argentine
Minister of Justice

31. In addition to the sham agreement with MFast, Siemens executives found
other ways to exert a corrupt influence on the DNI Contract. In March 2001, the same
month that Siemens became listed on the NYSE, defendant Truppel pressured the
management of SITS to sign a $1 million sham consulting agreement with a company
â owned by a former Argentine Minister of Justice. The former Justice Minister reportedly
had close ties to the head of the Sindicatura General de la Nacion (âSIGENâ), the
national audit board charged with approving the renegotiated DNI contract. SIGENâs
role in Argentina may roughly be compared to that of the General Accountability Office
in the United States. Defendant Truppel told Siemens officials that the former Justice
Minister could influence SIGENâs decision to recommend approval of the revised DNI

Contract.

1]
32. The former Justice Ministerâs firm provided no bona fide services on behalf
of Siemens. Instead, it was paid solely for the purpose of exerting influence on Siemensâ
âbehalf with SIGEN. SITS made an upfront payment of $605,000 to the former Justice

Ministerâs firm on March 20, 2001, and a second payment of $211,750 on July 18, 2001.

C. Cancellation of the DNI Contract

33. Despite the efforts of Siemens and its affiliates to reauthorize the DNI
Contract through the bribery of government officials, the De la Rua administration on
May 18, 2001, cancelled the DNI Contract. Days later, SBS gave notice of its intent to
terminate all subcontracts related to the 10} ect, including the $27 million sham

consulting agreement with MFast.

34. In an effort to have the DNI Contract reinstated, defendant Sharef and
Siemensâ then-CEO formed a âcrisis management teamâ to assume control over the DNI
project. The team members included defendants Truppel, Steffen, and Signer, who

replaced Bock as Head of Major Projects at SBS in July 2001.

35. At about the same time, Siemens prepared to initiate an arbitration

' -~proceeding with the World Bankâs International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (âICSIDâ) in Washington, DC, to recover its lost profits and out of pocket costs
resulting from the cancellation of the DNI Contract. In July 2001, Siemens sent a letter
to the ICSID arbitration board in Washington, DC, to. preserve its right to file an ICSID
arbitration claim. This triggered a six-month period for settlement negotiations with the

Argentine government.

36. Notwithstanding the DNI Contractâs cancellation, defendant Sergi and the

Project Group advised Siemens that the Argentine government officials who had helped

12
Siemens secure the DNI Contract still expected to be paid the bribes they had been
promised but had not yet received. Sergi also demanded that he be retmbursed for the
bribes that he had advanced to government officials on Siemensâ behalf. If the payment
demands were not met, Sergi threatened to go public with corruption allegations against |

Siemens.

37. In order to preserve the viability of Siemensâ ICSID arbitration claim, it
was necessary for the company to-exclude from the proceeding any evidence that
Siemens had originally obtained the DNI Contract through bribery. Evidence of
corruption in the award of the contract would have presented a potential defense for the
Argentine government. In order to suppress that evidence, the defendants authorized and
paid additional bribes to Argentine officials. Sergi, Truppel, Steffen, and Bock
continuously urged Siemens management to funnel more money to Argentine officials.
Truppel urged Siemens management to pay the outstanding promised bribes to Argentine
government officials, not only to avoid disqualification from the ICSID arbitration, but -
also to prevent potential physical harm to him and other Siemens employees in

Argentina.

38. On July 6, 2001, Truppel and Bock met with Sergi and his associates in
Miami, Florida, to devise a method of paying the $27 million in bribes that had originally
_been intended to be made via the then-terminated sham MFast contract. Bock agreed to
pay Sergi $27 million to satisfy the bribery demands by the Argentine officials, and Sergi
gave instructions that the money be sent to Sergiâs Swiss bank account within thirty days.
Following the Miami meeting, Bock advised Signer of the agreement to pay $27 million

through Sergi to the Argentine officials. Bock later attempted to initiate the payment, but

13
was unable to persuade Siemensâ legal and compliance departments that the company had

a legitimate commercial basis for making it.

D. SBS Authorizes an âAdvance Paymentâ of up to $10 Million

39. Defendant Regendantz became the Chief Financial Officer of SBS in
February 2002. As soon as Regendantz arrived at SBS, defendants Signer, Steffen, and
Truppel pressured him to authorize additional bribe payments to Argentina. Defendant
Signer told Regendantz that Siemens had paid or promised approximately $70 million to
various Argentine officials to obtain the DNI Contract, and that $27 million remained

owing to the Argentine officials even though the contract had been cancelled.

40. Initially Regendantz, who had no prior dealings with the DNI Contract,
resisted authorizing the bribes. Regendantz had several meetings and telephone
conversations with defendant Steffen in the Spring of 2002 in which Steffen urged
Regendantz to authorize bribe payments from SBS to Argentine officials. In April 2002,
Steffen told Regendantz that SBS had a âmoral dutyâ to make at least an âadvance
paymentâ of $10 million to Sergi and the other payment intermediaries. Steffen claimed
that he, Truppel, and other employees of Siemens Argentina were being threatened

because the long-promised bribes remained unpaid.

41. Over a period of weeks, Regendantz sought guidance from Siemensâ Head
of Compliance, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and two members of
the Managing Board, one of whom was defendant Sharef. In each instance, Regendantz .
explained that the payment demands lacked any legitimate commercial basis and that he
was reluctant to authorize them. In each instance, Regendantzâs superiors gave every

' indication that they were familiar with the DNI Contract and with the nature of the

14
payment demands. And in each instance, his superiors told Regendantz that it was his
responsibility to find a solution to.the problem. Regendantz understood these responses

from his superiors to be an instruction that he authorize the bribe payments.

42. Ultimately, Regendantz authorized the advance payment of up to
$10 million in bribes to Argentine officials, through the Project Group. A portion of |

those bribes were paid to bank accounts in New York and Miami.

43. During this period, Siemens was negotiating with the Argentine
government pursuant to the preservation period allowed by the ICSID arbitration. In
May 2002, Siemens filed its ICSID arbitration claim, demanding over $550 million from
the Argentine government for the terminated DNI Contract. The defendants were aware

of the pending ICSID arbitration.

E. $5.2 Million Payment Through Meder Holding Corporation

44. The first tranche of the $10 million advance payment authorized by
Regendantz consisted of a $5.2 million payment to Argentine officials that was routed
through an intermediary in Uruguay. Defendants Truppel and Signer, with the help of
defendant Bock and subordinate SBS employees, generated a series of fictitious

documents to facilitate the payment and to obscure the audit trail.

45. Inthe summer of 2002, defendant Signer had Bock and a subordinate SBS
employee sign a backdated consulting agreement with Meder Holding Corporation S.A.
(âMederâ), a Uruguay front company controlled by the Project Group. Signer also
instructed the SBS employee to sign backdated invoices from Meder totaling

approximately $5.2 million.

15
46. In May 2002, defendant Truppel sent Signer the Meder invoices, which
were backdated to 2001 and early 2002. The invoices were purportedly for âmarket
development in Chile and Uruguayâ and included wire transfer instructions to a Standard
Chartered bank account in New York.. The references to âmarket development in Chile
and Uruguayâ were false. The payments were not made in connection with any such

work.

47. Regendantz instructed a subordinate to handle the paperwork related to the
bribe payments to Argentina. On July 19, 2002, Regendantzâs subordinate authorized the
$5.2 million payment to Meder, and on July 22, 2002, SBS wired the funds to the
designated Standard Chartered bank account in New York. The payment was incorrectly

recorded in Siemensâ books and records.

48. The second tranche of the $10 million âadvance,â in the amount of

approximately $4.7 million, was not made until February 2004

F. January 2003 Meeting in New York Between Defendants
Sharef and Sergi to Negotiate Further Bribe Payments

49. Following the $5.2 million Meder payment, defendant Sergi and the Project
Group continued to relay bribery demands from Argentine officials. On January 16,
2003, defendant Sharef met with Sergi in New York, NY, to negotiate the terms of
Siemensâ payment. One difficulty in responding to the demands was that, because the
DNI Contract had been terminated by the Argentine government and work on the DNI
proj ect had ceased, Siemens officials lacked a plausible business justification for making

the payments.

16
50. At the New York meeting, Sharef and Sergi addressed this problem by
devising a strategy to conduct a sham arbitration involving the then-terminated MFast
contract as a means for funneling the bribe payments to government officials in
Argentina. Siemens owed no bona fide payment obligation under the MFast contract
because the contract itself was a sham arrangement. But if MFast initiated an arbitration
proceeding against Siemens for wrongful termination and then either prevailed or
negotiated a settlement, the resulting award would be available to satisfy the longstanding
bribe demands. The sham MFast arbitration did eventually take place, but it was not

initiated until 2005.

G. $11.79 Million Payment through Dubai Intermediary in 2003

51. In the first half of 2003, much of the promised $27 million remained
unpaid, and the payment demands by Sergi on behalf of Argentine officials continued.
Defendants Signer, Truppel, and Steffen urged Sharef to meet the demands and make the
additional payments. In mid-2003, on Sharefâs instruction, the Commercial Head of
Siemens PTD, Truppel, and others initiated a plan to have Siemens PTD, a division
unrelated to the DNI project, funnel â¬9.6 million (or approximately $11.79 million) to
Sergi and the Project Group through an intermediary company in Dubai. By making the
bribe payment through PTD, the payment could be falsely recorded in Siemensâ books
and records as an expense incurred in connection with an active PTD project, rather than

with the then-terminated DNI Contract.

52. In March 2003, Sharef called the Commercial Head of PTD and told him

that Sharef needed PTDâs help in transferring funds from Siemens PTD to South America

17
in connection with an SBS project. Sharef told the PTD official that there was an urgent

need for the funds, and that the money would be reimbursed to PTD later.

53. On defendant Sharefâs instruction, the PTD official contacted the Dubai
payment intermediary and asked for its assistance in making the transfer. Sharef
instructed the PTD official to put the Dubai intermediary in touch with defendant
Truppel, who would provide payment details. Pursuant to Truppelâs payment
instructions, the Dubai intermediary transferred â¬9.6 million to bank accounts in the
Bahamas maintained by the Project Group for one or more Argentine government
officials. Using phony invoices to conceal the corrupt nature of the payment, the Dubai

intermediary charged the payment to a PTD contract unrelated to the DNI project.

54. _ Because the â¬9.6 million payment was for the benefit of an SBS project, in
. late 2003 PTD sought rermbursement of the payment amount from SBS. Defendant
Regendantz instructed his subordinate to find a way to process the reimbursement
without disclosing the underlying nature of the corrupt payment. To support the
reimbursement, the subordinate and his counterpart at PTD fabricated justifications for
fictitious invoices totaling â¬9.6 million ($11.79 million). PTD submitted the phony
invoices to SBS between December 2003 and February 2004. SBS made the |

reimbursement payments to PTD in 2004.

H. $4.7 Million Payment to Companies Linked to the Project
Group in 2004

55. The second tranche of the $10 million âadvance paymentâ authorized by
Regendantz was made in 2004. In late 2003, defendant Sharef informed the then-CEO of
Siemens Argentina that Sharef had reached an agreement to pay an additional

$4.7 million in bribes to government officials through Sergi. Sharef instructed the

18
Siemens Argentina CEO to provide defendant Sergi with whatever information Sergi

needed to prepare the fictitious invoices needed to support the $4.7 million payment.

56. Sergi, on instructions from Sharef, submitted eight fictitious invoices
totaling $4.7 million to the Siemens Argentina CEO, who then forwarded them to
Regendantz. The invoices were purportedly for âconsulting servicesâ provided to SBS
by four companies, each affiliated with MFast. The invoices were not linked to any

identifiable contracts, nor were they linked to any projects on SBSâs books and records.

57. Regendantz instructed his subordinate to handle payment of the invoices.
The subordinate noticed an error in one of the invoices and called the Siemens Argentina
CEO, telling him, âif we have to produce crap, we should at least do it correctly.â The
Siemens Argentina CEO submitted revised invoices. Regendantzâs subordinate then
generated a memo, backdated to October 10, 2003, to support the sham projects and
expenses reflected by the invoices. Defendant Signer instructed an SBS subordinate to

sign the backdated, fictitious invoices supporting the $4.7 million payment.

58. Payments to two of the companies identified on the invoices were made in
February 2004 to bank accounts held at the International Bank of Miami. Siemens

improperly accounted for the payments as âconsulting expensesâ in its books and records.

59. Between 2002 and 2006, Regendantz signed quarterly and annual
certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act falsely representing that the financial
statements of SBS âdo not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which such statements were made, not misleading.â The quarterly certifications

also falsely represented that the financial statements of SBS âfairly present in all material

19
respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.â The quarterly and
annual certifications were presented to the auditors of SBS and Siemens in connection

with the companiesâ quarterly reviews and annual audits.

I. The ICSID Arbitration in Washington, DC

60. In May 2002, Siemens instituted an arbitration proceeding against the
government of Argentina through the ICSID in Washington, DC, seeking $550 million in
lost profits and expenses as a result of Argentinaâs allegedly wrongful termination of the
DNI Contract. Had the government of Argentina introduced evidence showing that
Siemens had obtained the DNI Contract through bribery, that evidence would have stood
as a defense to the companyâs breach-of-contract claim. Siemens, however, succeeded in
âkeeping any evidence or allegation of bribery out of the ICSID arbitration until
September 2005, by which time the evidence was too late to be considered. Siemens
suppressed the evidence of corruption through the false testimony of defendants Truppel,
Bock, and Sharef, and by paying the bribes demanded by Sergi and the Project Group,

which had threatened to disclose the corrupt nature of the DNI Contract.

61. In September 2005, the government of Argentina did invoke corruption as
a defense to Siemensâ arbitration claim. Despite knowing the truth -- that the DNI
Contract had indeed been obtained through large-scale bribery -- Siemens officially
denied the corruption allegations. Argentina ultimately lost its ability to assert the

defense on the ground that the defense had not been timely raised.

62. On February 6, 2007, Siemens was awarded $217,838,430 in the ICSID
arbitration against the government of Argentina for Siemensâ loss of investment, plus

interest. This award represented the economic benefit that Siemensâ bribery scheme had

20
long sought to obtain. However, in August 2009, after settling bribery charges with the
Commission, the Department of J ustice, and the Munich Public Prosecutor, Siemens

waived the ICSID award.

J. The MF ast Arbitration
63. On March 15, 2005, MFast initiated a private arbitration proceeding against
SBS with the International Chamber of Commerce (âICCâ) in Zurich; Switzerland, to
recover the $27 million in bribe payments that it had been promised for Argentine
officials under the corrupt contract it signed with SBS in January 2001. Siemens did not |
attempt to defend the ICC arbitration on the grounds that the MFast contract was part of
an illegal bribery scheme involving the DNI Contract. Nor did Siemens reveal that the
ICC arbitration was a sham proceeding concocted by defendants Sharef and Sergi during
their meeting in New York. Instead, once the arbitration commenced, Siemensâ
management withheld any evidence of corruption from the ICC proceeding and quickly
settled with MFast. The settlement kept the MFast bribery scheme from coming to light
and thereby endangering the hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in the then-pending

ICSID arbitration.

64. Due to his involvement in the DNI project as Head of Major Projects,
defendant Bock was called to testify in both the ICSID and MFast arbitration
proceedings. Instead of-revealing the corruption and bribery surrounding the DNI and
MFast contracts, Bock concealed the illicit bribery activity in Argentina. In return for
Bockâs silence, defendant Signer and others arranged for Siemens to pay Bock and a
family member approximately $316,000 from 2005 to 2007 through sham consulting

agreements.

21
- 65. On November 9, 2006, despite knowing that the sole purpose of the MFast
contract was to funnel bribes to Argentine government officials, Siemensâ management
settled the ICC arbitration by agreeing to pay MFast $8.8 million. Payment was made in

January 2007.

66. The $8.8 million payment was itself a bribe designed to satisfy defendant
Sergi and the Argentine government officials who were owed money, and to keep them
from revealing the extensive bribery surrounding the DNI Contract. The settlement
agreement with MFast expressly barred Sergi and his associates from âinvolv{ing]
themselves in [the ICSID Arbitration Proceedings], either directly or indirectly, or in any
other manner influenc[ing] said proceedings, even if only by passing on information....â
The settlement agreement also barred Sergi and his associates from serving as witnesses

in the ICSID proceedings.

SEC Charges Seven Former Siemens Executives with
Bribing Leaders in Argentina

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-263

Washington, D.C., Dec. 13, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged seven former Siemens executives with violating the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for their involvement in the company's decade-
long bribery scheme to retain a $1 billion government contract to produce
national identity cards for Argentine citizens.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 22190

Â» SEC Complaint
Â® Spotlight on FCPA Cases

 

Siemens was previously charged with FCPA violations and paid $1.6 billion to
resolve the charges with the SEC, U.S. Department of Justice, and Office of the
Prosecutor General in Munich.

The SEC alleges that the executives who perpetuated the scheme worked at
Siemens and its regional company Siemens Argentina. One of the executives
had left Siemens and acted as a payment intermediary in the scheme.
Siemens paid more than $100 million in bribes to such high-ranking officials
as two former Argentine presidents and former cabinet members. The
executives falsified documents including invoices and sham consulting
contracts, and participated in meetings in the United States to negotiate the
terms of bribe payments. They used U.S. bank accounts to pay some of the
bribes.

""Business should flow to the company with the best product and the best
price, not the best bribe,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division
of Enforcement. ""Corruption erodes public trust and the transparency of our
commercial markets, and undermines corporate governance.""

In a parallel criminal action, the Department of Justice announced charges
against former executives and agents of Siemens. They are charged with
conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the wire fraud statute, money laundering
conspiracy and wire fraud.

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the
scheme lasted from approximately 1996 to early 2007. Initially, the bribes
were paid to secure a $1 billion contract to produce national identity cards
known as Documentos Nacionales de Identidad (DNI) for every Argentine
citizen. After a change in Argentine political administrations resulted in the
DNI contract being suspended and then canceled, Siemens paid additional
bribes in a failed effort to revive the DNI contract. When the company later
instituted an arbitration proceeding to recover its costs and expected profits
from the canceled contract, Siemens paid additional bribes to suppress
evidence that the contract originally had been obtained through corruption.

The former Siemens and Siemens Argentina executives charged by the SEC
each had a role in authorizing, negotiating, facilitating, or concealing bribe
payments in connection with the DNI contract:

e Uriel Sharef - A former managing board member at Siemens from July
2000 to December 2007. He met in the United States with payment
intermediaries and agreed to pay $27 million in bribes to Argentine
officials in connection with the DNI contract.

e Ulrich Bock - Former Commercial Head of Major Projects for Siemens
Business Services (SBS) from October 1995 to 2001. As the officer
responsible for the DNI contract, he authorized bribe payments to
Argentine government officials.

e Stephan Signer -Replaced Bock as Commercial Head of Major Projects
for SBS and later became Head of Business Operations and Finance at
Siemens IT Solutions and Services. He authorized the payment of bribes
to government officials in Argentina.

e Herbert Steffen -CEO of Siemens Argentina from 1983 to 1989 and
again in 1991, and Group President of Siemens Transportation Systems
from 1996 to 2003. Due to his longstanding connections in Argentina
and Latin America, Steffen was recruited by Sharef and met directly
with Argentine officials and offered bribe payments on behalf of
Siemens.

e Andres Truppel -CFO of Siemens Argentina from 1996 to 2002. He
regularly communicated with Argentine government officials regarding
illicit bribe payments and participated in U.S.-based meetings where
bribes were negotiated and promised.

e Carlos Sergi -A former board member of Siemens Argentina and a
business consultant for Siemens Argentina. His primary role was to
serve as a payment intermediary between Siemens and Argentine
government officials in connection with the DNI contract.

e Bernd Regendantz -CFO of SBS from February 2002 to 2004. He
authorized two bribe payments totaling approximately $10 million on
Siemensâ behalf.

According to the SEC's complaint, approximately $31.3 million of the $100
million in bribes paid were made after March 12, 2001, when Siemens became
a U.S. issuer subject to U.S. securities laws. As a result of the bribe payments
it made, Siemens received an arbitration award in 2007 against the
government of Argentina of more than $217 million plus interest for the DNI
contract. In August 2009, after settling bribery charges with the U.S. and
Germany, Siemens waived the arbitration award.

The SEC complaint alleges that Bock, Regendantz, Sergi, Sharef, Signer,
Steffen, and Truppel each violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, and aided and abetted Siemens' violations of Section 30A. The
complaint also alleges that they violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and
Rule 13b2-1 thereunder by authorizing or directing others to falsify
documents in furtherance of the bribery scheme. Regendantz violated Rule
13b2-2 by signing false internal certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley
Act (SOX). They each also aided and abetted Siemensâ violations of Exchange
Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) by substantially assisting in the
company's failure to maintain internal controls to detect and prevent bribery
of government officials in Argentina, and by substantially assisting in the
improper recording of the bribe payments in Siemens' accounting books and
records.

Regendantz settled the SEC charges without admitting or denying the
allegations by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently
enjoins him from committing future violations. He paid a â¬30,000
administrative fine ordered by the Munich prosecutor (equivalent to $40,000
in U.S. dollars).

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Tracy L. Price, Robert Dodge, and
Denise Hansberry of the Enforcement Division's FCPA Unit that is headed by
Kara Brockmeyer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department
of Justice's Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District
of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the
Prosecutor General in Munich.

l. This action arises from multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 (the âFCPAâ) by defendant Magyar Telekom, Plc. (âMagyar
Telekomâ) and corresponding violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the FCPA by Magyar Telekomâs parent company, defendant Deutsche
Telekom, AG (âDeutsche Telekomâ).

2. In 2005 and 2006, senior executives then employed at Magyar Telekom,
including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, organized, approved, and executed a
plan to bribe government officials in the Republic of Macedonia to delay or prevent the
introduction of a new competitor to Magyar Telekomâs subsidiaries operating in
Macedonia and to obtain certain regulatory benefits. Magyar Telekom, through its
subsidiaries in Macedonia, made payments of â¬4.875 million during 2005 and 2006 to an
intermediary under the guise of bogus âconsultingâ and âmarketingâ contracts that did

not have any legitimate business purpose. The payments were made with the knowledge,

-l-
the firm belief, or under circumstances that made it substantially certain, that all or a.
portion of the proceeds would be offered, promised or paid to Macedonian government
officials. In return, the officials would agree to adopt regulatory ctianges favorable to
Magyar Telekomâs business and prevent a new competitor from entering the market. The
former executives also offered or promised Macedonian political party officials a
valuable business opportunity in return for the partyâs support of Magyar Telekomâs
desired benefits.

3. _ In 2005, the same executives then employed at Magyar Telekom
organized, approved, and executed a second corrupt scheme in which they authorized
~ Magyar Telekom and its affiliates to make payments intended to channel and conceal
corrupt payments to government officials in the Republic of Montenegro. Magyar
Telekom and its subsidiaries in Montenegro made payments of â¬7.35 million to several
third-party consultants under four sham contracts and received no legitimate value in
return. These payments were made with the knowledge, the firm belief, or under
circumstances that made it substantially certain, that all or a portion of the payments
would be offered, promised, or paid to Montenegrin officials to facilitate Magyar
Telekomâs acquisition of Telekom Crne Gore A.D. (âTCGâ) on favorable terms.

4. During the relevant period, Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom
lacked sufficient internal accounting controls to prevent and detect violations of the
FCPA. Asa result, the contracts described above were not subjected to meaningful
review, and substantially all of the amounts were paid without question, prior to the
initiation of an internal investigation at the direction of the Audit Committee of Magyar

Telekom.
5. Magyar Telekom recorded the payments to third-parties under these
contracts on its books and records in a manner that did not accurately reflect the true
purpose of the contracts. The false entries in Magyar Telekomâs books and records were
consolidated into the books and records of Deutsche Telekom, which reports the results

of Magyar Telekomâs operations in its consolidated financial statements.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),
21(e) and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].

7. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange
Act because acts or transactions constituting federal securities law violations occurred
within the Southern District of New York.

8. Magyar Telekom, directly or indirectly, made use of the mails and of the
means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in furtherance of the acts, practices
and courses of business described in this Complaint.

9. At all relevant times, Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom were
United States issuers that each filed reports on Form 20-F with the Commission pursuant

to Section 13 of the Exchange Act.

DEFENDANTS
10. Magyar Telekom is a limited liability stock corporation organized under
_ the laws of Hungary and headquartered in Budapest. Magyar Telekom is the largest

telecommunications company in Hungary. Magyar Telekom operates subsidiaries in
Macedonia, Montenegro, and other countries. At all relevant times, Magyar Telekomâs
securities were publicly traded through American Depository Receipts (âADRsâ) listed
on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ) and registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. Effective November 12, 2010, Magyar
Telekom voluntarily delisted its ADRs from trading on the NYSE.

11. Deutsche Telekom is a private stock corporation organized under the laws
of Germany and headquartered in Bonn, Germany. Deutsche Telekom acquired an
approximately 60% controlling interest in Magyar Telekom in July 2000 and reports the
results of Magyar Telekomâs operations in its consolidated financial statements.

Deutsche Telekomâs shares were publicly traded through ADRs listed on the NYSE and
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. Effective
June 18, 2010, Deutsche Telekom voluntarily delisted its ADRs from trading on the

NYSE.

- OTHER RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES

12. Makedonski Telekommunikacii A.D. Skopje (âMakTelâ) is the former
state-owned telecommunications services provider in Macedonia. In January 2001,
Magyar Telekom, acting in a consortium with other bidders, acquired partial ownership
of MakTel through a privatization by the Macedonian government. By late 2004,
Magyar Telekom had acquired sole ownership of an approximately 51% stake in MakTel
by purchasing additional shares from the Macedonian government and from private
shareholders. Magyar Telekom now holds its MakTel shares through a wholly-owned
holding company. The Macedonian government currently retains an approximately 35%

stake in MakTel.
| 13. Telekom Crne Gore A.D. (n/k/a-Crnogorski Telekom) (âTCGâ) is the
former state-owned public telecommunications services provider in Montenegro. In
March 2005, Magyar Telekom acquired an approximately 51% interest in TCG from the
Government of Montenegro through a privatization. At the same time, Magyar Telekom

acquired an additional approximately 22% stake in TCG from minority shareholders.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A. Violations of the FCPA in Macedonia

14. During 2005 and 2006, senior executives then employed by Magyar
Telekom (the âformer executivesâ) offered, promised, authorized and/or paid money or a
thing of value to corruptly influence Macedonian government and political party officials
in order to obtain their agreement to provide Magyar Telekom with business and
regulatory benefits.

15. | The former executives caused Magyar Telekom subsidiaries in Macedonia
to pay at least â¬4.875 million to a third-party under a series of sham marketing and
consulting contracts. The former executives knew or firmly believed that the third-party
would offer, promise, or pay all or a portion of the payments to government officials in
exchange for business and regulatory benefits to Magyar Telekom, or the circumstances
were such that made this result substantially certain to occur. They also offered a
Macedonian minority political party within the coalition government the opportunity to
designate the beneficiary of a business venture in exchange for their partyâs support of
Magyar Telekomâs desired benefits.

16. In early 2005, the Macedonian Parliament enacted a new Electronic |

Communications Law designed to liberalize the telecommunications market in a manner
that would have been unfavorable to Magyar Telekom. Specifically, among other things,
the law authorized the telecommunications regulatory bodies in Macedonia to hold a
public tender for a license to operate a third mobile telephone business that would
directly compete in Macedonia against Magyar Telekomâs subsidiary, MakTel, and
imposed increased frequency fees and other regulatory burdens.

17. The former executives devised and executed a plan to corruptly influence
government officials from both political parties in Macedoniaâs coalition government in
order to obtain regulatory advantages sought by Magyar Telekom in light of the new law.
In approximately May 2005, two of the former executives approved and executed a secret
agreement with a senior Macedonian government official to delay or preclude the
issuance of a third mobile telephone license and to mitigate the other adverse effects of
the new law, including not requiring MakTel to pay the increased frequency fee. In
approximately August 2005, two of the former executives approved and executed a
similar secret agreement with a senior Macedonian government official from the other
political party to obtain the same business and regulatory benefits. The agreements were
unlawful under Macedonian law because they were in violation of the recently enacted
Electronics Communications Law, required the officials to ignore their lawful duties, and
were not properly recorded as official government documents.

18. The Macedonian government officials consented to the agreements after
the former Magyar Telekom executives offered to direct separate payments of up to
â¬10 million in three installments between June 2005 and June 2006 to or for the benefit
- of government officials. Between 2005 and 2006, as Magyar Telekom received the

benefits promised in the agreement, the former Magyar Telekom executives authorized
payments by MakTel and other Magyar Telekom subsidiaries of â¬4.875 million to a
Greek intermediary through at least six false âsuccess fee basedâ contracts for
âconsultingâ and âmarketingâ services. These contracts were executed with the
knowledge or firm belief that some or all of the payments under the contracts would be
offered, promised or paid to government officials, or under circumstances that made such
a result substantially certain to occur.

19. The only executed copies of the two agreements with the government
officials were retained by the Greek intermediary, and the existence and true purpose of
the agreements were unknown to anyone within Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom
other than the former executives and a small number of additional participants.

20. The former executives structured the contracts with the Greek
intermediary for the purpose of circumventing Magyar Telekomâs internal controls and
avoiding detection. The consulting and marketing contracts entered into in 2005 and
2006 generally were backdated or contained success-based contingencies that had already
been satisfied by the time they were executed, and were supported by false performance
certificates or other fabricated evidence of performance. The contracts served no
legitimate business purpose, and no valuable performance was rendered under them.
Instead, the contracts were used to funnel money, which the former executives referred to
amongst themselves in code as âlogistics,â to a third party in circumstances in which the
former executives knew, had the firm belief, or in which it was substantially certain that
it would be offered, promised or paid, in full or in part, to government officials.

21. In addition, the former Magyar Telekom executives offered a contract for

a valuable business opportunity to an entity designated by the minority political party as
part of their effort to secure the benefits sought by Magyar Telekom. Although the
contract was executed by one of the former executives, the business opportunity
ultimately was not developed. .

22.. Asaresult of these payments and offer, the Macedonian government
delayed the introduction of a third mobile telephone competitor until 2007, by which time
(1) an intervening election had occurred and a new coalition government had obtained
control in Macedonia; and (2) the former executives had resigned from Magyar Telekom.
Macedonian government officials also unlawfully reduced the frequency fee tariffs

imposed on MakTel. |

23. Certain electronic communications made in furtherance of the improper
payments and the concealment of the payments, including drafts of the agreements with
the government officials and the offer to the minority party official, and copies of certain
of the contracts with the intermediary, were transmitted by Magyar Telekom employees
and others through U.S. interstate commerce or stored on computer servers located in the
United States.

24. The payments made under these contracts were recorded on Magyar
Telekomâs books and records in a manner that did not accurately reflect the true purposes
of the contracts under which they were made, and were consolidated into Deutsche
Telekomâs financial statements. At the time the payments were made, Magyar Telekom
and Deutsche Telekom lacked sufficient internal accounting controls to provide

reasonable assurances that the transactions were legitimate and recorded appropriately.
B. FCPA Violations in Montenegro

25. In 2005, the former executives engaged in a scheme to have Magyar
Telekom and its subsidiaries corruptly influence government officials in Montenegro in
an effort to acquire TCG, the former state-owned telecommunications company. In
furtherance of this scheme, Magyar Telekom and its subsidiaries paid â¬7.35 million under
four bogus consulting contracts with the knowledge, the firm belief, or under
circumstances that made it substantially certain, that the payments would be offered,
promised or paid to government officials in Montenegro to facilitate the TCG acquisition
on terms favorable to Magyar Telekom.

26. In October 2004, the Government of Montenegro issued a tender to
privatize its approximately 51% stake of the state-owned telecommunications company,
_ TCG. Magyar Telekom submitted a bid that sought to obtain a super-majority ownership
stake, consisting of the governmentâs 51% share, plus enough additional minority shares
from private investors to give Magyar Telekom ownership of at least two-thirds of TCG.
The Board of Directors of Magyar Telekom, in accordance with the decision of the
Management Board of Deutsche Telekom, limited the price that Magyar Telekom could
pay on a price per share basis for the acquisition. Magyar Telekomâs bid for the
government shares was conditioned on its ability to acquire the minority shares at the
intended valuation.

| 27. | Magyar Telekom prevailed in the public tender process, but the

Montenegrin government rejected Magyar Telekomâs provision to condition the
acquisition upon acquiring a super-majority stake. The share purchase agreement

ultimately was executed without this condition.
28. By March 2005, Magyar Telekom ultimately succeeded in acquiring an
approximately 73% stake in TCG on its desired terms, but only after government officials
committed the Government of Montenegro to contribute an additional â¬0.30 per share to
the private shareholders.

29. After the Government of Montenegro facilitated Magyar Telekomâs
acquisition of shares of TCG from minority shareholders, the former executives caused
Magyar Telekom, TCG, and its affiliates to make payments to third-parties with the
knowledge, firm belief, or under circumstances that made it substantially certain, that
some or all of those payments would be offered, promised or paid to individuals who had
been government officials at the time of the TCG acquisition.

30. | Magyar Telekom entered into two nearly-identical contracts with two
third-party consultants, purportedly for assistance in purchasing the additional shares
from the minority shareholders. The consultants were shell companies based in the
Republic of Mauritius and the Republic of the Seychelles that had never before provided
services to Magyar Telekom or Deutsche Telekom, and one of the entities was not even |
legally incorporated when its contract was purportedly signed. Two of the former
executives executed the contracts on Magyar Telekomâs behalf after Magyar Telekom
had already acquired TCG, but backdated the contracts. These contracts concealed the
true parties-in-interest and the third-party consultants performed no legitimate services
under either of these contracts. Documents purportedly evidencing the consultantsâ
performance under the contracts were fabricated to give the appearance that the

consultants rendered legitimate services.

-10-
31. The former executives caused Magyar Telekom to make two payments
totaling â¬4.47 million under these contracts between approximately May 12 and May 20,
2005. The former executives of Magyar Telekom either knew or held a firm belief that
all or a portion of the payments would be offered, promised or paid to government
officials, or circumstances existed that made such a result substantially certain to occur.

32. TCGandaTCG affiliate entered into two additional consulting contracts
in 2005 that purported to relate to Magyar Telekomâs acquisition of TCG. Both contracts -
were executed with the knowledge and approval of the former Magyar Telekom
executives.

33. | One of these contracts purported to require a New York, NY-based
counterparty to provide vaguely-identified assistance in connection with the acquisition
and integration of TCG into Magyar Telekomâs corporate structure. One of the former
Magyar Telekom executives signed the contract on behalf of a TCG affiliate and
backdated it. The TCG affiliate made payments of â¬580,000 under this contract.

34. This contract actually was intended to conceal payments made to the sister
of a senior Montenegrin government official through a nominee entity identified in the
contract. The officialâs sister did not actually render any bona fide services to Magyar
Telekom or TCG under the contract. Magyar Telekom falsely recorded the payments
under this contract as a consulting expense on its accounting books and records.

35. The other sham consulting contract was with a shell company based at a
residential address in London. Under the contract, the consultant purportedly would
provide Magyar Telekom with strategic advice related to the telecommunications market

in Southeastern Europe. However, none of the reports provided by the consultant

-11-
represented original work. Instead, each report bore a mark on each page identifying the
report as the product of another consulting firm. The consultant provided no legitimate
services to Magyar Telekom. Although a TCG affiliate paid â¬2.3 million the consultant
between approximately November 7 and December 28, 2005, Magyar Telekomâs auditors
valued the reports provided at approximately â¬20,000.

36. | These two consulting contracts (1) concealed the true counterparties;

(2) did not accurately describe the true services to be rendered; (3) purported to be
success based, but were entered into after the relevant contingencies had already been
satisfied by other service providers; (4) served no legitimate business purpose, and

(5) were supported by false performance certificates or fabricated evidence of
performance. The services under these contracts also duplicated services that had
previously been provided to Magyar Telekom by known parties for substantially lower
prices.

37. | The payments under the four contracts described above were recorded on
Magyar Telekomâs books and records in a manner that did not accurately reflect the true
purposes of the contracts under which they were made, and were consolidated into
Deutsche Telekomâs financial statements. At the time the payments were made, Magyar
Telekom and Deutsche Telekom lacked sufficient internal accounting controls to provide

reasonable assurances that transactions were legitimate and recorded appropriately.

SEC Charges Magyar Telekom and Former Executives
with Bribing Officials in Macedonia and Montenegro

Firm and Parent Company Agree to Pay $95 Million to Settle Civil and
Criminal Charges

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-279

Washington, D.C., Dec. 29, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange
Commission today charged the largest telecommunications provider in
Hungary and three of its former top executives with bribing government and
political party officials in Macedonia and Montenegro to win business and shut
out competition in the telecommunications industry.

 

Additional Materials

Â» SEC complaint v. the companies
Â®Â» SEC Complaint v. the executives
Â» Litigation Release No. LR-22213

 

The SEC alleges that three senior executives at Magyar Telekom Plc.
orchestrated, approved, and executed a plan to bribe Macedonian officials in
2005 and 2006 to prevent the introduction of a new competitor and gain
other regulatory benefits. Magyar Telekom's subsidiaries in Macedonia made
illegal payments of approximately $6 million under the guise of bogus
consulting and marketing contracts. The same executives orchestrated a
second scheme in 2005 in Montenegro related to Magyar Telekom's
acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company there. Magyar
Telekom paid approximately $9 million through four sham contracts to funnel
money to government officials in Montenegro.

Magyar Telekom's parent company Deutsche Telekom AG also is charged with
books and records and internal controls violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA).

Magyar Telekom agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying more than
$31.2 million in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest. Magyar Telekom
also agreed to pay a $59.6 million criminal penalty as part of a deferred
prosecution agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Deutsche Telekom settled the SEC's charges, and as part of a non-prosecution
agreement with the Department of Justice agreed to pay a penalty of $4.36
million.

""Magyar Telekom's senior executives used sham contracts to funnel millions
of dollars in corrupt payments to foreign officials who could help them keep
competitors out and win business,"" said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the
SEC Enforcement Division's FCPA Unit. ""They purposely structured the sham
contracts to circumvent internal review, and when questions were eventually
raised about their use of 'consulting' contracts, they reconfigured them as
âmarketingâ contracts to avoid scrutiny and prolong their scheme.""

The three former top executives at Magyar Telekom charged by the SEC for
orchestrating the bribery schemes are:

e Elek Straub, former Chairman and CEO.

e Andras Balogh, former Director of Central Strategic Organization.

Â® Tamas Morvai, former Director of Business Development and
Acquisitions.

According to the SEC's complaints filed in the Southern District of New York, in
the wake of legislation intended to liberalize the Macedonian
telecommunications market, Magyar Telekom entered into a secret
agreement entitled the ""Protocol of Cooperation"" with senior Macedonian
government officials to delay or preclude the issuance of a license to a new
competitor and mitigate other adverse effects of the new law. To win their
support, Magyar Telekom paid â¬4.875 million to a third-party intermediary
under a series of sham contracts with the intention that the intermediary
would forward money to the government officials. Magyar Telekom also
promised a Macedonian political party the opportunity to designate the
beneficiary of a business venture in exchange for the party's support.

The SEC further alleges that in Montenegro, Magyar Telekom used
intermediaries to pay bribes to government officials in return for their support
of Magyar Telekom's acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications
company on terms favorable to Magyar Telekom. At least two Montenegrin
government officials involved in the acquisition received payments made
through the bogus contracts. A family member of a top Montenegrin
government official also received payments.
The SEC's complaint against Straub, Balogh, and Morvai alleges that they
violated or aided and abetted violations of the anti-bribery, books and
records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA; knowingly circumvented
internal controls and falsified books and records; and made false statements
to the company's auditor. The SEC seeks disgorgement and penalties and the
imposition of permanent injunctions. Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom
consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the
SEC's allegations. The settlements are subject to court approval.

The SEC's case was investigated by Adam Eisner under the supervision of
Charles Cain, Deputy Chief of the FCPA Unit. Robert Dodge will lead the SEC's
litigation efforts. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of
the Department of Justice's Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. The SEC also acknowledges the assistance provided by the
Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority, the German Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (BaFin), and the Swiss Office of the Attorney General.

iption: General Civil
MAXWELL TECHNOLOGIES INC., Description: G C

Defendant.

 

Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ), alleges:
a COMPLA 1 OT |
SUMMARY

1. Maxwell Technologies Inc. (âMaxwellâ) is a manufacturer of energy storage
and power delivery products. From 2002 through May 2009, Maxwell violated the anti-
bribery, books and records and â control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (âFCPAâ) when it repeatedly paid bribes to Chinese officials in order to
obtain and retain sales contracts for high voltage capacitors from several Chinese state-
owned entities. Maxwell engaged in bribery to maintain its high-voltage capacitor
business in China, which accounted for material revenue and profits during the relevant
time period.
2. From 2002 through May 2009, Maxwell, through its wholly-owned Swiss
subsidiary, Maxwell Technologies SA (âMaxwell SAâ), paid over $2.5 million in
kickback payments to officials at several Chinese state-owned entities through a third-
party sales agent (âChinese Agentâ). The Chinese Agent made these payments with the

purpose and effect of improperly influencing decisions by foreign officials to assist

- Maxwell to obtain and retain sales contracts for high voltage capacitors produced by
Maxwell SA. The illicit payments were made with the knowledge and tacit approval of
certain former Maxwell officers. Maxwell failed io accurately record these payments on
its books and records, and failed to implement or maintain a system of effective internal
accounting controls to detect or prevent the payments.

3. In all, the improper payments generated nearly $15.4 million in sales
contracts, from which Maxwell realized profits of over $5.6 million. These sales
contracts âwere included in Maxwell revenues during the relevant period.

4. Maxwell violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) by engaging in widespread bribery of government officials in China in
order to sell its high-voltage capacitors to several Chinese state-owned enterprises.
Maxwell violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-
13 thereunder by failing to disclose in its annual and periodic filings that the material
revenues and profits associated with its long-standing bribery scheme enabled Maxwell
to better financially position itself until new products could be commercially developed
and sold. Maxwell violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to
maintain internal controls to prevent or detect the bribes paid to officials at Chinese state-
owned-entities. Finally, Maxwell violated 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by failing to

accurately reflect the nature of the improper payments in Maxwellâs books, records, and

accounts.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE -
5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27

of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. Maxwell, directly and

indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the
mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
6. Venue is appropriate in the Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78aa] because certain of the acts or transactions constituting violations by
Maxwell occurred in this district.
DEFENDANT

Act and related rules thereunder.

RELEVANT PARTIES
8. Maxwell Technologies SA (""Maxwell SA""), previously known as Montena
Components Ltd. (âMontenaâ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maxwell acquired in 2002,
manufactures and sells high-voltage capacitors in several countries, including China.
Maxwell SA is incorporated and headquartered in Switzerland. Maxwell SA's financial
results were consolidated with those of Maxwell throughout the relevant petiod.
9. Executive A, a Swiss national, was the Senior Vice President, General
Manager of Maxwell SA during the relevant period. Executive A had overall

responsibility for Maxwellâs global high voltage capacitor business. . Executive A left the
company in July 2009.
10. Chinese Agent, a Chinese national, was Maxwell SAâs third-party agent

responsible for high-voltage capacitor sales to Chinese customers from at least 2002 until

May 2009.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Background
11. . Maxwell manufactures energy storage and power delivery products. Its

wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell SA, manufactures and sells high-voltage
capacitors in several countries, including China. Maxwellâs high-voltage capacitors,
which are used mainly in the electric utility industry, prevent high-voltage arcing that can
damage equipment that transmits, distributes, or measures electricity.

12. Maxwell is the market leader in the high-voltage capacitor business and the
high-margin product line is consistently profitable. The product is also one of the most
mature products that Maxwell manufactures and sells. In October 2009, Maxwellâs |
current CEO succinctly described the importance of the companyâs high-voltage product
line to investors:

Last year [2008], we had just under $40 million in sales. It's about a 50-year-old
business to us. It's a mature technology. We have a dominant market share in the
world. In 2008, about 30% of that revenue was shipped to China.!

13. During the relevant period, Maxwellâs revenues in this dominant but mature |
product line helped offset losses that Maxwell has incurred to develop new products, such

as ultracapacitors (essentially smaller energy storage and power delivery products), that

are now expected to become Maxwellâs future source of revenue growth. Historically,

 

Remarks of Maxwell Technologies CEO dated October 13, 2009 (final transcript).

4
Maxwell SA used a single third-party agent, the Chinese Agent, to market and sell its
high voltage capacitors to Chinese customers, substantially all of which are Chinese

state-owned entities.

Maxwellâs Bribery Scheme

14. From 2002 through May 2009, Maxwell repeatedly paid bribes through the
Chinese Agent to officials at state-owned entities in China. During the relevant period,
the Chinese Agent would request quotes from Maxwell SA on behalf. of prospective
Chinese state-owned entities. Upon instruction by the Chinese Agent, an âextraâ 20%
was added to the quoted amounts to arrive at a higher price for the high voltage
equipment. The artificially inflated amount was then added to the purchase orders.
Maxwell SA then invoiced the Chinese state-owned entities for equipment at the higher-
priced rate, which the entities paid upon receipt of the equipment. The Chinese Agent
then would invoice Maxwell SA for the âextraâ 20% added to the quoted prices, which he
classified in his invoices to Maxwell SA as either âExtra Amountâ or âSpecial
Arrangementâ fees (collectively referred to as âExtra Amountâ or âExtra Amountsâ).
Upon receipt, the agent would pay the Extra Amounts to officials at the Chinese state-
owned entities.

15. This arrangement was knowingly perpetuated and approved by Executive A,
who had a long-standing working relationship with the Chinese Agent. Executive A
approved the Chinese Agent sales contracts with the Chinese state-owned Ã©fitities
knowing that the purchase orders were inflated by 20% with the intention that the 20% be
paid as bribes to Chinese foreign officials to obtain the contracts.

16. Certain former U.S. officers at Maxwell knew about the improper payments at
least as far back as November 2002. For example, in a November 2002 email, Maxwellâs
former controller, a U.S. citizen, indicated concern that a payment made in connection
with doing high-voltage business in China appeared to be âa kick-back, pay-off, bribe,
whatever you want to call it, . ... This type of payment is in violation of US trade laws.â
In response, Maxwellâs former CEO, a U.S. citizen, replied â[T]his is a well know[n]
issue. I will ask [Maxwellâs former V.P. Sales] to assist you guys, he has familiarity with
the issues and solutions. No more emails please... .â

17. In October 2003, Maxwellâs former controller received an email from a
former Maxwell SA officer that provided, in part: âwe should not have indicated the
name of the company in the wiring as this money is not supposed to go back to the
company. . . . the general rule re. extra amounts is that [the] name of beneficiary must not
be the one of the company,â which suggested that the former controller knew, or should
have known, that the Extra Amounts were bribes and not commissions meant for the
Chinese Agent. Other documents and email also show that Maxwell knew or should
have known of the bribery scheme.

18. The Joi araning bribery scheme enabled Maxwell to report reduced losses
and increased revenues that became material as the illegal activities grew during the
relevant period. For example, although the illegal activity dated back to at least 2002,
Maxwell SAâs high voltage capacitor sales obtained through bribery steadily increased

during the latter years 2005 to first quarter of 2009:

1Q-09 | $3,213,288 13.9% $1,049,979 | 35.4%
19. Maxwell greatly depended on the revenue from Maxwell SAâs high-voltage

capacitor sales to China in order to help fund Maxwellâs expansion into new product lines
that are now expected to become Maxwellâs future source of revenue. Maxwell engaged
in the bribery scheme because it enabled the company to obtain material revenue needed
to financially position itself to help fund the very products that today are sustaining
Maxwellâs future growth. Even after including profits generated from the bribery,
Maxwell historically pemeniel net losses that required it to raise additional capital from
investors to fund its operations. From 2002 through 2009, Maxwell did not experience a
year in which it generated both net profits and positive cash flows from operations,
although it may reverse that trend in 2010.

20. In all, from 2002 through 2009, Maxwell paid over $2.5 milliorrin bribes to
Chinese official of state-owned enterprises. During the relevant period, Maxwell
accounted for the bribe payments as sales commission expenses in its financials. In the
Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, Maxwell reclassified the

kickbacks for current and prior periods as a reduction in revenue.
Discovery of the Illicit Payments

21. Potential FCPA and accounting concerns came to the attention of Maxwellâs
finance department in September 2008, during an internal review of Maxwell SAâs
commission expenses involving the Chinese Agent. Maxwellâs management team asked
about these commission payments after learning of the unusually high Chinese Agent
commissions, which included the Extra Amounts. During this review, Executive A
informed Maxwellâs finance department that the payments made to the Chinese Agent
were recorded as sales commissions. Maxwellâs finance department then sought and
obtained a signed FCPA certificate from the Chinese Agent in which he represented that
he was familiar with the U.S. FCPA and âlocal laws and regulations regarding corrupt

paymentsâ; and:

certifies that he has not in the past and will not in the future make any payment of anything of value to:

{@ any government official, member of political party or candidate for policital office (as defined in the FCPA),for
the purpose of influencing such government official or causing such official to use influence to obtain business or
secure an improper advantage for Maxwell S.A. or its affiliates; or

ii) to any other person knowing that the payment will be used for the foregoing purpose.
22. After obtaining the representations, Maxwellâs finance department took no
further corrective action regarding the commissions and Extra Amounts paid to the
Chinese Agent in 2008.
23. During a business trip to China in February 2009, a new Maxwell SA sales
director was informed by the Chinese Agent that the agent was passing the overwhelming
majority of the Extra Amounts back to the âcustomersâ, i.e., officials of Chinese state-
owned entities. This information was then relayed to Maxwellâs new CEO, who
immediately notified Maxwellâs audit committee and outside counsel. The Chinese

Agent soon thereafter informed Maxwell that Executive A had known and approved of
the Extra Amount arrangement throughout the relevant period. In response, Maxell
disclosed the potential FCPA issues in its Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended March
31, 2009.

24. During the relevant period, Maxwellâs controls designed to prevent illicit
payments to foreign officials were wholly inadequate. At the time, Maxwellâs Code of
Conduct contained a brief section on FCPA issues, but there is no evidence that
employees received any FCPA training prior to the companyâs remedial steps.
Maxwellâs Violations

25. Maxwell committed anti-bribery violations when its former senior
management knowingly permitted its third-party agent to make illicit payments to
officials at Chinese state-owned entities as quid pro quo for Maxwell SA contracts with
those entities. Certain former U.S. officers and senior managers of Maxwell had
knowledge of the bribes paid by Maxwell SA and its agent since at least November 2002.
Maxwell did nothing to stop these payments until questions resurfaced in late 2008 and
again in February 2009. Maxwell was headquartered in California at the time of the
illicit conduct, and some of Maxwellâs former officers and senior managers were located
in California at the time that they knowingly permitted the illicit payments. Maxwell also
routinely made use of U.S mails and interstate commerce to carry out the scheme.

26. Maxwell failed to make and keep accurate books, records, and accounts.
Many of the bribes were mischaracterized in invoices using generalized descriptions such
as âExtra Amountâ or âSpecial Arrangementâ and the improper payments were recorded
as legitimate commissions.

27. As evidenced by the extent and duration of illegal payments Maxwell made to
officials of Chinese state-owned entities through Maxwell SA, Maxwell failed to devise
and maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect illegal
payments. In addition, Maxwell (1) failed to question why the contract prices were
artificially inflated by 20% above the bid prices; (2) did not request supporting
documentation for the invoices or track where the commission payments ultimately were
distributed; (3) performed no due diligence on the agent; (4) did not require FCPA
training for all relevant employees; and (5) failed to take any action even though it
appears that certain former officers and senior managers of Maxwell had knowledge of
the bribes paid by Maxwell SA and its agent since at least November 2002.
+28. Maxwell failed to disclose that the material revenues and profits associated
with its long-standing bribery scheme enabled 'the company to enhance its financial
position until new products could be commercially developed and sold. Maxwellâs
bribery scheme generated nearly $15.4 million in high-voltage capacitor sales contracts,
from which Maxwell realized profits of over $5.6 million. These sales and profits helped
Maxwell offset losses that the company incurred to develop new products now expected
to become Maxwellâs future source of revenue growth. In addition, from 2002 through
2008, Maxwell accounted for all payments to the agent as sales commission expenses in
its financials, which Maxwell corrected in the Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended
March 31, 2009.

SEC Charges Maxwell Technologies for Long-Running
Bribery Scheme in China

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-31

Washington, D.C., Jan. 31, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged energy-related products manufacturer Maxwell Technologies
Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by repeatedly
paying bribes to government officials in China to obtain business from several
Chinese state-owned entities.

 

Additional Materials

Â» SEC Complaint
Â® Litigation Release No. 21832

 

The SEC alleges that a Maxwell subsidiary paid more than $2.5 million in
bribes to Chinese officials through a third-party sales agent from 2002 to May
2009. As a result, the subsidiary was awarded contracts that generated more
than $15 million in revenues and $5.6 million in profits for Maxwell. These
sales and profits helped Maxwell offset losses that it incurred to develop new
products now expected to become Maxwell's future source of revenue growth.

Maxwell â a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Diego â has agreed
to pay more than $6.3 million to settle the SEC's charges. In a related criminal
proceeding, Maxwell has reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of
Justice and agreed to pay an $8 million penalty.

""Maxwell's bribery allowed the company to obtain revenue and better
financially position itself until new products were commercially developed and
sold,"" said Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Unit. ""This enforcement action shows that corruption can constitute disclosure
violations as well as violations of other securities laws.""

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, Maxwell's wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary Maxwell Technologies SA
paid the bribes to officials at several Chinese state-owned entities. The bribes
were classified in invoices as either ""Extra Amount"" or ""Special Arrangement""
fees, and were made to improperly influence decisions by foreign officials to
assist Maxwell in obtaining and retaining sales contracts for high voltage
capacitors produced by Maxwell SA.

The SEC's complaint alleges that the illicit payments were made with the
knowledge and tacit approval of certain former Maxwell officials. For example,
former management at Maxwell knew of the bribery scheme in late 2002
when an employee indicated in an e-mail that a payment made in connection
with a sale in China appeared to be ""a kick-back, pay-off, bribe, whatever you
want to call it, ....in violation of US trade laws."" A U.S.-based Maxwell
executive replied that ""this is a well know[n] issue"" and he warned ""[n]o more
e-mails please.""

The SEC alleges that Maxwell failed to devise and maintain an effective
system of internal controls and improperly recorded the bribes on its books.
The illicit sales and profits from the bribery scheme helped Maxwell offset
losses that it incurred to develop its new products. Maxwell made corrections
in its Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Maxwell
consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the
company from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)
(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, orders the company to pay
$5,654,576 in disgorgement and $696,314 in prejudgment interest under a
payment plan. The company also is required to comply with certain
undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. Maxwell cooperated in
the investigation.

Tracy L. Price and James Valentino of the SEC Enforcement Division's FCPA
Unit conducted the investigation. The Commission acknowledges the
assistance of the Department of Justice's Criminal Division-Fraud Section in its
investigation, which is continuing.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
100 F Street, N.E.
Washington, DC 20549

 

Plaintiff, : C.A. No.
v.
TYSON FOODS, INC.,
2200 Don Tyson Parkway
Springdale, AR 72762
Defendant.
COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (âthe Commissionââ) alleges:
NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. The Commission brings this action based on violations by Tyson Foods, Inc.
(âTyson Foodsâ) of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAââ). During fiscal years 2004 through 2006, Tyson de
Mexico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyson Foods, made corrupt payments of more than
$100,000 to two Mexican-state veterinarians. Tyson de Mexico made the payments to the
veterinarians in order to obtain or retain business by influencing the decisions of the
veterinarians responsible for certifying Tyson de Mexico products for export under the Tipo de
Inspeccion Federal (âTIFââ) Inspection Program, an inspection program for meat-processing

facilities administered by Mexicoâs federal government. As a result of the payments, Tyson
Foods realized net profits of more than $880,000 from export sales from its Tyson de Mexico
facilities in fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006.

2. Tyson de Mexicoâs improper payments to the veterinarians were concealed by
Tyson de Mexico in the form of âsalariesâ paid to the wives of the veterinarians, even though the
wives did not perform any services for Tyson de Mexico, and through payments made pursuant
to invoices submitted by one of the veterinarians. Tyson Foods violated the anti-bribery
provisions of the FCPA because the veterinarians were Mexican government officials during the
relevant time period, Tyson Foods authorized Tyson de Mexicoâs illicit activities, and the
improper payments were made for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.

3. In connection with these improper payments, Tyson Foods failed to keep accurate
books and records and failed to have effective internal controls, as the true nature of the
payments were concealed through salary payments to phantom employees and through service
invoices submitted by one of the veterinarians. The improper payments were improperly
recorded as legitimate expenses in Tyson de Mexicoâs books and records and included in Tyson
de Mexicoâs reported financial results for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006. Tyson de Mexicoâs
financial results were, in turn, a component of Tyson Foodsâ consolidated financial statements
filed with the Commission for those years.

4. Plaintiff brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices, which violate
Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange
Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1, 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)].

5. The defendant may, unless restrained and enjoined, continue to engage in the acts

and practices set forth in this Complaint and in acts and practices of similar purport and object.
JURISDICTION

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. The Defendant made use of the
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or the facilities of a national
securities exchange in connection with the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business
alleged herein.

DEFENDANT

7. Tyson Foods, including its subsidiaries, is, and was during the relevant time
period, a global multi-industry company engaged in the production of various meat proteins and
the second-largest food production company in the Fortune 500. The Companyâs operations are
conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. The Company has
approximately 117,000 employees at more than 400 facilities and offices in the United States and
abroad. Ninety-three percent of its employees are based in the United States. The Companyâs
Chicken segment, which includes Tyson de Mexico, is primarily involved in the processing of
live chickens into fresh, frozen and value-added chicken products. The team within Tyson Foods
referred to as Tyson International sells certain products in foreign marketsâprimarily Canada,
Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Tyson Foodsâ export sales from the United States totaled $2.1 billion for each of fiscal 2004,
2005, and 2006. The principal executive offices of Tyson Foods are located in Springdale,
Arkansas. During the relevant time period, Tyson Foodsâ common stock was registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and was listed on the New York
Stock Exchange. Thus, during the relevant time period, Tyson Foods was an âissuerâ as that

term is defined in Section 3(a)(8) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78(c)(a)(8)].

3
FACTS
Background

8. Tyson Foods provides products and services to customers throughout the United
States and more than 90 countries.

9. Tyson de Mexico is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyson Foods. It is
headquartered in Gomez Palacio, Mexico and consists of three processing facilitiesâLa Citra; El
Porvenir; and La Popular. Tyson de Mexico produces protein-based and prepared food products
that comprise approximately 1% of Tyson Foodsâ total net sales. Tyson de Mexico no longer
exports products from Mexico. Tyson Foods had consolidated revenues of $26.4 billion in fiscal
year 2004, $26 billion in fiscal year 2005 and $25.6 billion in fiscal year 2006, which included
Tyson de Mexicoâs revenues of approximately $287 million in fiscal year 2004, $322 million in
fiscal year 2005 and $315 million in fiscal year 2006.

Illicit Payments to Mexican-State Veterinarians

10. In order to export products, meat-processing facilities in Mexico must obtain
certification by the TIF Programâan inspection program for meat-processing facilities
administered by Mexicoâs federal government that is supervised by an office in the Mexican
Department of Agriculture. Pursuant to the export protocols of the TIF Program, processing
facilities in Mexico are required to use state-of-the-art technologies and must adhere to the
highest sanitary standards and most advanced technological processing levels. Plant services
covered by the TIF Program include slaughtering, carcass handling, packaging, refrigerated
storage, and preparation of processed products for exports.

11. During the period of fiscal 2004 through 2006, Tyson de Mexico participated in

the official TIF Program in order to export goods to Japan and other countries. In addition, some

4
of Tyson de Mexicoâs domestic customers asked that the company have its products TIF-
certified.

12. During the relevant time period, the two veterinarians who received improper
payments served as the official TIF veterinarians at Tyson de Mexicoâs El Porvenir and La Citra
facilities. As official TIF veterinarians, their salaries were paid by the Mexican government.
Tyson de Mexico, however, made additional, improper payments of approximately $100,311 to
the veterinarians during fiscal years 2004 through 2006 on a monthly or semi-monthly basis.
The payments were made primarily to influence the decisions of the veterinarians responsible for
certifying Tyson de Mexico products for export under the TIF Program in order to obtain or
retain business for Tyson de Mexico. Some of these improper payments were concealed by
Tyson de Mexico in the form of âsalariesâ paid to the wives of the veterinarians for no-show
jobs; 1.e., the wives were included on Tyson de Mexicoâs payroll, yet they provided no services
to the company. Other payments were reflected in invoices submitted to Tyson de Mexico by
one of the veterinarians for âservices.â

Tyson Foods Learns of 'Tyson de Mexicoâs Payments But Payments Continue

13. A Tyson de Mexico plant manager discovered the wives on the payroll in June
2004 and informed a Tyson Foods accountant of the situation.

14. On July 2, 2004, certain Tyson Foods and Tyson International officials met in
Springdale, Arkansas to discuss problems with an ongoing audit of Tyson de Mexico involving
issues unrelated to the TIF veterinarians. At that meeting, a Tyson Foods accountant informed
the attendees of the improper payments to the veterinarians. At a second meeting held a few
days later, additional senior officials of Tyson Foods and Tyson International learned of the

payments to the veterinarians and their wives.
15. During a July 7, 2004 meeting held in Springdale, Arkansas, senior management
of Tyson Foods and Tyson International agreed that Tyson de Mexico should cease making the
payroll payments to the wives. At this meeting, senior management of Tyson Foods and Tyson
International also discussed whether and how the companies could continue paying the
veterinarians legally. Three participants were tasked with looking into the matter more closely.

16. In mid July of 2004, a Tyson International official communicated with a senior
officer of Tyson Foods concerning the improper payments to the TIF veterinarians.

17. On or around July 29, 2004, two officers of Tyson International and others met in
Mexico to discuss the payments to the TIF veterinarians. In the meeting, the participants
discussed replacing the payroll payments to the veterinariansâ wives with invoice payments to
one of the veterinarians. An executive of Tyson International approved this approach.

18. The wives remained on Tyson de Mexicoâs payroll through August 2004 when an
executive of Tyson International instructed a manager at Tyson de Mexicoâs facilities to remove
the wives from the payroll. Accordingly, on or around August 27, 2004, a Tyson de Mexico
employee in human resources sent an email to an accountant at Tyson de Mexico with an
attachment stating, in part, â2.-TIF-BOTH PERSONS WILL BE PULLED OUT OF THE
PAYROLL ON AUGUST 31. EQUIVALENT PAYMENT WILL BE ADDED TO THE
INVOICE OF ONE OF THEM ISSUE [sic] EVERY MONTH. THE NEW PAYMENT WITH
INVOICE WILL BE THE ONLY ONE AND WILL BE $30,700 PS/MTH.â

19. In or around August 2004, consistent with the August 27, 2004 e-mail, the amount
of the service invoices submitted by one of the veterinarians increased dramatically, from

approximately $1,200 per month to $2,700 per month. The Tyson de Mexico general manager
indicated that the increase in invoice payments was the sum of the wivesâ salary and the money
they would need to buy health insurance.

20. Tyson de Mexico continued to pay the service invoices in order to obtain or retain
business by influencing the decisions of the veterinarians responsible for certifying Tyson de
Mexico products for export under the TIF Program. Finally, two years later in the fall of 2006,
counsel for Tyson Foods instructed Tyson de Mexico to cease making the invoice payments to
the veterinarian.

21. Tyson Foods violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA because the
veterinarians were Mexican government officials during the relevant time period and Tyson
Foods authorized Tyson de Mexicoâs illicit activities. These improper payments were made for
the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In connection with these improper payments,
Tyson Foods failed to keep accurate books and records and failed to have effective internal
controls, as the true nature of the payments were concealed through salary payments to the
veterinarianâs wives and through service invoices submitted by one of the veterinarians. These
corrupting payments were improperly recorded as legitimate expenses in Tyson de Mexicoâs
books and records and included in Tyson de Mexicoâs reported financial results for fiscal years
2004, 2005 and 2006. Tyson de Mexicoâs financial results were, in turn, a component of Tyson
Foodsâ consolidated financial statements filed with the Commission for those years.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

23. As set forth more fully above, Tyson Foods violated the anti-bribery provisions of
the FCPA when it authorized illicit payments by its subsidiary which corruptly made payments
to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing their acts or decisions in their official capacity,
inducing them to do or omit to do actions in violation of their lawful duties, securing an improper
advantage, or inducing such foreign officials to use their influence with a foreign government or

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].

THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act

28. Paragraphs | through 21 above are realleged and incorporated by reference

were recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles; and (11) payments were recorded as necessary to maintain
accountability for its assets.

30. As a result of the foregoing, Tyson Foods violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

SEC Charges Tyson Foods with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-42

Washington, D.C., Feb. 10, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged Tyson Foods Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) by making illicit payments to two Mexican government
veterinarians responsible for certifying its Mexican subsidiaryâs chicken
products for export sales.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 21851
Â» SEC Complaint

 

The SEC alleges that Tyson de Mexico initially concealed the improper
payments by putting the veterinariansâ wives on its payroll while they
performed no services for the company. The wives were later removed from
the payroll and payments were then reflected in invoices submitted to Tyson
de Mexico by one of the veterinarians for âservices.â Tyson de Mexico paid
the veterinarians a total of $100,311. It was not until two years after Tyson
Foods officials first learned about the subsidiaryâs illicit payments that its
counsel instructed Tyson de Mexico to cease making the payments.

Tyson Foods agreed to pay more than $5 million to settle the SECâs charges
and resolve related criminal proceedings announced today by the Department
of Justice.

âTyson and its subsidiary committed core FCPA violations by bribing
government officials through no-show jobs and phony invoices, and by having
a lax system of internal controls that failed to detect or prevent the
misconduct,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of
Enforcement.

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in the District of
Columbia, the scheme occurred during fiscal years 2004 to 2006. In order to
export products, meat-processing facilities in Mexico must obtain certification
through an inspection program administered by Mexicoâs federal government
and supervised by an office in the Mexican Department of Agriculture. Tyson
de Mexico participated in the program in order to export goods to Japan and
other countries. The two veterinarians involved were responsible for certifying
Tyson de Mexicoâs chicken products for export and served as official Mexican
government veterinarians at Tyson de Mexicoâs facilities.

The SECâs complaint alleges that a Tyson de Mexico plant manager
discovered the wives on the payroll in June 2004 and informed a Tyson Foods
accountant of the situation. After subsequent meetings involving Tyson Foods
and Tyson International officials, the payroll payments to the veterinariansâ
wives were replaced with invoice payments to one of the veterinarians. An
executive of Tyson International approved this approach.

The SEC alleges that in connection with these improper payments, Tyson
Foods failed to keep accurate books and records and failed to implement a
system of effective internal controls to prevent the salary payments to
phantom employees and the payment of illicit invoices. The improper
payments were improperly recorded as legitimate expenses in Tyson de
Mexicoâs books and records and included in Tyson de Mexicoâs reported
financial results for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006. Tyson de Mexicoâs
financial results were, in turn, a component of Tyson Foodsâ consolidated
financial statements filed with the SEC for those years.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Tyson Foods consented to
the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement plus pre-judgment
interest of more than $1.2 million and permanently enjoining it from violating
the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the
FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval.

In a related criminal information filed today, the Department of Justice
charged Tyson Foods with conspiring to violate the FCPA and violating the
FCPA. DOJ and Tyson Foods agreed to resolve the charges by entering into a
deferred prosecution agreement. Tyson Foods has agreed to pay a $4 million
criminal penalty.

The SECâs case was investigated by Allen Flood and Conway Dodge of the
SECâs Division of Enforcement. The SEC acknowledges the cooperation of
Tyson Foods in the investigation. The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the
assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

COMPLAINT .

Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY

I. This matter concerns violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(""FCPA"") by Johnson & Johnson (âJ&Jââ) as a result of the acts of its subsidiaries to
obtain business for J&Jâs medical device and pharmaceutical segments.

2. Since at least 1998 and continuing to early 2006, J&Jâs subsidiaries,
employees and agents paid bribes to public doctors in Greece who selected J&J surgical
implants for their patients. Further, J&Jâs subsidiaries and agents paid bribes to doctors
and public hospital administrators in Poland who awarded tenders to J&J from 2000 to
2006. J&Jâs subsidiaries and agents also paid bribes to public doctors in Romania to

prescribe J&J pharmaceutical products from 2002 to 2007. Finally, J&Jâs subsidiaries
and agent paid kickbacks to Iraq in order to obtain contracts under the United Nations Oil

â

for Food Program (âProgramâ) from 2000 to 2003. \
3. J&J violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] by making illicit payments to foreign
government officials in order to obtain or retain business. J&J violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have an adequate internal control system in
place to detect and prevent the illicit payments. J&J violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the

Exchange Act by improperly recording each of those payments in its accounting books

and records.
JURISDICTION
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),

and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. J&J, directly or
indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the
mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

5. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(0).

14. The financial results of each of the above J&J entities were a component

FACTS
A. Greece

15. One of J&Jâs product lines is surgical implants such as artificial knees,
hips and other products that surgeons implant into patients. Surgical implants are a
lucrative, but competitive business. In many countries, orthopedic surgeons control
which implants they use.

16. In 1998, J&J acquired another medical device company, DePuy Inc., a
NYSE company. A top DePuy executive then went on to become a top J&J executive in
the United States in J&Jâs medical device and diagnostics business (âExecutive Aâ). At
the time of the acquisition, DePuy was engaged in a widespread bribery scheme in
Greece to sell its implants. Executive A and DPI executives knowingly continued that
scheme. From 1998 to 2006, J&J earned $24,258,072 in profits on sales obtained

through bribery.
1. Pre-J&J Bribery Scheme :
ee

17. In 1997, DPI, a subsidiary of DePuy, hired a Greek individyal (thÃ© âGreek
Agentâ) to sell orthopedic implants in Greece. The Greek Agent was well-known in the
Greek orthopedic industry with long-standing relationships with surgeons.

18. | DPI executed two contracts to memorialize the deal. In September 1997,
DPI hired the Greek Agentâs Greek company (the âGreek Distributorâ) as its exclusive
sales agent. Under that deal, the Greek Distributor agreed to market DePuy products in
Greece and to pay DPI for products that it re-sold primarily to public hospitals. A month
later, DPI signed a separate contract with a private company in the Isle of Man (the
âPrivate Companyâ) owned by the Greek Agent in which DPI agreed to pay the Private
Company a 25% commission on everything that the Greek Distributor purchased. DPI
paid the commission in the Isle of Man.

19. The second contract said that the Private Company would provide
marketing support to the Greek Distributor and DPI. In fact, the contracts were a sham
engineered to facilitate bribery. DPI inflated the price it charged the Greek Distributor,
then paid that âcommissionâ to the Private Company. The Private Company did not
provide any significant services to DPI. The Greek Agent used the commissions â which
were raised to 35% by 1998 â to bribe publicly-employed doctors to use DePuy implants.

2. J&J Acquires DePuy And The Bribery Scheme Continues

20. On November 5, 1998, J&I acquired DePuy. As a result, J&Jâs Policy on
Business Conduct (the âPBCâ) became effective over the DePuy organization. The PBC
prohibited the payment of bribes, required accurate books and records, and dictated

controls over payments to third parties.
21. After the merger, Executive A and DPI executives:aware of the bribes

%
a

continued the relationship with the Greek Agent. \

22. Beyond the DPI executives who knew about the payments to doctors,
other DPI employees were aware of allegations that Greek doctors requested bribes as a
means to supplement their public salaries. They were also aware that the Greek Agent
had crucial relationships with Greek doctors and that those relationships were necessary
in order to sell implants.

23. After the merger, J&J executives learned that the Greek Agent was being
paid through a private company in the Isle of Man. Those payments violated the PBCâs
policy requiring all agent payments be made in the country where the product was sold,
i.e., in Greece. DPI executives were particularly concerned that the payments made out
of country would raise red flags of bribery.

24. By April 1999, certain J&J executives decided to stop the payments to the
Private Company in the Isle of Man over the objections of Executive A. The DPI
executives and others discussed the need to continue to funnel money to the Greek Agent
for doctors that was equivalent to the Private Companyâs prior 35% âcommission.â For
example,

Â¢ Ina March 22, 1999 e-mail, an executive at J&Jâs existing operating
company in Greece, J&J Medical Helles, cautioned his supervisor that the
Greek Agent had âmanaged over the year to build off-shore accounts
through various representations he has, which in turn helped him to have
significant competitive advantage when dealing with Greek surgeons.â
The e-mail detailed instances that the executive characterized as âtruly but
a fewâ of the payments to Greek surgeons, including educational support.

eÂ¢ Ina June 24, 1999 letter, a DPI attorney objected to a draft contract with
the Greek Distributor because the 35% commission appeared to be a

âbonus payment.â Ina letter sent to a DPI executive and copied to a J&J
in-house counsel, the attorney said that the Greek Distributor was already
required to market DePuy products, and he warned that the executive who
had drafted the arrangement could not explain how the money would be
used to increase market share. \ .

e Ina March 13, 2000 status report, a DPI executive wrote that DPI planned
to âpay a 30% sales commission to [the Greek Agent] (or a nominee
company of his choice)â and that the Greek Agent âwould take his
personal remuneration and any other local support payments that he
needed from this sum.â

25.  Inor about January 2000, the two DPI executives who dealt most-closely
with the Greek business met with DPIâs President and recommended that DPI terminate
the Greek Agent because of the bribery. The DPI President raised the issue with his
superior, Executive A, in late January 2000 during J&Jâs international sales conference.

26. At the conference, three DPI executives met with Executive A, told him
about the bribery, and recommended that DPI terminate the relationship with the Greek
Distributor. However, the next day, Executive A and DPIâs President met with
representatives of the Greek Agent. Executive A offered to buy the Greek Distributor
and to retain the Greek Agent as a consultant.

27.  Inasubsequent e-mail, Executive A explained that DPI had considered
terminating the Greek Distributor, but â[t]he only problem with the proposal was that we
would lose half our business even by year 3.â Executive A stated that â[t]o lose
approximately $4m in sales in end user terms to the competition is totally unacceptable.â
Executive A added that two DPI executives who worked for him were âtrying to find an
alternative solution in order for us to acquire the [Greek Distributor] business retaining
the sales and handling the in market customer practices.â

28. The DPI executives then met with the Greek Agent to discuss their future

business arrangements. Executive A initially tried to reinstitute the payments in the Isle
of Man, but after a J&J attorney objected, Executive A allowed DPI to acquire the Greek
a
Distributor instead. \

29. In April 2000, a J&J executive based in Europe sent an e-mail to
Executive A noting that J&J took on risks by buying an existing company (as opposed to
just assets), but saying that the Isle of Man commission payments had been unacceptably
linked to the purchases of DePuy products by the Greek Distributor:

The problem with these contracts for offshore payments has been and
continues to be the âsmell testâ or the issue of substance plus our
knowledge of what really happens. In the case of [the Greek Distributor],
we (or them) would face serious problems to come up with a substantiated
services rendered for anything close to the amount paid (including mark-
up), simply because only a small fraction (if any) is used for services and
the bulk goes into the black hole. The last item is my major concern for
the latest option i.e. buying [the Greek Distributor] since, even with a
thorough audit, we cannot know whether we will face future tax (and
other) audits linking [the Greek Distributor], the owners and the Isle of
Man payments. By virtue of the previous contract, all three parties are
linked and subject to potential liabilities.

30. Through 2000, DPI followed Executive Aâs instructions and negotiated to
buy the Greek Distributor. Those negotiations raised more red flags of bribery. In
November 2000, a DPI lawyer and a DPI accountant circulated a draft due diligence
report saying that they had not seen evidence of bribery in the Greek Distributorâs books
and.could not determine whether the Greek Distributor engaged in these practices.
However, on the same day, the Greek Distributorâs outside accountant e-mailed the DPI
financial executive that the Greek Distributorâs inventory was overvalued by 35% and
would have to be adjusted after DPIâs acquisition when the inventory was valued and

rolled up to J&Jâs books and records. The e-mail noted that the Greek Distributor had

paid inflated prices to fund the payments to the Private Company and to cover âcash
incentivesâ that the Greek Agent paid. The e-mail alerted the DPI accountant to the

aâ

bribery, but he never changed his due diligence report. 4
31. In fact, several DPI executives knew that âcash incentivesâ were not
proper and that they were really bribes to doctors. After the Greek Distributorâs
accountant sent a memo that noted that the Greek Agent needed money as soon as
possible because he had to âpay cash incentives for sales up to the end of January 2001,â
a DPI vice president scolded him for mentioning the payments in writing:
I [am] very disappointed to read in your proposal that it contains
references to [the Greek Agentâs] activities which cannot be mentioned in
written correspondence with DePuy International. I have made this point
many times and each time it happens you put us in a very difficult
position.
3. Further Attempts To Conceal the Illicit Payments
32.  J&J finally closed DPIâs acquisition of the Greek Distributor in January
2001 and eventually renamed it DePuy Helles. The Greek Agentâs associate became the
head of DePuy Helles. Rather than sever its ties to the Greek Agent, DePuy Helles
continued to use him to facilitate bribe payments.
33. DePuy Helles entered a consultant agreement, which paid the Greek Agent
27% of all sales in Greece. However, in Spring 2001, DPIâs outside accountants
questioned the amount of the payments for tax reasons. To conceal the true purpose and
amount of payments subsequently made to the Greek Agent, the DPI executives split the
payments between two new agreements with some payments paid by DPI and others paid
by DePuy Helles.

34. The bribe payments to doctors continued, and the Greek Agent and DPI

executives often referred to them as âprofessional educationâ or âsupport.â The Greek
Agent wrote to DPI that âcash incentives to surgeons is common knowledge in Greeceâ
and included charts that explicitly said the Greek Agent would be paid so that he could
pay âsupportâ to surgeons. At one point, a DPI vice president e-mailed the head of
DePuy Helles about a possible increase in payments to the Greek Agent âfor increased
direct payments to the surgeons.â

35. In October 2003, DPI dismissed the Greek Agent after months of disputes
about the sales of surgical implants in Greece. DPI hired another agent to fill the same
role in the bribery scheme.

36. In January 2005, a new EUCOMED Code of Business Practice went into
effect, and a DPI vice president wrote the head of DePuy Helles and his supervisor:

âEveryone in the industry is a million miles from applying the letter or
spirit of the EUCOMED code! Most industry players break every single
tule in the book (support spouse travel, give non-medical gifts, etc.). If we
applied the letter and intent of the guidelines today, we'd lose 95% of our
business by the end of the year.â

37. Throughout this tite period, the Greek Agent and his replacement were
occasionally late in paying doctors. In those instances, DePuy Helles employees
withdrew petty cash and paid the doctors directly. From 2002 to 2006, records show
about $590,000 in large, round-number withdrawals booked as âmiscellaneous.â Those
amounts were generally re-deposited to petty cash within days and were booked as
ârepayments.â

38.  J&Jâs internal audit group discovered the payments to Greek doctors in
early 2006 after receiving a whistleblower complaint. The issue of payments to surgeons

had been previously raised in an anonymous 2003 letter to a different internal audit team

concerning a related J&J subsidiary in Greece. However, that team concentrated their

10
investigation on allegations about a possible conflict of interest by local management and

did not fully investigate the alleged payments to doctors. \\

B. Poland

39. Employees of MD&D Poland, a J&J subsidiary, bribed publicly-employed
doctors and hospital administrators to obtain business. MD&D Poland executives
running three business lines oversaw the creation of sham contracts and travel documents
and also the creation of slush funds as a means to funnel bribe payments to doctors and
administrators. From 2000 to 2006, J&J earned $4,348,000 in profit from its sales
through the bribery.

40. The bribery appears 1 have stopped when Polish prosecutors began to
investigate payments to doctors.

1. Sham Civil Contracts

 

4]. MD&D Poland created sham civil contracts with publicly-employed
doctors and hospital administrators to pay them for using 1&3 *s medical devices or for
influencing hospitals to award medical device tenders to MD&D Poland. Although the
contracts called for services, the doctors would not provide any, and MD&D Poland
would pay the doctors based on fictitious activities.

- 42. Approximately $775,000 of improper civil contract payments were
funneled to public doctors from at least January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2006. In some cases,
the amount paid to the doctor was a percentage of the value of a hospital tender. In |
others, the amount was a flat fee requested by the doctor or hospital administrator.

43. | The payments to doctors were bribes to obtain and retain J&J business.

For example, a MD&D Poland employee sent an e-mail asking for the approval of a sham

11
civil contract with a hospitalâs healthcare director, noting that the doctor was âthe key
decision maker in the sutures tender for 2002, which will be concluded sodn.â Similar e-
mails accompanied other sham civil contracts as the basis for seeking approval for the
sham arrangements by business managers.

44. | MD&D Poland had no internal controls in place that would have required
supporting documentation be provided prior to making the payments to the doctors. At
least one high-level business manager and another executive in Poland were aware of and
approved the illicit payments.

2. False Travel Invoices

45. | MD&D Poland also paid for public doctors and hospital administrators to
travel to medical conventions in Poland and abroad in order to influence tender
committee decisions in their favor. Sponsored doctors were taken on trips in exchange
for influencing the doctorsâ decisions to purchase J&Jâs medical products or to award
hospital tenders to J&J. Some of the trips were to the United States for conferences.
Some of the trips were to tourists areas in Europe, and some included spouses and family
members to what amounted to vacations.

46. Business managers were allowed to approve lesser amounts for trips, but
larger trips were approved by a managing director â all with an understanding that these
expenditures were for the benefit of doctors who would influence tenders in MD&D
Polandâs favor.

47. . MD&D Poland employees also faked travel expenses in order to generate
cash. The money was then funneled to doctors as bribe payments. For example, two

MD&D franchises used a particular travel agency to funnel money to a senior Poland

12,
Ministry of Health official with significant influence over a hospital. A Business manager
directed his subordinates to submit approximately $147,000 in false travel\invoices,
which presumably was used to bribe doctors. MD&D Poland spent approximately $7.6
million on these travel sponsorships between 2000 and 2006 that were rolled into the
books of J&J with an indeterminate amount as bribes due to insufficient records.

Cc. Romania

48. Employees of J&J d.o.o. (âPharma Romaniaâ), a J&J subsidiary, bribed
publicly-employed doctors and pharmacists to prescribe J&J products that the company
was actively promoting (the âPromoted Productsâ). The employees worked with Pharma
Romaniaâs local distributors to deliver cash to publicly-employed doctors who ordered
J&J drugs for their patients. Pharma Romania also provided travel to certain doctors who
agreed to prescribe J&J products. From 2000 to 2007, J&J earned $3,515,500 in profit
from its sales through the bribery.

49. Pharma Romania used local distributors to sell J&J products to doctors
and pharmacies in Romania. Pharma Romania sales representatives worked with the
distributors to generate cash that was paid to the doctors in exchange for the doctors
prescribing Promoted Products. The distributors obtained the cash to pay the doctors by
receiving discounts on each invoice or by receiving free goods that the distributors could
sell for profit to obtain extra cash. Pharma Romania employees or the distributors would
then deliver the cash to the doctors that were equal to 3-5% of the cost of the drugs that
they prescribed. The distributors would then work with the doctors and pharmacies to

deliver the drugs to patients and receive payment for the drugs from the Romanian

government insurance program.

13
50. The scheme using travel benefits apparently began in late 2007 after J&Jâs
internal audit began investigating claims of cash payments to doctors. Pharma Romania |
employees stopped paying cash to doctors and began offering the doctors trips to medical
congresses in return for the doctors prescribing Promoted Products. In some cases,
Pharma Romania employees had J&Jâs travel agents overcharge Pharma Romania for the
trips in order to generate cash to pay for the doctorsâ families to attend the trips as
vacations or to provide the doctors with âpocket moneyâ while on the trips.

D. âOil For Foodâ Transactions

51. The Oil for Food Program (the âProgramâ) was intended to provide
humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under the
international trade sanctions that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Program
permitted the Iraqi government to sell its crude oil and use the proceeds to purchase food,
medicine, and critical infrastructure supplies.

52. The proceeds of the oil sales were transferred directly from the buyers to
an escrow account (the âU.N. Escrow Accountâ) maintained in New York by the United
Nations 661 Committee. Funds in the U.N. Escrow Account were available for the
purchase of humanitarian supplies, subject to U.N. approval and supervision. The intent
of this structure was to prevent the proceeds of Jraqâs crude oil sales from undermining
the sanctions regime by supplying cash to Saddam Hussein.

53. Corruption was rampant within the Program. By mid-2000, Iraqi
ministries on the instruction of top government officials instituted a policy requiring |
suppliers of humanitarian goods to pay a ten percent kickback on each contract. This

kickback requirement was euphemistically referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee;

14
however, no services were provided. Suppliers competing to obtain contracts under the

x
Â®

Program were encouraged to include a ten percent markup in their bids or \purchase
orders.

54. The inflated contract prices were incorporated into the Oil for Food
contracts as a way to permit the suppliers to recover from the U.N. Escrow Account the
kickback payments they had paid secretly to Iraq. Following the 2004 release of a report
by the U.S. General Accounting Office exposing some of the abuses, the U.N.
commissioned an independent inquiry committee, headed by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker (the âVolcker Committeeâ), to investigate the Programâs
performance. That committeeâs October 27, 2005, final report estimated that the Iraqi
government had diverted $1.7 billion in illicit income from the Program.

55.  J&J participated in the Program through two of its subsidiaries, Cilag AG
International and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectively âJanssen-Cilagâ). During the
program, Janssen-Cilag sold pharmaceuticals to an arm of the Iraqi Ministry of Health
known as Kimadia. Janssen-Cilag conducted business with Kimadia in Iraq through a
Lebanese agent (the âAgentâ). The Agentâs primary contact with the J&J companies was
an area director at Janssen-Cilagâs office in Lebanon:

56. Prior to the time that Iraqi ministries began demanding kickbacks, the
Agent received a twelve percent commission on sales in Iraq. In February 2001, several
months after Kimadia started demanding kickbacks, Janssen-Cilag signed âside lettersâ
with the Agent that raised his commissions on sales in Iraq by ten percent to twenty-two

percent.

1S
57. The increase in the Agentâs commissions was approved by a Janssen-Cilag
at

area director in Lebanon as well as a managing director for Janssen-Cilagâs Middle East
West Asia (âMEWAâ) group in Belgium. The stated reason for the increase was so that
the Agent could conduct âpromotional activitiesâ in Iraq. This commission increase
allowed the Agent on behalf of Janssen-Cilag to pay the required ten percent kickbacks to
the Iraqi ministries through the Agent and to mask the payments as legitimate agent
commissions in the companiesâ books and records. Notably, the Agent was not able to
provide detailed evidence or description of the purported promotional activities
undertaken with his increased commissions, nor did the Company require such
documentation.

58. Following the March 2003 invasion of Iraq and the end of Kimadiaâs
kickback demands, Janssen-Cilag no longer needed to pay extra commissions to the
Agent to be used as kickbacks. Accordingly, Janssen-Cilag re-negotiated the
commissions, decreasing them by ten percent. As with the prior change in commissions,
the decrease was approved by a Janssen-Cilag area manager in Lebanon and a managing
director in Janssen-Cilagâs MEWA group. The Agentâs contract with Janssen-Cilag was
terminated once the scheme was uncovered.

59. In total, secret kickback payments of approximately $857,387 were made
in connection with nineteen Oil for Food contracts. The payments were made through
the Agent to Iraqi controlled accounts in order to avoid detection by the U.N. The fee
was effectively a bribe paid to the Iraqi regime, which were disguised on J&Jâs books and

records by mischaracterizing the bribes as legitimate commissions.

16
60.  Inorder to generate funds to pay the bribes and to conceal those payments,
Janssen-Cilag and its agent inflated the price of the contracts by at least ten percent
before submitting them to the U.N. for approval. J&Jâs total profits on the contracts were
$6,106,255.

E. Anti-Bribery Violations

61. J&J, through its subsidiaries and agents, knowingly allowed its employees
and third parties to pay Greek and Polish public doctors and public hospital
administrators for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.

62. Executive A, a U.S. resident and a senior executive at J&J, approved the
arrangements with the Greek Agent in Greece. Executive A and DPI executives knew
that the Greek Agent was bribing Greek doctors. In addition, Polish doctors were bribed
to use J&J products in return for trips. Use of the mails and interstate commerce was also
used to facilitate the bribery schemes in both Greece and Poland.

F. Failure To Maintain Its Books and Records

63.  J&Jâs subsidiaries made numerous illicit payments for the purpose of
obtaining contracts in Iraq, Romania, Greece, and Poland. J&Jâs books and records did
not reflect the true nature of those payments. For example, they did not record that that a
portion of its payments to the Greek and Iraqi agents constituted reimbursements for
bribes, and they did not record the true terms of the civil contract payments to Polish
doctors. Efforts were made to obscure the purpose of trips to the United States and
abroad. Certain J&J subsidiaries created false contracts, invoices, and other documents

â to conceal the true business arrangement it had with its consultants and distributors to pay

17
bribes. False travel documents were created, and petty cash was used to pay bribes.
im

United Nations contracts were also falsified. \
G. Failure To Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

64.  J&J failed to implement internal controls to detect or prevent bribery. The
conduct was widespread in various markets, Greece, Poland, Romania, and Iraq. The
conduct involved employees and managers of all levels. False documents were routinely
created to conceal the bribery in each country.

65. Rather than cease the bribery that was happening at DePuy prior to J&Jâs
acquisition, J&J through its subsidiaries, employees and agents allowed the bribery to
continue. They created sham businesses and entered into contracts that were merely
conduits to allow the bribery to flourish. They failed to conduct due diligence on the
Greek Distributor. The Company also paid its consultant outside of Greece to avoid
detection of bribery. The Company had two different J&J corporate entities make
payments to the Greek Agent to conceal the amount of money that was being funneled to
doctors as bribes.

66. | MD&D Poland entered into fake civil contracts with Polish doctors and
J&I also created false travel arrangements in Poland and Romania to âcreate slush funds.

67. Cilag and Janssen paid bribes to Iraq despite the fact that trade sanctions
were in place against doing business in Iraq. Cilag and Janssen falsified their contracts

with the United Nations to conceal the kickbacks being paid to Iraq.

SEC Charges Johnson & Johnson With Foreign Bribery

J&J to Pay $70 Million to Settle Cases Brought by SEC and Criminal
Authorities

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-87

Washington, D.C., April 7, 2011 - The Securities and Exchange Commission

today charged Johnson and Johnson (J&J) with violating the Foreign Corrupt

Practices Act (FCPA) by bribing public doctors in several European countries
and paying kickbacks to Iraq to illegally obtain business.

The SEC alleges that since at least 1998, subsidiaries of the New Brunswick,
N.J.-based pharmaceutical, consumer product, and medical device company
paid bribes to public doctors in Greece who selected J&J surgical implants,
public doctors and hospital administrators in Poland who awarded contracts to
J&J, and public doctors in Romania to prescribe J&| pharmaceutical products.
J&J subsidiaries also paid kickbacks to Iraq to obtain 19 contracts under the
United Nations Oil for Food Program.

 

Additional Materials

Â» SEC Complaint
Â» Litigation Release No. 21922

 

J&J agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying more than $48.6 million in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest. J&J also agreed to pay a $21.4
million fine to settle parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) today. A resolution of a related investigation by
the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office is anticipated.

âThe message in this and the SECâs other FCPA cases is plain - any
competitive advantage gained through corruption is a mirage,â said Robert
Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. âJ&J chose profit
margins over compliance with the law by acquiring a private company for the
purpose of paying bribes, and using sham contracts, off-shore companies, and
slush funds to cover its tracks.â

Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act Unit, added, âBribes to public doctors can have a detrimental
effect on the public health care systems that potentially pay more for
products procured through greed and corruption.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in the District of
Columbia, public doctors and administrators in Greece, Poland, and Romania
who ordered or prescribed J&J products were rewarded in a variety of ways,
including with cash and inappropriate travel. J&J subsidiaries, employees and
agents used slush funds, sham civil contracts with doctors, and off-shore
companies in the Isle of Man to carry out the bribery.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, J&J has consented to the
entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of
Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934; ordering it to pay $38,227,826 in disgorgement and $10,438,490 in
prejudgment interest; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings
regarding its FCPA compliance program. J&J voluntarily disclosed some of the
violations by its employees and conducted a thorough internal investigation
to determine the scope of the bribery and other violations, including proactive
investigations in more than a dozen countries by both its internal auditors and
outside counsel. J&Jâs internal investigation and its ongoing compliance
programs were essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of J&Jâs
FCPA violations.

Kelly G. Kilroy and Tracy L. Price of the Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit and
Brent S. Mitchell and Reid A. Muoio conducted the SECâs investigation. The
SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud
Section; Federal Bureau of Investigation; Serious Fraud Office in the United
Kingdom; and 5th Investigation Department of the Regional Prosecutor's
Office in Radom, Poland. The SEC's investigation is continuing.

COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionââ) alleges as follows:

SUMMARY

1. This matter involves violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by Defendant Orthofix International
N.V. (âOrthofixââ), an orthopedic medical device company. From 2003 to 2010, Orthofixâs
wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Promeca S.A. de C.V. (âPromecaââ), repeatedly paid bribes
totaling approximately 317,000 to Mexican officials in order to obtain and retain sales contracts
from Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (âIMSSâ), the Mexican government-owned
healthcare and social services institution. Promeca employees referred to these payments as
âchocolates.â

2. These improper payments, falsely recorded on the companyâs books as cash
advances to Promeca executives or training and promotions expenses, generated approximately

$8.7 million in gross revenues for Orthofix and resulted in illicit net profits of about $4.9 million.
3. Orthofix violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) by failing to accurately record these improper payments on its books and
records. Orthofix violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to maintain an

adequate system of internal accounting controls to detect and prevent the illicit payments.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d) and 78aa]. Defendant Orthofixâs common stock is
traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and Orthofix has, directly or indirectly, made use of
the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a
national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses of
business alleged in this Complaint.

5. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa], because Orthofixâs corporate administrative offices are located in Lewisville,
Texas.

DEFENDANT

6. Orthofix International N.V. is a limited liability company formed under the laws

 

of Netherlands Antilles. Its corporate administrative offices are located in Lewisville, Texas.
Orthofixâs common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act and is traded on the Nasdag Global Select Market under the symbol âOFIX.â

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

7. Promeca S.A. de C.V. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orthofix headquartered in

 

Mexico City, Mexico.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

Background

8. Orthofix is an orthopedic medical device company that provides surgical and non-
surgical medical products for various market sectors, such as spine, orthopedics, and sports
medicine. The company distributes its products both domestically in the United States and
internationally in multiple countries.

9. During 2003 to 2010, Promeca, Orthofixâs wholly-owned subsidiary based in
Mexico City, sold Orthofixâs products to government and private hospitals in Mexico.
Approximately 60% of Promecaâs revenues came from IMSS, the Mexican government-owned
medical care and social services provider.

10. During the relevant time, Promeca was subject to Orthofixâs control, including
the implementation of internal controls at Promeca. Additionally, the financial results of
Promeca were a component of the consolidated financial statements included in Orthofixâs
filings with the Commission.

The Bribery Scheme

11. From at least 2003 to 2007, Orthofixâs subsidiary, Promeca, regularly paid bribes
to IMSS hospital employees in the form of cash and/or gifts, in order to secure sales contracts
from IMSS hospitals.

12. The bribe amounts, referred to internally at Promeca as âchocolates,â ranged from
5% to 10% of the collected sales for the hospital in question.

13. In order to obtain cash for the illicit payments, Promeca executives wrote checks
to themselves, which they justified as cash advances.

14. They later submitted falsified receipts for imaginary expenses including meals

and new car tires, which were accounted for in Promecaâs books and records. As the bribes

3
increased, it became difficult for Promeca executives to invent new receipts to justify the
advances. Eventually, the bribes became too large, forcing the Promeca executives to devise
another justification methodology, and hence they began falsely accounting for the payments as
promotional and training expenses.

15. Because of the bribery scheme, Promecaâs training and promotional expenses
were significantly over budget. In one instance, Orthofix launched an inquiry into these
expenses, but did not control them.

16. In 2008, IMSS began purchasing medical products under a new national tender
system, where a special IMSS committee, rather than the individual hospitals, selected the
winning bidder who would cover IMSS nationally. Promeca then established a new system of
bribery to ensure that it was awarded the business under the national tender system. To achieve
this, Promeca made payments to three front companies, which were controlled by certain IMSS
officials. Promeca won the national tenders for 2008 and 2009 and paid the front companies 5%
and 3%, respectively, of the collected sales from those tenders. The front companies concealed
these bribes by submitting false invoices, characterizing them as training and other promotional
expenses that Promeca never received. Promeca falsely recorded the bribes on its books as
payments for training courses, meetings and congresses, and promotional costs.

17. In addition, between 2003 and 2010, Promeca expended approximately $80,050
on gifts and travel packages, some of which were intended to corruptly influence IMSS
employees in order to retain their business. The various gifts included vacation packages,
televisions, laptops, appliances, and in one case, the lease of a Volkswagen Jetta. These
payments were falsely accounted for in Promecaâs books and records as promotional and training

expenses.
18. In all, the improper payments, totaling about $317,000, generated approximately
$8.7 million in gross revenues and resulted in illicit net profits to Orthofix of about $4.9 million.

Orthofixâs Remedial Measures to Prevent Corrupt Payments

19. Prior to the discovery of the bribery schemes, Orthofix did not have an effective
FCPA compliance policy or FCPA-related training.

20. Although Orthofix disseminated some code of ethics and anti-bribery training to
Promeca, the materials were only in English, and it was unlikely that Promeca employees
understood them as most Promeca employees spoke minimal English.

21. Additionally, even though Promecaâs training and promotional expenses, that
included the improper payments, were often over budget, Orthofix did very little to investigate or
diminish the excessive spending.

22. Upon discovery of the bribe payments through a Promeca executive, Orthofix
immediately self-reported the matter to the Commission staff, and conducted an internal
investigation.

23. Orthofix also implemented significant remedial measures. Specifically, it
terminated the Promeca executives that orchestrated the bribery scheme, wound up Promecaâs
operations, enhanced its overall FCPA compliance program with mandatory annual FCPA
training for all employees and third-party agents, expanded internal audit functions, and
implemented other internal control measures.

Orthofixâs Violations

24. Orthofixâs subsidiary characterized their payments to IMSS as cash advances or
training and promotional expenses even though those payments were used as bribes. Orthofixâs

books and records did not reflect the true nature of those payments.
25. Orthofix failed to implement adequate internal controls to prevent the bribery or
to ensure that transaction were properly recorded. Orthofix failed to implement an FCPA
compliance and training program commensurate with the extent of its international operations
and particularly its ownership of Promeca, a subsidiary that had substantial sales to government-
owned enterprises. Further, even though Orthofix knew that Promecaâs training and promotional
expenses were often over budget, it did nothing to act on the red flag.

SEC Charges Orthofix International With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-133

Washington, D.C., July 10, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Texas-based medical device company Orthofix
International N.V. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when a subsidiary paid routine bribes referred to as âchocolatesâ to
Mexican officials in order to obtain lucrative sales contracts with government hospitals.

The SEC alleges that Orthofixâs Mexican subsidiary Promeca S.A. de C.V. bribed officials at Mexicoâs government-owned health care and social
services institution Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). The âchocolatesâ came in the form of cash, laptop computers, televisions, and
appliances that were provided directly to Mexican government officials or indirectly through front companies that the officials owned. The
bribery scheme lasted for several years and yielded nearly $5 million in illegal profits for the Orthofix subsidiary.

Orthofix agreed to pay $5.2 million to settle the SEC's charges.

âOnce bribery has been likened to a box of chocolates, you know a corruptive culture has permeated your business,â said Kara Novaco
Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. âOrthofixâs lax oversight allowed its subsidiary to
illicitly spend more than $300,000 to sweeten the deals with Mexican officials.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the bribes began in 2003 and continued until
2010. Initially, Promeca falsely recorded the bribes as cash advances and falsified its invoices to support the expenditures. Later, when the
bribes got much larger, Promeca falsely recorded them as promotional and training costs. Because of the bribery scheme, Promecaâs training
and promotional expenses were significantly over budget. Orthofix did launch an inquiry into these expenses, but did very little to investigate
or diminish the excessive spending. Later, upon discovery of the bribe payments through a Promeca executive, Orthofix immediately self-
reported the matter to the SEC and implemented significant remedial measures. The company terminated the Promeca executives who
orchestrated the bribery scheme.

The SEC's proposed settlement is subject to court approval. Orthofix consented to a final judgment ordering it to pay $4,983,644 in
disgorgement and more than $242,000 in prejudgment interest. The final judgment would permanently enjoined the company from violating
the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. Orthofix also agreed to certain undertakings, including monitoring its
FCPA compliance program and reporting back to the SEC for a two-year period.

Orthofix also disclosed today in an 8-K filing that it has reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay a $2.22 million
penalty in a related action.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Carol Shau and Alka N. Patel in the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC acknowledges and
appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Criminal Division - Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
100 F Street, NE
Washington, DC 20549,
Plaintiff,
-\V-
PFIZER INC.,
235 East 42nd Street
New York, NY 10017,
Defendant.
COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ), alleges:

SUMMARY

1. This action arises from violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âthe FCPAââ) by Defendant Pfizer Inc.
(âPfizerââ), relating to improper payments made to foreign officials in numerous countries by the
employees and agents of Pfizerâs subsidiaries in order to assist Pfizer in obtaining or retaining
business.

2. At various times from at least 2001 through 2007, employees and agents of
subsidiaries of Pfizer, conducting business in Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy,
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Serbia, engaged in transactions for the purpose of improperly

influencing foreign officials, including doctors and other healthcare professionals employed by
foreign governments. These improper payments were variously made to influence regulatory
and formulary approvals, purchase decisions, prescription decisions, and to clear customs.
Employees in each of the involved subsidiaries attempted to conceal the true nature of the
transactions by improperly recording the transactions on the books and records of the respective
subsidiaries. Examples included falsely recording the payments as legitimate expenses for
promotional activities, marketing, training, travel and entertainment, clinical trials, freight,
conferences and advertising.

3. These improper payments were made without the knowledge or approval of
officers or employees of Pfizer, but the inaccurate books and records of Pfizerâs subsidiaries
were consolidated in the financial reports of Pfizer, and Pfizer failed to devise and maintain an
appropriate system of internal accounting controls.

4. As a result of this conduct, Pfizer violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) by failing to make and keep books, records and
accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
disposition of assets of the issuer. Additionally, by failing to ensure that it maintained adequate
internal controls to detect and prevent FCPA violations, Pfizer violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of
the Exchange Act, as it failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (1) transactions are executed in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; (11) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements; (111) transactions are recorded as
necessary to maintain accountability for assets; and (iv) that access to assets is permitted only in

accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization.
5. Pfizer made an initial voluntary disclosure of certain of these issues to the
Commission and Department of Justice in October 2004, and thereafter diligently and thoroughly
undertook a global internal investigation of its operations in no less than 19 countries, which
identified additional potential violations, and regularly reported on the results of these
investigations and fully cooperated with the staff of the Commission. Pfizer also undertook a
comprehensive compliance review of its operations, enhanced its internal controls and
compliance functions, engaged in significant disciplinary measures, and developed and
implemented global FCPA compliance procedures, including the development and

implementation of innovative proactive procedures, and sophisticated supporting systems.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].
7. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15

U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

DEFENDANTS

8. Pfizer Inc. (ââPfizerââ) is a global pharmaceutical company that discovers,
develops, manufactures and markets prescription medicines for humans and animals. Pfizer is
incorporated in the State of Delaware and is headquartered in New York, New York. Its
securities are registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and its
common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol âPFE.â Pfizer

conducts worldwide operations in over 180 countries, employing more than 100,000 people.
OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

9. Pfizer Italia S.r.1. is an Italian limited liability company and indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Pfizer.

10. Pfizer Investment Co. LTD is a Chinese company and indirect majority-owned
subsidiary of Pfizer.

11. Pfizer spol. s.r.o. is a Czech company and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Pfizer.

12. Pfizer H.C.P. Corporation (âPfizer HCPâ) is a New York Corporation and an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. During the relevant period, Pfizer HCP operated in
several international markets through representative offices, including offices in Bulgaria,
Croatia, Kazakhstan and Serbia, as well as through contracts with Russian distributors and
employees of its parent company who worked in a Pfizer representative office in Moscow.

13. Pharmacia Corporation (âPharmaciaâ) was a multinational pharmaceutical
company acquired by Pfizer on April 16, 2003 in a stock-for-stock transaction. Its international
operations were combined with Pfizerâs, including operations in Russia, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria,

Serbia and Croatia, which were thereafter restructured and incorporated into Pfizer HCP.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

14. The manufacture, registration, distribution, sale, and prescription of
pharmaceuticals are highly-regulated activities throughout the world. While there are
multinational regulatory schemes, it is typical that each country establishes its own regulatory
structure at a local, regional, and/or national level. These regulatory structures generally require
the registration of pharmaceuticals and regulate labeling and advertising. Additionally, in certain
countries the government establishes lists of pharmaceuticals that are approved for government

reimbursement or otherwise determines those pharmaceuticals that may be purchased by
government institutions. Moreover, countries often regulate the interactions between
pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, pharmacies, and healthcare professionals.

15. In those countries with national healthcare systems, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies,
doctors, and other healthcare professionals and institutions are generally government officials or
instrumentalities within the meaning of the FCPA.

16. During the relevant period, for the purpose of improperly influencing foreign
officials in connection with regulatory and formulary approvals, purchase decisions, prescription
decisions, and customs clearance, employees of Pfizerâs subsidiaries made and authorized the
making of payments of cash and the provision of other things of value both directly and through
third parties. Funds for these payments were often generated by the subsidiariesâ employees
through the use of collusive vendors, such as travel agents or restaurants, to create fraudulent
invoices.

A. Pfizer HCP Bulgaria

17. During the relevant period, Pfizer products were marketed in the Republic of
Bulgaria through a representative office of Pfizer HCP (âPfizer HCP Bulgariaâ).

18. From 1999 and continuing into 2005, Pfizer HCP Bulgaria, through its employees
and agents in Bulgaria, paid for domestic and international travel and provided equipment to
government-employed doctors. These payments were intended to influence these government
officials to prescribe Pfizer products.

19. Between 1999 and 2003, Pfizer HCP Bulgaria organized âIncentive Tripsâ to
destinations in Greece that were attended by Pfizer HCP Bulgaria sales representatives and
Bulgarian healthcare providers. Incentive Trips typically lasted three days and included both
educational training and hospitality and entertainment. Pfizer HCP Bulgaria sales

representatives were instructed to reach agreements with doctors on the specific quantities of

_5-
Pfizer pharmaceuticals they would prescribe in return for participation in these events. Pfizer
HCP Bulgaria employees also offered to support doctorsâ travel to medical conferences in
exchange for promises to use Pfizerâs products.

20. Pfizer HCP Bulgaria employees took steps to conceal the true nature of these
transactions by inaccurately recording the transactions as payments for educational or charitable
support.

B. Pfizer China

21. During the relevant period, Pfizerâs pharmaceutical products were promoted in
the Peopleâs Republic of China by Pfizerâs subsidiary based in Beijing, Pfizer Investment Co.
LTD (âPfizer Chinaâ).

22. From at least 2003 through 2007, Pfizer China, through its employees and agents,
provided cash payments, hospitality, gifts, and support for international travel to doctors
employed by Chinese government healthcare institutions. The payments of cash and other things
of value were intended to influence these government officials to prescribe Pfizer products,
provide hospital formulary listing, and otherwise use their influence to grant Pfizer China an
unfair advantage.

23. Pfizer China employees provided these improper payments in recognition of past
product sales or prescriptions, as incentives to prescribe or purchase Pfizer products in the future,
or upon the basis of Pfizer China employeesâ assessments of the doctorsâ potential prescribing
levels.

24. To facilitate the payment of rewards and incentives, Pfizer China employees
organized meetings with Chinese government doctors that were marketed as âclubsâ or âhigh-
prescribing doctorsâ programs. Invitations to such events were provided to doctors in

recognition of past product sales or prescriptions, or as incentives to prescribe or purchase Pfizer

_6-
products in the future. In some cases, meeting agendas included only minimal professional
content and extensive recreational and entertainment activities.

25. Pfizer China also created various âpoint programs,â under which government
doctors could accumulate points based upon the number of Pfizer prescriptions they had written.
The points could be redeemed for various gifts, some of which were related to the practice of
medicine (e.g., medical books), but others that were gifts of a personal nature (e.g., cell phones,
tea sets, and reading glasses).

26. Pfizer China employees offered and provided financial and other support for
Chinese doctors to attend domestic and international conferences in return for explicit
agreements to prescribe, purchase, or recommend Pfizer products. For example, in March 2006,
a Pfizer China marketing manager explained to his regional sales manager that Pfizer China
would only offer to support travel to a conference in Australia for two doctors if they promised
to âuse no less than 4,200 injections a yearâ and to prescribe a Pfizer product to âmore than
80%â of their patients.

27. Pfizer China employees also offered and provided small cash payments in order to
influence doctors to prescribe Pfizer products. These payments were directly linked to the
volume of Pfizer products prescribed by those doctors.

28. Pfizer China employees took steps to conceal the true nature of the cash
payments, gifts, and travel support made to Chinese government doctors by failing to accurately
record the transactions.

C. Pfizer HCP Croatia
29. During the relevant period, Pfizer products were marketed in the Republic of

Croatia through a representative office of Pfizer HCP (âPfizer HCP Croatiaâ). Prior to the 2003
merger with Pfizer, Pharmacia also operated a representative office in Croatia (âPharmacia
Croatiaâ).

30. From at least 1997 and continuing to late 2004, Pfizer HCP Croatia, Pharmacia
Croatia, and their employees and agents in Croatia made payments and provided benefits to
doctors employed by the Croatian government. The payments of cash and other things of value
were intended to influence these government officials to prescribe Pharmacia and Pfizer products
and to provide regulatory approvals for Pharmacia and Pfizer products.

31. From February 1997 until May 2003, Pharmacia Croatia made monthly payments
of approximately $1,200 per month to the Austrian bank account of a doctor who served as a
member of several Croatian government committees that oversaw the registration and
reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. A memorandum prepared in April 1997 by a senior
Pharmacia Croatia manager stated that the Croatian doctor was expected to ensure that all of
Pharmaciaâs products were approved for registration and reimbursement by the relevant
committees and noted that âas he is a member of the Registration Committee regarding
pharmaceuticals, I do expect that all products which are to be registered, will pass the regular
procedure by his assistance. ... He is a person of great influence in Croatia in the area of
pharmaceuticals, and his opinion is respected very much; thatâs the reason he is so important to
us.â

32. Pharmacia Croatia continued to make the payments to the Croatian doctor until
the Pharmacia/Pfizer merger in early 2003. After the merger, Pfizer HCP Croatia made three
separate payments in or around April, May, and July 2003. During this period, the committees
on which the doctor served approved three Pfizer products. No further payments were made to

the doctor after July 2003.
33. Pharmacia Croatia also made payments and provided benefits under a âBonus
Programâ to Croatian doctors who were employed in senior positions in Croatian government
healthcare institutions. Under the Bonus Program, once a doctor agreed to use Pharmaciaâs
products, a percentage of the value of Pharmacia products purchased by a doctorâs institution
would be given back to the doctor in the form of cash payments, international travel support,
donations of durable goods, or free products.

34. Although Pfizer HCP Croatia ended the majority of the Bonus Program payments
after the 2003 merger, it permitted the program to continue with respect to one Pharmacia
product until 2005. For example, a Pfizer HCP Croatia sales representative wrote to her manager
in early 2004 recommending that Pfizer enter into bonus agreements âtied to specific salesâ and
explaining that she had entered into a bonus agreement with a senior doctor in the past and that
âthe increase in sales of [a Pharmacia product] was immediately evident.â Based on this
recommendation, Pfizer HCP Croatia authorized the employee to enter into an unwritten 12%
bonus agreement with the doctor, paid the expenses and hotel accommodations of the doctor and
his colleagues to attend a conference in Lisbon, and purchased a television that was to be used in
the doctorâs office.

35. Pfizer HCP Croatia employees took steps to conceal the true nature of these
transactions and failed to accurately record these transactions by falsely booking them as
âConventions,â âGifts,â and âProfessional Services â Non Consultantâ expenses, among other
false and misleading descriptions.

D. Pfizer Czech

36. During the relevant period, in the Czech Republic, Pfizerâs pharmaceutical

products were marketed and sold through Pfizerâs subsidiary, Pfizer spol. s.r.o. (âPfizer Czechâ).
37. From at least 2003 and through 2004, Pfizer Czech, through its employees and
agents, provided support for international travel and recreational opportunities to doctors
employed by the Czech government with the intent to influence these government officials to
prescribe Pfizer products.

38. For example, in October 2004, Pfizer Czech paid for a group of Czech
government-employed doctors and pharmacists to visit a Pfizer manufacturing facility in Perth,
Australia. In connection with the site visit, Pfizer Czech provided sightseeing opportunities for
the government doctors, including layovers in Hong Kong, visits to Australian landmarks, and
additional free time in Australia at the end of the program. At least one of the attending doctors
participated in meetings of a committee that advises the Czech Ministry of Health on drug
reimbursement issues.

39. Similarly, from 2003 through 2004, Pfizer Czech organized and sponsored
approximately 10 âeducational weekendsâ that approximately 920 healthcare professionals
attended, including doctors employed by the Czech government. The events were held at resort
destinations, including ski resorts in Austria and Slovakia, usually over a three-day period. The
events typically included skiing or other recreational activities for the majority of the weekend,
and had little legitimate promotional or educational content.

AO. Pfizer Czech employees took steps to conceal the true nature of these transactions,
and failed to accurately record these transactions by falsely booking them as âConventions and

Trade Meeting,â among other false and misleading descriptions.

E. Pfizer Italy

Al. During the relevant period, Pfizer products were marketed and sold in the

Republic of Italy through Pfizerâs subsidiary, Pfizer Italia S.r.1 (âPfizer Italyââ).

-10-
42. From at least 2001 and continuing through early 2004, Pfizer Italy provided,
directly or through vendors, cash payments, gifts, support for domestic and international travel,
and other benefits to doctors employed by Italian government healthcare institutions. The
payments of cash and other things of value were intended to influence these government officials
to prescribe Pfizer products.

43. For example, from at least 1996 through 2003, Pfizer Italy engaged third parties
to run observational studies conducted by doctors employed by Italian government healthcare
institutions, purportedly to obtain research and marketing information from Italian doctors. In
reality, many of the âobservational studiesâ lacked scientific value and were instead designed to
improperly influence Italian government doctors to prescribe Pfizer products. Medical personnel
were not solely responsible for selecting the doctors to participate, but instead, Pfizer Italy sales
personnel selected doctors to participate based on the doctorsâ agreement to prescribe Pfizer
products at specific levels. The Pfizer sales personnel directed cash payments, gifts and other
benefits to the doctors, and monitored the performance of the doctors to ensure that the agreed-
upon prescription levels were met.

44. From at least 2000 to 2003, Pfizer Italy employees also made direct cash
payments (ostensibly honoraria and lecture fees), provided goods (e.g., televisions, monitors,

mobile telephones, photocopiers, printers), and improper travel sponsorship (e.g., âweekend in

99 66 99 66

European capital,â âweekend in Gallipoli,â âweekend with companion,â âweekend in Romeâ) in
return for promises by doctors to recommend or prescribe Pfizerâs products.

45. Pfizer Italy employees took steps to conceal the true nature of these transactions
and failed to accurately record these transactions by falsely booking them as âMarketing

Expenses,â âProfessional Training,â and âAdvertising in Scientific Journals,â among other false

and misleading descriptions.

-11-
F. Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan

46. During the relevant period, Pfizer products were marketed in the Republic of
Kazakhstan through a representative office of Pfizer HCP (âPfizer HCP Kazakhstanâ).

47. In 2000, Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan applied to the Kazakh government for approval
of the registration of a Pfizer product for sale in Kazakhstan. At about the same time, two
representatives of Company A, a Kazakh company, approached Pfizerâs Regional Manager for
the Central Asia and Caucasus region at a pharmaceuticals conference in Tashkent, Uzbekistan
and requested an exclusive distributorship of the Pfizer product. When the Regional Manager
informed Company Aâs representatives that Pfizer policy prohibited exclusive arrangements, the
representatives stated that if Company A did not receive the exclusive distributorship, Pfizer
HCP Kazakhstan would be unable to sell the Pfizer product in Kazakhstan.

A8. Following this meeting, Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan experienced substantial difficulty
obtaining approval of its registration, including receiving numerous requests for additional
documentation and clinical trial data. Despite Pfizer HCP Kazakhstanâs compliance with these
requests, the Kazakh government did not grant approval. The Regional Manager explained the
situation to his supervisor and indicated in contemporaneous internal correspondence that he
believed that Company A was associated with senior Kazakh government officials.

49. Company A subsequently contacted the Regional Manager and again demanded
an exclusive distributorship. In May 2000, Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan executed a written
distribution agreement for the Pfizer product with Company A, and the Regional Manager
verbally agreed with Company A that this relationship would be exclusive. Pfizer HCP
Kazakhstan and Company A later entered into two other distribution agreements.

50. Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan granted Company A the distributorship in order to

improperly obtain approval for the registration of the Pfizer product in Kazakhstan. Soon after

-12-
the May 2000 agreement was reached, the Kazakh government approved a three-year registration
for the Pfizer product.

51. During the period in which Company A had an exclusive arrangement for the
Pfizer product, sales were lower than projected. As a result, in early 2003, Pfizer HCP
Kazakhstan, without objection from Company A, terminated the exclusive relationship and
entered into agreements with two other distributors.

52. In September 2003, Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan was required to renew its registration
for the Pfizer product with the Kazakh government, and Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan again
encountered difficulties obtaining approval. Company A again offered to help and sought an
exclusive distributorship. Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan did not grant Company A an exclusive
distributorship in 2003, but did sign an additional contract and maintained a non-exclusive
distributor relationship through mid-2005 believing that some of the profits from Company A
would be provided to senior Kazakh government officials for their assistance in obtaining
registration.

53. The Kazakh government approved the renewal of the registration for the Pfizer
product for sale in Kazakhstan near in time to when Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan signed the
additional contract with Company A.

G. Pfizer Russia

54. During the relevant period, in the Russian Federation, Pfizerâs pharmaceutical
products were imported and distributed by Russian wholesalers who contracted directly with
Pfizer HCP, and were marketed by employees of a Pfizer representative office located in
Moscow (âPfizer Russiaâ). Prior to its acquisition, Pharmacia also operated a representative

office in Russia (âPharmacia Russiaâ).

-13-
55. From at least 2000 and through 2005, Pfizer Russia, through its employees and
agents, provided cash payments, gifts, support for domestic and international travel, and
donations to doctors employed by the Russian government and other government officials. The
payments of cash and other benefits were intended to obtain regulatory approvals relating to
Pfizer products, to avoid delays and penalties associated with the importation of certain Pfizer

products, and to influence the doctors to prescribe Pfizer products.

âHospital Programâ? Payments

56. From as early as the mid-1990s through 2005, Pfizer Russia engaged in a sales
initiative referred to as the âHospital Program.â Under this program, Pfizer Russia employees
were permitted to provide payments to hospitals of 5% of the value of certain Pfizer products
purchased by the hospitals as price discounts or in-kind benefits to hospitals for their purchases.
In practice, some Hospital Program payments were made directly to or for the benefit of
individual Russian doctors to reward past purchases and prescriptions and induce future
purchases and prescriptions of Pfizer products.

57. In addition to direct payments, Pfizer Russia also made Hospital Program
payments through intermediary companies. In some cases the intermediary companies were
identified by the recipient doctors, and in other cases they were selected by Pfizer Russia
employees.

58. Employees of Pfizer Russia obtained cash for the Hospital Program payments
with the assistance of collusive vendors who provided the cash to Pfizer Russia employees after
receiving payment on the basis of false invoices. Pfizer Russia employees would then use the
cash to make payments to doctors to reward past purchases and prescriptions and induce future

purchases and prescriptions of Pfizer products.

-14-
59. The then-finance director of Pfizer Russia established two account codes in the
companyâs General Ledger and instructed employees to book all their Hospital Program
payments to this account, including improper payments. From in or around December 2003
through 2005, Pfizer Russia booked approximately $820,000 in transactions to the two Hospital

Program account codes.

Distributor Discount Payments

60. A number of Pfizer Russiaâs distributors made cash payments, referred to as
âdiscounts,â to hospital administrators responsible for hospital purchasing decisions. These
payments were used to reward past purchases and induce future purchases.

61. For example, in an email dated November 24, 2005, Pfizer Russia employees
discussed the calculation of a âbasic discountâ of approximately $1,652, which was reportedly
made by the distributor by providing cash in an envelope to a government doctor at the hospital

in order to reward past purchases and induce future purchases.

Improper Travel

62. Pfizer Russia employees sought to use conference attendance or travel to
influence the inclusion of Pfizer products in tenders or on formulary lists, and to induce
healthcare providers to prescribe or purchase Pfizer products.

63. For example, on or about November 19, 2003 in an invoice cover letter, a Pfizer
Russia employee requested âpayment for the (motivational) trip of [the First Deputy Minister of
Health] for the inclusion of [a Pfizer product] into the list . . . of medications refundable by the
stateâ in order to influence the First Deputy Minister of Health to add the Pfizer product to the
regional formulary list.

64. Similarly, on or about December 2, 2004, a Pfizer Russia employee requested

sponsorship for a Moscow Department of Health employee who was assisting the chief

-15-
pharmacologist of a regional pediatric hospital in compiling algorithms for antibiotic therapy,
and who wanted âto be financially compensatedâ for this work. The Pfizer Russia employee
noted that, âin return for this,â the pharmacologist âwill include our products in the treatment
algorithms.â The treatment algorithms by the pharmacologist, a government official, constituted
the official government-recommended treatment.

65. Another example is an email dated June 27, 2005, in which a Pfizer Russia
employee noted that a government doctor âshould be assigned the task of stretching the amount
of the purchases... to US $100 thousandâ as an âobligationâ in exchange for a trip to a
conference in the Netherlands or Germany. Subsequently, on or about September 14, 2005, a
Pfizer Russia employee emailed that an âagreement on cooperationâ had been reached with the
government doctor, and that Pfizer Russiaâs requirements were the âpurchase quantities,â and the
doctorâs requirement was âa trip to a conference.â

66. On or about September 8, 2003, a Pfizer Russia employee emailed colleagues
regarding the request by a government doctor for sponsorship to attend a conference and noted
that he âhas pledged to prescribe at least 20 packs of [a Pfizer product] per month, and 20 packs
[of another Pfizer product].â

Customs Related Payments

67. During the relevant period, Russian Federation customs officials would not clear
pharmaceutical products for importation unless the importer provided an official certification
indicating that the products conformed to the specific terms of the product registration and
packaging requirements filed by the manufacturer with the Ministry of Health. The Russian
government licensed a private certification company (the âCertification Centerâ) to perform this

governmental function, which performed inspections and furnished the necessary certificates.

-16-
68. In the spring of 2005, Pfizer Russia began to experience increasing difficulty in
obtaining the necessary certificates because the Pfizer products did not conform to the precise
terms of the product registration and packaging requirements filed with the Ministry of Health.

69. On or about September or October 2005, a Certification Center employee
proposed that the Certification Center would overlook the non-compliance of Pfizer Russiaâs
products in exchange for monthly payments of approximately $3,000. With the approval of the
then-Pfizer Russia Country Manager, between October and December 2005 Pfizer Russia made
payments of over $13,000 through an intermediary company, which then forwarded the
payments to a company Pfizer Russia employees believed to be controlled by the Certification
Centerâs employees.

70. The customs clearing problems ceased after Pfizer Russia started making
payments, but they resumed when Pfizer Russia stopped the payments in 2006 after Pfizer began

a Corporate Compliance review in Russia.

Use of Intermediaries to Make Payments

71. Pfizer Russia also used third-party intermediaries to make improper payments
intended to increase the sales of pharmaceuticals. This practice was known to and approved by
senior leadership in Pfizer Russia, including the Country Manager and the Finance Director.

72. For example, on or about April 7, 2004, a Pfizer Russia employee requested that a
payment be made to a public official from Samara âwho took an active part in getting [a Pfizer
product] into the bidding.â This request was supported by two invoice cover letters. The first
was dated March 9, 2004, for 100,000 rubles (approximately $3,800) for âpayment for the
service of [an employee of the State Department of Samara Healthcare] for the purchase of [a
Pfizer product]â in the Samara Region. The second invoice cover letter was dated April 16,

2004, for a payment of approximately $4,500 for âhospital program for purchase of [a Pfizer

-17-
product] ... to civil servant [] of health service of Samara,â but was directed to an intermediary
company used by Pfizer Russia to make improper payments to public officials.

73. In or about October 2005, Pfizer Russia employees discussed how a regional
distributor would provide Pfizer Russia with companies that have âneutral names,â to which
Pfizer Russia could make improper payments that would be booked as conferences to provide

benefits to doctors.

Offshore Payments of Sales Discounts

74. Pfizer Russia, through its employees and agents, continued and expanded a
Pharmacia Russia practice of paying sales discounts owed to Russian distributors into offshore
bank accounts. At least as early as 1999, Pharmacia Russia had entered into arrangements with
one of its distributors by which sales discounts owed the distributor were paid into accounts of
the distributorâs shell companies located in Latvia and Cyprus.

75. Pfizer Russia continued the practice of making payments to the distributorâ s
Cyprus shell company following the 2003 merger with Pharmacia. In 2003 and 2004, Pfizer
Russia management entered into similar arrangements for the benefit of two other Russian
distributors that had set up shell companies in Canada and Hungary for this purpose.

76. Pfizer Russiaâs management attempted to hide the true nature of the relationship
with the Cyprus distributor from Pfizer HCPâs regional management located in Germany. In
2003 and 2004, when regional managers questioned the Cyprus payments, Pfizer Russiaâs
Country Manager claimed that the shell companies actually were providing lobbying services
necessary to âgain accessâ to the Russian public sector tender market.

77. Pfizer HCPâs regional management did not verify that the Country Managerâs
explanation was accurate, nor did they follow up to understand how a third-party intermediary

being paid outside Russia could lawfully help Pfizer Russia âgain accessâ to Russian government

-18-
tenders. The practice continued through early 2005, when it was ended unilaterally by Pfizer
Russia (prior to Pfizerâs commencement of an internal investigation in the market).

78. Pfizer Russia employees took steps to conceal the true nature of these various
improper transactions, and failed to accurately record these transactions by booking them as
âTravel and Entertainment,â âConvention and Trade Meetings,â âConferences,â âDistribution
Freight,â and âClinical Grants/Clinical Trials,â among other false and misleading descriptions.

H. Pfizer HCP Serbia

79. During the relevant period, Pfizer products were marketed in the Republic of
Serbia and Montenegro through a representative office of Pfizer HCP (âPfizer HCP Serbiaâ).

80. Pfizer HCP Serbia, through one of its sales representatives, paid for a government
employed doctor to attend a conference in Chile in exchange for the doctorâs agreement to
increase his departmentâs purchases of Pfizer products. Although Pfizer HCP Serbia
management discovered the improper agreement and terminated the responsible sales
representative, it still provided the support after the doctor threatened to spread negative
information about Pfizerâs reputation as a company.
I. Accounting and Internal Controls

81. As described above, four Pfizer subsidiaries engaged in transactions in eight
countries which were intended to improperly influence foreign government officials in
connection with regulatory and formulary approvals, purchase decisions, prescription decisions,
and customs clearance. Through the four subsidiaries, Pfizer earned aggregate profits of
$16,032,676 as a result of these improper transactions.

82. As described above, during the relevant period the Pfizer subsidiaries recorded
transactions associated with the improper payments in a manner that did not accurately reflect

their true nature and purpose. The false entries in the subsidiariesâ books and records were

-19-
consolidated into the books and records of Pfizer, which reported the results of its subsidiariesâ
operations in its consolidated financial statements.

83. As described above, during the relevant period Pfizer failed to devise and
maintain an effective system of internal controls sufficient to prevent or detect the above-

described conduct.

J. Remedial Efforts

84. Pfizer has taken extensive remedial actions including: undertaking a
comprehensive worldwide review of its compliance program; implementing enhanced anti-
corruption compliance policies and procedures on a worldwide basis; developing global systems
to support employee compliance with the enhanced procedures; adding FCPA-specific reviews
to its internal audits; performing innovative and proactive anti-corruption compliance reviews in
approximately 10 markets annually; and conducting comprehensive anti-corruption training

throughout the organization.

SEC Charges Pfizer with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-152

Washington, D.C., Aug. 7, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Pfizer Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries bribed doctors and other health care professionals employed by foreign governments in order to
win business.

The SEC alleges that employees and agents of Pfizerâs subsidiaries in Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Kazakhstan, Russia, and
Serbia made improper payments to foreign officials to obtain regulatory and formulary approvals, sales, and increased prescriptions for the
companyâs pharmaceutical products. They tried to conceal the bribery by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as
legitimate expenses for promotional activities, marketing, training, travel and entertainment, clinical trials, freight, conferences, and
advertising.

The SEC separately charged another pharmaceutical company that Pfizer acquired a few years ago - Wyeth LLC - with its own FCPA
violations. Pfizer and Wyeth agreed to separate settlements in which they will pay more than $45 million combined to settle their respective
charges. In a parallel action, the Department of Justice announced that Pfizer H.C.P. Corporation agreed to pay a $15 million penalty to
resolve its investigation of FCPA violations.

âPfizer subsidiaries in several countries had bribery so entwined in their sales culture that they offered points and bonus programs to
improperly reward foreign officials who proved to be their best customers,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. âThese charges illustrate the pitfalls that exist for companies that fail to appropriately monitor potential
risks in their global operations.â

According to the SECâs complaint against Pfizer filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the misconduct dates back as far as
2001. Employees of Pfizerâs subsidiaries authorized and made cash payments and provided other incentives to bribe government doctors to
utilize Pfizer products. In China, for example, Pfizer employees invited âhigh-prescribing doctorsâ in the Chinese government to club-like
meetings that included extensive recreational and entertainment activities to reward doctorsâ past product sales or prescriptions. Pfizer China
also created various âpoint programsâ under which government doctors could accumulate points based on the number of Pfizer prescriptions
they wrote. The points were redeemed for various gifts ranging from medical books to cell phones, tea sets, and reading glasses. In Croatia,
Pfizer employees created a âbonus programâ for Croatian doctors who were employed in senior positions in Croatian government health care
institutions. Once a doctor agreed to use Pfizer products, a percentage of the value purchased by a doctorâs institution would be funneled
back to the doctor in the form of cash, international travel, or free products.

According to the SECâs complaint, Pfizer made an initial voluntary disclosure of misconduct by its subsidiaries to the SEC and Department of
Justice in October 2004, and fully cooperated with SEC investigators. Pfizer took such extensive remedial actions as undertaking a
comprehensive worldwide review of its compliance program.

The SEC further alleges that Wyeth subsidiaries engaged in FCPA violations primarily before but also after the companyâs acquisition by Pfizer
in late 2009. Starting at least in 2005, subsidiaries marketing Wyeth nutritional products in China, Indonesia, and Pakistan bribed government
doctors to recommend their products to patients by making cash payments or in some cases providing BlackBerrys and cell phones or travel
incentives. They often used fictitious invoices to conceal the true nature of the payments. In Saudi Arabia, Wyethâs subsidiary made an
improper cash payment to a customs official to secure the release of a shipment of promotional items used for marketing purposes. The
promotional items were held in port because Wyeth Saudi Arabia had failed to secure a required Saudi Arabian Standards Organization
Certificate of Conformity.

Following Pfizerâs acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer undertook a risk-based FCPA due diligence review of Wyethâs global operations and voluntarily
reported the findings to the SEC staff. Pfizer diligently and promptly integrated Wyethâs legacy operations into its compliance program and
cooperated fully with SEC investigators.

In settling the SECâs charges, Wyeth neither admitted nor denied the allegations. Pfizer consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it
to pay disgorgement of $16,032,676 in net profits and prejudgment interest of $10,307,268 for a total of $26,339,944. Wyeth also is required
to report to the SEC on the status of its remediation and implementation of compliance measures over a two-year period, and is permanently
enjoined from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Wyeth consented to the entry
of a final judgment ordering it to pay disgorgement of $17,217,831 in net profits and prejudgment interest of $1,658,793, for a total of
$18,876,624. As a Pfizer subsidiary, the status of Wyethâs remediation and implementation of compliance measures will be subsumed in
Pfizer's two-year self-reporting period. Wyeth also is permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of
the Exchange Act. The settlements are subject to court approval.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Michael Catoe and Charles Cain of the Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. The SEC acknowledges
the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ) alleges:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

l. This matter involves violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by Oracle Corporation (âOracleâ or âthe
Companyâ), a Redwood Shores, California-based software company. From 2005 to 2007, certain
employees of Oracleâs Indian subsidiary Oracle India Private Limited (âOracle Indiaâ) secretly
âparkedâ a portion of the proceeds from certain sales to the Indian government and put the money to
unauthorized use, creating the potential for bribery or embezzlement. These Oracle India employees
structured more than a dozen transactions so that a total of around $2.2 million was held by the

Companyâs distributors and kept off Oracle Indiaâs corporate books. The Oracle India employees

would then direct its distributor to disburse payments out of the unauthorized side funds to purported
local âvendors.â Several of the âvendorsâ were merely storefronts that did not provide any services.

2. Oracle failed to accurately record these side funds on the Companyâs books and
records, and failed to implement or maintain a system of effective internal accounting controls to
prevent improper side funds in violation of the FCPA, which requires public companies to keep
books and records that accurately reflect their operations.

3. The Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining Oracle from violations of the
books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and requiring Oracle to pay a civil
monetary penalty.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 27 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d) and 78aa]. Defendant has,
directly or indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and of the
mails in connection with the acts, transactions, practices and courses of business alleged in this
Complaint.

5. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.
Â§ 78aa] because Defendant maintains its headquarters and transacts business within the Northern
District of California.

6. Intradistrict assignment to the San Francisco Division is proper pursuant to Civil
L.R. 3-2(c) because Oracleâs headquarters is located in the County of San Mateo.

DEFENDANT

7. Oracle Corporation is a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Redwood Shores,
California. Oracle is an enterprise software company and a provider of computer hardware products
and services. Shares of Oracle stock are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of
the Exchange Act and the company files reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act. The
companyâs shares are listed on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol âORCL.â Oracle

operates in India through its wholly-owned subsidiary Oracle India Private Limited.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

A. Oracle India Employees Created A Side Fund At Its Distributors And Did Not Properly

Account For It

8. From 2005 to 2007, Oracle India sold products and services to Indian government end
users through local distributors and then directed excess funds from the sales to be âparkedâ outside
Oracleâs books and records.

9. At the time, Oracle Indiaâs typical business model involved selling Oracle software
licenses and services through local distributors who had written agreements with Oracle India. In the
transactions at issue, Oracle India was heavily involved in identifying and working with the end user
customers in selling products and services to them and negotiating the final price. The purchase
order, however, was placed by the customer with Oracle Indiaâs distributor. The distributor bought
the licenses and services directly from Oracle, and then resold them to the customer at the higher
price that had been negotiated by Oracle India. The difference between what the government end user
paid the distributor and what the distributor paid Oracle typically is referred to as âmargin,â which the
distributor generally retains as payment for its services.

10. Onapproximately 14 occasions related to 8 different government contracts between
2005 and 2007, certain Oracle India employees created extra margins between the end user and
distributor price and directed the distributors to hold the extra margin in side funds. Oracle Indiaâs
employees made these margins large enough to ensure a side fund existed to pay third parties. At the
direction of the Oracle India employees, the distributor then made payments out of the side funds to
third parties, purportedly for marketing and development expenses. Some of the recipients of these
payments were not on Oracleâs approved local vendor list; indeed, some of the third parties did not
exist and were merely storefronts.

11. Because the Oracle India employees concealed the existence of the side fund, Oracle
did not properly account for these side funds. These funds constituted prepaid marketing expenses
incurred by Oracle India and should have been recorded as an asset and rolled up to Oracleâs
corporate books and records. These marketing expenses should then have been reflected in the

income statement once they were used. Instead, the parked funds were not reflected on Oracle Indiaâs

o~ om

books and were not properly recorded as prepaid marketing expenses. This incorrect accounting in
turn affected Oracleâs books and records.

12. Between 2005 and 2007, government customers paid Oracle Indiaâs distributors at
least $6.7 million on these sales, with Oracle receiving approximately $4.5 million in revenue,

resulting in about $2.2 million in funds improperly âparkedâ with the Companyâs distributors.

B. Absent Proper Controls, Oracle India Employees Used Side Funds To Pay Unauthorized

Third Parties

13. Oracle Indiaâs parked funds created a risk that they potentially could be used for illicit
means, such as bribery or embezzlement. Such risk can be highlighted by the following example of
the largest government contract that involved parked funds used for unauthorized third party
payments.

14. In May 2006, Oracle India secured a $3.9 million deal with Indiaâs Ministry of
Information Technology and Communications. Oracleâs distributor accepted payment from the end
user for the full $3.9 million. Under the direction of Oracle Indiaâs then Sales Director, the
distributor sent approximately $2.1 million to Oracle, which Oracle booked as revenue on the
transaction. |

15. Oracle India employees then directed the distributor to keep approximately $151,000
as payment for the distributorâs services. The Oracle India employees further instructed the
distributor to âparkâ the remaining approximately $1.7 million to be used for disbursement towards
âmarketing development purposes.â Several Oracle India employees were aware of the parked funds
arrangement, which violated Oracleâs internal corporate policies.

16. | Two months later, an Oracle India employee provided Oracle Indiaâs distributor with
eight invoices for payments to third party vendors, in amounts ranging from approximately $110,000
to $396,000. These invoices were later found to be fake. None of these third parties, which were just
storefronts and provided no services on the deal, were on Oracleâs approved vendor list. As directed
by the Oracle India employees, the distributor sent out the third party payments, which created the

potential that they could be used for bribery or embezzlement.

17. | Oracle lacked the proper controls to prevent its employees at Oracle India from
creating and misusing the parked funds. For example, Oracle knew distributor discounts created a
margin of cash from which distributors received payments for their services. Before 2009, however,
the Company failed to audit and compare the distributorâs margin against the end user price to ensure
excess margins were not being built into the pricing structure.

18. âIn addition, although Oracle maintained corporate policies requiring approvals for
payment of marketing expenses, Oracle failed to seek transparency in or audit third party payments
made by distributors on Oracle Indiaâs behalf. This control would have enabled Oracle to check that

payments were made to appropriate recipients.
C. Oracle Later Implemented Remedial Measures To Improve FCPA Compliance

19, By November 2007, Oracle Indiaâs Senior Channel Sales Manager had resigned and
left Oracle India. As a result of an internal investigation that the Oracle Asia division escalated after
a local tax inquiry to Oracle Indiaâs distributor, Oracle terminated four other Oracle India employees
based on their knowledge that Oracle India parked funds at its distributors.

20.â In addition, Oracle took other remedial measures to address the risk and controls
related to parked funds, including: conducting additional due diligence in its partner transactions in
India so that Oracle had greater transparency into end user pricing in government contracts;
terminating its relationship with the distributor involved in the transactions at issue; directing its
distributors not to allow the creation of side funds; requiring additional representations and warranties
from distributors to include the fact that no side funds exist; and enhancing training for its partners
and employees to address anti-corruption policies. |

SEC Charges Oracle Corporation With FCPA Violations Related to
Secret Side Funds in India

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-158

Washington, D.C., Aug. 16, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Oracle Corporation with violating the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by failing to prevent a subsidiary from secretly setting aside money off the company's books that was eventually
used to make unauthorized payments to phony vendors in India.

The SEC alleges that certain employees of the India subsidiary of the Redwood Shores, Calif.-based enterprise systems firm structured
transactions with India's government on more than a dozen occasions in a way that enabled Oracle India's distributors to hold approximately
$2.2 million of the proceeds in unauthorized side funds. Those Oracle India employees then directed the distributors to make payments out of
these side funds to purported local vendors, several of which were merely storefronts that did not provide any services to Oracle. Oracle's
subsidiary documented certain payments with fake invoices.

Oracle agreed to pay a $2 million penalty to settle the SEC's charges.

""Through its subsidiary's use of secret cash cushions, Oracle exposed itself to the risk that these hidden funds would be put to illegal use,""
said Marc J. Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office. ""It is important for U.S. companies to proactively establish policies and
procedures to minimize the potential for payments to foreign officials or other unauthorized uses of company funds.""

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the misconduct at Oracle's India subsidiary -
Oracle India Private Limited - occurred from 2005 to 2007. Oracle India sold software licenses and services to India's government through
local distributors, and then had the distributors ""park"" excess funds from the sales outside Oracle India's books and records.

For example, according to the SEC's complaint, Oracle India secured a $3.9 million deal with India's Ministry of Information Technology and
Communications in May 2006. As instructed by Oracle India's then-sales director, only $2.1 million was sent to Oracle to record as revenue on
the transaction, and the distributor kept $151,000 for services rendered. Certain other Oracle India employees further instructed the
distributor to park the remaining $1.7 million for ""marketing development purposes."" Two months later, one of those same Oracle India
employees created and provided to the distributor eight invoices for payments to purported third-party vendors ranging from $110,000 to
$396,000. In fact, none of these storefront-only third parties provided any services or were included on Oracle's approved vendor list. The
third-party payments created the risk that the funds could be used for illicit purposes such as bribery or embezzlement.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Oracle violated the FCPA's books and records provisions and internal controls provisions by failing to
accurately record the side funds that Oracle India maintained with its distributors. Oracle failed to devise and maintain a system of effective
internal controls that would have prevented the improper use of company funds.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Oracle consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay the $2
million penalty and permanently enjoining it from future violations of these provisions. The settlement takes into account Oracle's voluntary
disclosure of the conduct in India and its cooperation with the SEC's investigation, as well as remedial measures taken by the company,
including firing the employees involved in the misconduct and making significant enhancements to its FCPA compliance program.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by staff attorney Elena Ro and Assistant Regional Director Jina Choi in the San Francisco Regional
Office. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Internal Revenue
Service.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,

100 F Street, N.E.
Washington, DC 20549,
Plaintiff,
Civil Action No.
vs.
TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD., COMPLAINT

Freier Platz 10
CH-8200 Schaffhausen
Switzerland,

Defendant.

 

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ or ""Commission"") alleges:
NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This matter concerns violations by Tyco International Ltd. (âTycoâ) of the books
and records, internal controls, and anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ).

2. Tyco is an international global manufacturing company based in Switzerland with
operations around the world. Tycoâs securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

3. In April 2006, the Commission filed a settled accounting fraud, disclosure, and
FCPA injunctive action against Tyco, pursuant to which the company consented to entry of a
final judgment enjoining it from violations of the anti-fraud, periodic reporting, books and
records, internal controls, proxy disclosure, and anti-bribery provisions of the federal securities

laws and ordering it to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $50 million civil penalty. The U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York entered the settled Final Judgment against Tyco on
May 1, 2006. At the time of settlement, Tyco had already committed to and commenced a
review of its FCPA compliance and a global, comprehensive internal investigation of possible
additional FCPA violations. As a result of that review and investigation, certain FCPA
violations have come to light for which the misconduct occurred, or the benefit to Tyco
continued, after the 2006 injunction. Those are the violations that are alleged in this Complaint.

4. As its global review and investigation progressed, Tyco voluntarily disclosed this
conduct to the Commission and took significant, broad-spectrum remedial measures. Those
remedial measures include: the initial FCPA review of every Tyco legal operating entity â
ultimately including 454 entities in 50 separate countries; active monitoring and evaluation of all
of Tycoâs agents and other relevant third-party relationships; quarterly ethics and compliance
training by over 4,000 middle-managers; FCPA-focused on-site reviews of higher risk entities;
creation of a corporate Ombudsmanâs office and numerous segment-specific compliance counsel
positions; exit from several business operations in high-risk areas; and the termination of over 90
employees, including supervisors, because of FCPA-compliance concerns.

5. The FCPA misconduct reported by Tyco showed that Tycoâs books and records
were misstated as a result of at least twelve different, post-injunction illicit payment schemes
occurring at Tyco subsidiaries across the globe. The schemes frequently entailed illicit payments
to foreign officials that were inaccurately recorded so as to conceal the nature of the payments.
Those inaccurate entries were incorporated into Tycoâs books and records. Tyco thereby

violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15

U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].
6. Tyco also failed to devise and maintain internal controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that all transactions were properly recorded in the companyâs books,
records, and accounts. Tyco thereby violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)]. As reflected in this Complaint, numerous Tyco subsidiaries engaged in
violative conduct, the conduct was carried out by several different methods, and the conduct
occurred over a lengthy period of time and continued even after the 2006 injunction.

7. Through one of the illicit payment schemes, Tyco violated the FCPA anti-bribery
provisions. Specifically, through the acts of its then-subsidiary and agent, TE M/A-COM, Inc.,
Tyco violated Section 30A(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-l(a)] by corruptly making
illicit payments to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78aa]. Tyco, directly or indirectly, made use of
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national
securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business
alleged in this Complaint.

9. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

DEFENDANT

10. Tyco is incorporated in Switzerland and has its principal place of business in

Switzerland. It issues and maintains a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of

the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78/] that trades on the New York Stock Exchange. It is required
to file periodic reports with the Commission under Section 13 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§
78m].

STATEMENT OF FACTS

22. Tyco isa diversified global manufacturing company with operations around the
world. Starting in or about 1998 and continuing through at least 2009, the business of Tyco and
its subsidiaries took place in, among others, the Peopleâs Republic of China, India, Thailand,
Croatia, Serbia, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Mauritania, the Congo,
Niger, Madagascar, Turkey, Poland, Malaysia, and Egypt.

M/A-COM â Turkey

23. M/A-COM, through its SIGINT Products business unit, retained a New York
City-based sales agent who made illicit payments in connection with a September 2006 sale of
microwave equipment to an instrumentality of the Turkish government. The agent, who was
contractually designated as M/A-COMâs sales agent for Turkey, sold the equipment to the entity

controlled by Turkey at a mark-up over the M/A-COM invoice price. The microwave receivers
were shipped from Hunt Valley, Maryland to the agent in New York, who then shipped them to
Turkey via New York, New York.

24. | Employees of M/A-COM were aware that the agent was paying foreign
government customers to obtain orders. One internal e-mail stated, âHell, everyone knows you
have to bribe somebody to do business in Turkey. Nevertheless, I'll play it dumb if [M/A-
COMâs agent] should call.â

25. | Tyco exerted control over M/A-COM in part by utilizing dual roles for its
officers. At the time of the September 2006 transaction, four high-level Tyco officers were also
officers of M/A-COM, including one who was M/A-COMâs president. Additionally, one of
those Tyco officers served as one of five members of M/A-COMâs board of directors. While
there 1s no indication that any of these individuals knew of the illegal conduct described herein,
through the corporate structure used to hold M/A-COM and through the dual roles of these
officers, Tyco controlled M/A-COM. Asa result, M/A-COM was Tycoâs agent for purposes of
the September 2006 transaction, and the transaction was squarely within the scope of M/A-
COMâs agency.

26. The benefit obtained by Tyco as a result of the September 2006 deal was $44,513.

TTC China â Ministry of Public Security

27. In or about June 2005, TTC China signed a contract with the Chinese Ministry of
Public Security for $770,000, but reportedly paid approximately $3,700 to the âsite project teamâ
of a state-owned corporation to obtain the contract. This amount was improperly recorded in
TTC Chinaâs books and records as a commission, when in fact part of that amount was passed
along to the end-user. TTC Chinaâs financial results were incorporated in Tycoâs publicly filed

financial statements. Tycoâs benefit as a result of these illicit payments was $192,500.
TWW Germany

28. Â© TWW Germany and/or its agents failed to enact and/or follow policies governing
the retention and payment of third-party agents/distributors.

29. | TWW Germany and/or its agents paid or promised to pay third parties to secure
contracts or avoid penalties or fines in several countries: the Peopleâs Republic of China,
Croatia, India, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates. The payments
were ostensibly booked as commissions and in a manner that did not reflect the ultimate
recipients of the funds. The payments related to projects ongoing from October 2004 to 2009.
In fact the payments were not commissions, but were used to pay employees of government
customers and for other purposes. These entries were consolidated within Tyco and, as a result,
caused Tycoâs books and records to be misstated. Tycoâs benefit as a result of these illicit
payments was $4,684,966.

TFIS France

30. | TFIS France and/or its agents made payments to individuals from 2005 to 2009
for âbusiness introduction services.â One of the individuals receiving payments was a security
officer at a government-owned mining company in Mauritania, and a substantial amount of the
payments made before 2007 ultimately were deposited in that government officialâs personal
bank account in France. These payments were not supported by written contracts or invoices and
were not accurately recorded in TFIS Franceâs books and records. In addition, TFIS France
and/or its agents paid sham âcommissionsâ to approximately twelve other intermediaries in four
countries (Mauritania, the Congo, Niger, and Madagascar). The inaccurate entries were
incorporated into Tycoâs books and records. Tycoâs benefit as a result of these illicit payments

was $1,256,389.
TFC HK and Keystone â China

31. | TFC HK and Keystone failed to follow Tycoâs internal control policies and
procedures governing the retention and payment of third-party agents/distributors. TFC HK and
Keystone also failed to maintain an appropriate system to ensure accuracy in its books and
records regarding payments to sales agents and distributors.

32. Between 2005 and August 2006, THC HK and Keystone paid approximately
$246,000 to an agent in connection with sales to a large, government-owned Chinese
petrochemical company, although Tyco is unable to ascertain what, if any, legitimate services
were performed by the agent. As a result, Tycoâs books and records were misstated. Tycoâs
benefit as a result of these illicit payments was $181,504.

33. | TFC HK and Keystone also had other improper arrangements with agents.
Approximately $137,000 was paid to agencies owned by approximately eight Keystone sales
employees in 2005 and 2006, and those employees in turn transferred some portion of that
amount in cash or gifts to government officials, including design institutes, in the Peopleâs
Republic of China. The amounts in question were incorrectly recorded as proper commissions to
hide the fact that the payments were made to companies owned by Keystone employees. Asa
result, Tycoâs books and records were misstated. Tycoâs benefit as a result of these illicit
payments was $196,584.

ADT Thailand â CCTV

34. From in or about 2000 to in or about 2006, ADT Thailand maintained inaccurate
books and records in connection with multiple transactions and failed to implement policies to

ensure accurate record-keeping.
35. In connection with a contract to install a CCTV system in the Thai Parliament
House in 2006, ADT Thailand paid over $50,000 to a Thai entity that acted as a consultant. The
invoice related to this payment refers to ârenovation work,â but Tyco is unable to ascertain what,
if any, work was done. As a result, Tycoâs books and records were misstated. Tycoâs benefit as
a result of these illicit payments was $104,117.

TFS Malaysia

36. | From 2000 to 2007, TFS Malaysia used intermediaries to pay the employees of its
customers when bidding on contracts. Payments were made to approximately twenty-six
employees of customers, and one of those payees was an employee of a government-controlled
entity. TFS Malaysia inaccurately described these expenses as âcommissionsâ and failed to
maintain policies sufficient to prohibit such payments. As a result, Tycoâs books and records
were misstated. Tycoâs benefit as a result of these illicit payments was $45,972.

TFIS UK â Egypt

37. | From in or about 2004 to in or about 2008, an Egyptian agent of TFIS UK wired
approximately $282,022 to a former employeeâs personal bank account with the understanding
that the money would be used in connection with entertainment expenses for representatives of a
company majority-owned by the Egyptian government. A portion of the funds was used to pay
for lodging, meals, transportation, spending money, and entertainment expenses for that
companyâs officials on two trips to the United Kingdom in 2005 and 2006 and two trips to the
United States in 2007 and 2008.

38. TFIS UK made payments pursuant to inflated invoices submitted by the
companyâs Egyptian agent, who wired funds to the former employees to be used to entertain

foreign officials.

10
39. | TFIS UKâs books and records did not accurately reflect TFIS UKâs understanding
that the funds would be used for entertainment of government officials, and TFIS UK did not
maintain sufficient internal controls over its payments to agents. As a result, Tycoâs books and
records were misstated.

40.  Tycoâs benefit as a result of these illicit payments was $1,589,374.

THC Saudi Arabia

41. Beginning in or about December 2000 and continuing into at least June 2006,
THC Saudi Arabiaâs distributor in Saudi Arabia used a âcontrol accountâ to make payments at
THC Saudi Arabiaâs direction to doctors and hospital officials in Saudi Arabia, including those
employed by agencies or instrumentalities of the Saudi government. The control account was
not a bank account, but rather a general ledger account.

42. | While some disbursements from the control account were used for legitimate
expenses, several items were booked improperly as âpromotional expensesâ and âsales
developmentâ expenses. As a result, Tycoâs books and records were misstated. In connection
with the transactions related to these inaccurate books and records, Tycoâs benefit was
approximately $1,900,600.

THC China

43. From in or about September 2004 to in or about January 2007, employees of THC
China submitted approximately 33 expense claims related to entertainment of public healthcare
officials of the Peopleâs Republic of China. THC China then reimbursed those expenses. Some
of the expenses were supported by fictitious receipts, including references to a non-existent

company. In connection with the expenses, at least one THC China employee forged receipts

11
and applied a âsealâ for a bogus company. Employees forged receipts because the actual
expenditures were prohibited under Tycoâs internal guidelines.

44. From 2001 to 2008, THC China employees submitted false itineraries and other
documentation that did not properly identify travel expenses incurred in connection with medical
conferences. The inaccurate recordkeeping related to payment by THC China for trips or
portions of trips for publicly employed doctors in the Peopleâs Republic. As a result, Tycoâs
books and records were misstated.

45. In connection with the transactions related to these inaccurate books and records,
Tycoâs benefit was approximately $353,800.

THC Polska

46. â From in or about January 2005 to in or about December 2007, THC Polska used
âservice contractsâ to hire public healthcare professionals in Poland for various purposes,
including conducting training sessions, performing clinical studies, and distributing marketing
materials. Approximately five such service contracts involved falsified records and
approximately twenty-six other service contracts involved incomplete and inaccurate records,
including some related expenses paid by THC Polska to family members of healthcare
professionals. As a result, Tycoâs books and records were misstated. In connection with the
transactions related to these inaccurate books and records, Tycoâs benefit was approximately
$14,673.

SEC Charges Tyco for Illicit Payments to Foreign Officials

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-196

Washington, D.C., Sept. 24, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Tyco International Ltd. with violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when subsidiaries arranged illicit payments to foreign officials in more than a dozen countries.

The SEC alleges that subsidiaries of the Swiss-based global manufacturer perpetuated schemes that typically involved payments of fake
âcommissionsâ or the use of third-party agents to funnel money improperly to obtain lucrative contracts. Overall, Tyco reaped illicit benefits
amounting to more than $10.5 million as a result of the paid to win business.

Tyco, whose securities are publicly traded in the U.S., agreed to pay more than $26 million to settle the SECâs charges and resolve a criminal
matter announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âTycoâs subsidiaries operating in Asia and the Middle East saw illicit payment schemes as a typical way of doing business in some countries,
and the company illicitly reaped substantial financial benefits as a result,â said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of
Enforcement.

The SEC alleges that Tyco subsidiaries operated 12 different illicit payment schemes around the world starting before 2006 and continuing
until 2009. The most profitable scheme occurred in Germany, where agents of a Tyco subsidiary paid third parties to secure contracts or
avoid penalties or fines in several countries. These payments were falsely recorded as âcommissionsâ in Tycoâs books and records when they
were in fact bribes to pay off government customers. Tycoâs benefit as a result of these illicit payments was more than $4.6 million.

According to the SECâs complaint, Tycoâs subsidiary in China signed a contract with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security for $770,000 but
reportedly paid approximately $3,700 to the âsite project teamâ of a state-owned corporation to be able to obtain the contract. This amount
was improperly recorded as a commission. Tycoâs subsidiary in France recorded payments to individuals from 2005 to 2009 for âbusiness
introduction services.â However, one of the individuals receiving payments was a security officer at a government-owned mining company in
Mauritania, and many of the earlier payments were deposited in the officialâs personal bank account in France. In Thailand, Tycoâs subsidiary
had a contract to install a CCTV system in the Thai Parliament House in 2006, and paid more than $50,000 to a Thai entity that acted as a
consultant. The invoice for the payment refers to ârenovation work,â but Tyco is unable to ascertain what, if any, work was actually done.

The SEC alleges that another scheme occurred in Turkey, where Tycoâs subsidiary retained a New York City-based sales agent who made
illicit payments involving the sale of microwave equipment in September 2006 to an entity controlled by the Turkish government. Employees
at Tycoâs subsidiary were well aware that the agent was paying foreign government customers to obtain orders. One internal e-mail stated,
âHell, everyone knows you have to bribe somebody to do business in Turkey. Nevertheless, I'll play it dumb if [the sales agent] should call.â
The benefit obtained by Tyco as a result of the September 2006 deal was $44,513.

The SECâs complaint alleges that Tycoâs books and records were misstated as a result of the misconduct, and Tyco failed to devise and
maintain internal controls sufficient to detect the violations. The complaint also alleges that the payments by the sales agent to Turkish
government officials violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.

In arriving at the settlement, the Commission considered Tycoâs extensive efforts to identify and remediate its wrongdoing. Tyco conducted a
global review and internal investigation for potential FCPA violations and voluntarily disclosed its findings to the SEC while implementing
significant, broad-spectrum remedial measures. Tyco consented to a proposed final judgment that orders the company to pay $10,564,992 in
disgorgement and $2,566,517 in prejudgment interest. Tyco also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 13(b)(2)(A),
Section 13(b)(2)(B), and Section 30A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In the parallel criminal proceedings, the Justice Department entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Tyco in which the company will
pay a penalty of approximately $13.68 million.

The SECâs case was investigated by David Frohlich, Stephen E. Jones, Matthew B. Greiner, and Brent S. Mitchell. The Commission
acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section in this matter.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This matter concerns violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(""FCPA"") by Smith & Nephew plc (âS&N plcâ) through its subsidiaries to obtain sales
for their medical device business.

| 2. S&N plc is a global medical company with operations around the world.
From 1997 to June 2008, two of SKN plcâs subsidiaries engaged in a scheme with a
distributor who made illicit payments to public doctors employed by government
âhospitals or agencies in Greece.

3. S&N plc, through its subsidiaries, violated Section 30A of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] by making illicit

payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. S&N plc
violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have an adequate internal
control system in place to detect and prevent the illicit payments. S&N plc violated
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording these payments in its
accounting books and records.
JURISDICTION
4, This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. S&N plc, directly

9. Greek Distributor, based in Athens, Greece, was two individuals who
operated as agents and distributors for S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH for sales in Greece.
Greek Distributor operated Greek companies and three private companies based in the
United Kingdom, Company A, B, and C.

10. Vice President International Sales, a U.S. citizen, was Vice President for

Inc. in 2004. |

11. Greece Sales Manager, a U.S. citizen, was the sales manager for S&N
Inc.âs sales in Greece. He was based in Memphis, Tennessee and stopped working for
S&N Inc. around September 2003.

FACTS
12. S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH sold orthopedic products in Greece since the

1970s through the Greek Distributor. Greece has a national health care system wherein
most Greek hospitals are publicly-owned and operated. Healthcare providers, including
doctors, who work at publicly-owned hospitals are government employees, providing
healthcare services in their official capacities. The public doctors in Greece are âforeign
officialsâ as that term is defined in the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

13. From the 1970s until the late-1990s, S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH had an
agreement with the Greek Distributor to sell orthopedic products to the Greek Distributor
entities at a discount from âlistâ price. The Greek Distributor would re-sell the products
to Greek public hospitals at the full âlistâ price and the Greek Distributor entities would
make a profit.

14. Starting in 1997, a scheme was developed to create an offshore fund to
make payments to public doctors to purchase S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH products in
Greece. The Greek Distributor set up two shell companies in the United Kingdom,
Company A and Company B. The Greek Distributor negotiated a series of deals in which |
the Greek Distributor purchased orthopedic products from S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH at
full âlistâ price, but S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH then paid a percentage of those purchases
to the Greek Distributorâs offshore companies. Specifically, S&N Inc. entered into an
agreement in 1998 with Company A, and S&N GmbH entered into an agreement in 1998
with Company B. In 2003, S&N Inc. shifted its agreement to Company B as well.

15. On paper, it appeared as if S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH were paying
Company A and Company B for marketing services, but no true services were actually
performed. Company A and Company B were essentially receiving the portion of the
sales to the Greek Distributor entities that represented the difference between the list

price and the discount price normally paid by distributors, usually between 25 and 40
percent of sales. This had the effect of creating off-shore funds for the Greek Distributor
entities that were not subject to Greek taxes and that would be used to pay bribes to
public doctors to purchase S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH products.

16. | Throughout the period, S&N Inc. executives and S&N GmbH employees
understood that the Greek Distributor was paying bribes to public doctors in Greece by
using the funds paid to Company A and Company B. In October 1999, one of the Greek
Distributorâs employees sent an email to the Greek Sales Manager in Memphis asking for
S&N Inc. to pay a Company A invoice, noting that âWe have many outstanding
payments to surgeons and I would appreciate your help if this payment can be made to
[Company A] by the end of next week at the very latest.â

17. In late fall 1999, S&N Incâs Chief Financial Officer raised questions with
S&N lawyers following questions from internal auditors concerning the payments to the
Greek Distributorâs UK Companies. On November 9, 1999, Greece Sales Manager and
an S&N Inc. attorney met to discuss issues with S&N GmbHâs agreement with the Greek
Distributor. The notes of the S&N Inc. attorney who attended the meeting stated: âPay
surgeon to use prod â Not legal or ethic; but universal. S&N will not do.â On November _
17, 1999, the same S&N Inc. attorney then briefed a more-senior SKN Inc. attorney on
the issue, noting that.the Greek Distributor was receiving âpromotion supportâ from S&N
GmbH, that Memphis was doing the same thing, and that no services were received in
exchange. The notes of the meeting by the more-senior attorney also reflected that:
âDistributor in Greece pays docs to use our products.â

18. In January 2001, S&N Inc. renewed its contract with Company A.
19. In February 2002, the Greek Distributor traveled to Memphis to meet with

Vice President International Sales and others concerning certain proposed reductions in
the percentage paid to Company A. In March 2002, the Greek Distributor sent an email _
to Greece Sales Manager and Vice President International Sales in the United States that
explicitly said he was paying doctors for purchasing S&N Inc. products (emphasis in
original):

The [Company A] commission cannot be reduced for the time being, since it

is already not sufficient to cover my companyâs cash incentive requirements at

the current market level, with major competitors paying 30-40% more than
[the Greek Distributor].

As I explained to you in Memphis (as well as during your last visit to Athens)
I absolutely need this fund to promote my sales with surgeons, at a time
when competition offers substantially higher rates.

[Company A]âs only reason for being is the need for cash incentives, a real
pain in the neck but unavoidable fact of Greek life.

In case it is not clear to you, please understand that I am paying cash
incentives right after each surgery . . .

S&N Inc. did not reduce the commissions.

20. Company A. was also used by another medical device company to pay
bribes to public doctors in Greece.

21. S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH recorded the payments to Company A and -
Company B as legitimate marketing expenses in their books and records when a portion
of those payments were used to pay bribes.

22. During 2004, Vice President International Sales left the company.

23. In 2004, S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH reconsidered their arrangement with
the Greek Distributor after foreign tax authorities questioned S&N GmbHâs deduction of

certain expenses. As a result, starting in 2005, S&N Inc. sold its products to Company C,
another offshore company controlled by the Greek Distributor, at a standard discount off
of list price. Company C then sold the products to the Greek Distributor, which sold them
in Greece. Similar to Company A and Company B, Company C also acted as an offshore
fund to make bribe payments to public doctors in Greece. Starting in 2005, S&N GmbH
discontinued dealings with the Greek Distributor.

24. In May 2005, the Greek Distributor met with an S&N Inc. representative,
who informed the Greek Distributor that it could not make payments to doctors, and that
Greek Distributor would have to produce to S&N a marketing plan. However, no further
steps were taken to ensure that the Greek Distributor was not making payments to public
doctors in Greece.

25. In June 2007, S&N plc acquired a new subsidiary, a private Swiss
company that sold orthopedic products in Greece. S&N plc intended to use the new
subsidiary to sell its products in Greece rather than use the Greek Distributor. The Greek
Distributor tried to maintain the relationship and, in trying to convince an S&N Inc.
executive of his value, the Greek Distributor said that he paid surgeons less than the
payments to surgeons made by the newly acquired subsidiary. S&N plc did later learn
that the newly acquired subsidiary had engaged in unacceptable sales practices prior to its
acquisition.

26. The deal between S&N Inc. and Company C expired in 2007. âHowever,
S&N Inc. continued to sell products to the Greek Distributor to fulfill long-term contracts
with Greek hospitals. S&N Inc. ended its sales of orthopedic products to the Greek

Distributor entities in June 2008.
A. Anti-Bribery Violations |

27. S&N plcâs subsidiaries S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH knowingly allowed the
Greek Distributor to pay Greek public doctors for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business.

28. | S&N Inc. employees who were U.S. nationals approved the arrangements
with the Greek Distributor that included payments to doctors. The mails and â
instrumentalities of interstate commerce were used in furtherance of this bribery scheme.

B. Failure to Maintain Its Books and Records

29. S&N plcâs subsidiaries S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH characterized their
payments to Company A and Company B as being for âcommissionsâ and marketing
services even though those payments were used by the Greek Distributor to pay bribes to
Greek doctors. S&N plcâs books and records did not reflect the true nature of those
payments. For example, they did not reflect that a portion of the payments to the Greek
Distributor constituted reimbursements for bribes. S&N Inc. also mischaracterized the
nature of the sales to Company C.

Cc. Failure to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

30. S&N plc failed to implement adequate internal controls to detect or
prevent bribery. The conduct involved employees and managers of several levels at two
subsidiaries.

31... S&N ple failed to implement, either directly or through its subsidiaries,
adequate internal controls to prevent the bribery or to ensure that transactions were
recorded properly, as follows. S&N plc failed to act on numerous red flags of bribery.

Among other things, even though S&N ple was aware that S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH
were conducting business in Greece and was aware of the heightened risks of the Greek
market, S&N plc did not require proof of services rendered by Company A and Company
B. S&N plc failed to question the reasons for paying the Greek Distributor for Greek
sales to accounts in the names of entities located outside of Greece. S&N plc failed to
conduct due diligence on Company A and Company B. S&N plc also failed to conduct
any audits of the transactions.

SEC Charges Smith & Nephew PLC with Foreign Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-25

Washington, D.C., Feb. 6, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged London-based medical device company Smith &
Nephew PLC with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its U.S. and German subsidiaries bribed public doctors in Greece for
more than a decade to win business.

Smith & Nephew PLC and its U.S. subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc. agreed to pay more than $22 million in agreements with the SEC and U.S.
Department of Justice. The charges stem from the SECâs and DOJâs ongoing proactive global investigation of bribery of publicly-employed
physicians by medical device companies.

The SECâs complaint against Smith & Nephew PLC alleges that its subsidiaries used a distributor to create a slush fund to make illicit
payments to public doctors employed by government hospitals or agencies in Greece. On paper, it appeared as though Smith & Nephewâs
subsidiaries were paying for marketing services, but no services were actually performed. The scheme basically created off-shore funds that
were not subject to Greek taxes to pay bribes to public doctors to purchase Smith & Nephew products.

âSmith & Nephewâs subsidiaries chose a path of corruption rather than fair and honest competition,â said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of
the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. âThe SEC will continue to hold companies liable as we investigate the
medical device industry for this type of illegal behavior.â

According to the SECâs complaint against Smith & Nephew PLC filed in federal court in Washington D.C., U.S. subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc.
and German subsidiary Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics GmbH has sold orthopedic products in Greece since the 1970s through the Greek
distributor. Greece has a national health care system in which most Greek hospitals are publicly-owned and operated, and doctors who work
at those publicly-owned hospitals are government employees and âforeign officialsâ as defined in the FCPA.

The SEC alleges that the misconduct began in 1997, when Smith & Nephewâs subsidiaries developed a scheme to make payments to three
Shell entities in the United Kingdom controlled by the distributor. Those funds were used by the distributor to pay bribes to the Greek doctors
on behalf of the Smith & Nephew subsidiaries. Smith & Nephew failed to act on numerous red flags of bribery as employees at the company
and its subsidiaries became aware of the payments. In one e-mail exchange between employees at the U.S. subsidiary and the distributor
concerning whether to reduce the distributor's commissions, the distributor stated, â... In case it is not clear to you, please understand that |
am paying cash incentives right after each surgery...â Smith & Nephew Inc. determined not to reduce the commissions.

Smith & Nephew PLC agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying more than $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Its
subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc. agreed to pay a $16.8 million fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of
Justice. Smith & Nephew PLC consented without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, to the entry of a court order permanently
enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering it to
retain an independent compliance monitor for a period of 18 months to review its FCPA compliance program.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Tracy L. Price of the Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit along with Brent S. Mitchell and Reid A.
Muoio. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
SECâs investigation into the medical device industry is continuing.

SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
ALLIANZ SE, EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER AND CIVIL
PENALTY

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Allianz SE (âAllianzâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferââ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over the Respondent and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order And Civil Penalty (âOrderââ), as set
forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds' that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise out of violations of the books and records and internal
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAââ) by Allianz SE (âAllianzâ or
the âCompanyââ), through its Indonesian majority-owned subsidiary, PT Asuransi Allianz Utama
(âUtamaâ). Between 2001 and 2008, Utama managers made improper payments to employees of
state-owned entities in Indonesia in order to obtain and retain business. Allianz learned of the
improper payments from two complaints made several years apart. The first complaint was
submitted in 2005 alleging significant misconduct, including unsupported payments to agents. A
subsequent audit of Utamaâs accounting records uncovered that managers at Utama were using
âspecial purpose accountsâ to make illicit payments, many to government officials, in order to
secure business in Indonesia. Despite the audit, the conduct continued. The second complaint
was lodged in 2009 to Allianzâs external auditors and alleged that Allianz created illicit off-the-
books accounts. In response, Allianz began an internal investigation. The Commission staff
opened an investigation in April 2010 after receiving an anonymous complaint of possible FCPA
violations. The investigation determined that from at least 2001 through December 2008, the
Utama managers, with the assistance of others in the Indonesian office, made payments to
employees of state-owned entities in Indonesia to procure or retain insurance contracts related to
large government projects in Indonesia. As a result of improper payments of approximately
$650,626 to agents and employees of state-owned entities and others, Allianz realized
$5,315,649 in profits.

2. The payments were improperly recorded as legitimate transaction costs, thereby
causing Allianzâs books and records to be inaccurate. Allianz failed to devise and maintain a
system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances to detect and prevent such
payments.

Respondent

3. Allianz SE (âAllianzâ) was founded in 1890 and is headquartered in Munich,
Germany. Allianz and its subsidiaries primarily engage in property and casualty insurance, life
and health insurance, and asset management businesses worldwide. The Company operates in
70 countries, has 150,000 employees and in fiscal year 2011, the Company reported revenue of
103.6 billion euro. From November 3, 2000 to October 23, 2009, Allianzâs American
Depositary Shares and bonds were registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of
the Exchange Act and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ). As such, Allianz
was an âissuerâ within the meaning of the FCPA. The conduct at issue occurred when Allianz
was a U.S. issuer. On October 23, 2009, Allianz voluntarily delisted its securities from the

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
NYSE and soon thereafter terminated its reporting obligations with the Commission. The
Company also delisted its ordinary shares from the London, Milan, Paris, and Swiss stock
exchanges. Presently, Allianzâs shares trade only on German stock exchanges.

Facts

11. In 1981, Allianz commenced its operations in Indonesia with a representative
office that provided financing and insurance for large government projects in Indonesia.
Simultaneous with the opening of the office, Allianz opened a special purpose bank account with
a local Indonesian broker. From 1981 to 1989, the account was used to pay legitimate
commissions to the local Indonesian broker for business it generated for Allianz. In 1989,
Allianz established Utama and continued the practice of using special purpose accounts for
paying commissions to agents that generated business for Allianz. However, in February 2001,
Indonesian Agent, an agent for Utama, Utama CEO | and Utamaâs Chief Financial Officer
(âCFOâ) opened a separate, off-the-books account in the Indonesian Agentâs name (the âAgent
special purpose accountâ). The Agent special purpose account was used to make improper
payments to employees of Indonesian state-owned entities and others for the purpose of
obtaining and retaining insurance contracts. In February 2001, Indonesian Agent and Utama
CEO | executed a âPaying Agency Agreementâ that set up the scheme to make the payments to
employees of state-owned entities. This agreement established the off-the-books account that
served as a slush fund to make bribe payments to foreign officials and others as instructed by
Utama.

A. Utamaâs 2001-2005 Improper Payments

12. During the period 2001 to 2005, Utama Marketing Manager made payments from
the Agent special purpose account to account introducers employed by state-owned entities to
secure insurance contracts on large government projects in Indonesia.â Utama Marketing
Manager received approval from Utama management to use the Agent special purpose account
for improper purposes. Utama CEO 2, the CEO from 2003-2006, was aware of the Agent special
purpose account and the improper payments to foreign officials.

13. The improper payments made to foreign officials were disguised in the Utama
insurance contracts as âoverriding commissions.â Each insurance contract outlined two parts of
the overall insurance premium: the technical premium (the actual cost of the coverage), which
was usually 75-95% of the premium, and the non-technical premium (the overriding
commission), which was typically 5-25% of the premium. The overriding commission was the
portion that was paid to the foreign official as an inducement to purchase the Utama insurance
product. Once the entire premium was deposited in the Utama bank account and booked in
Utamaâs internal accounting system, Utama Marketing Manager would submit a âcommission
payment requestâ to the finance department. Once the request was approved the overriding
commission portion was transferred to the Agent special purpose account. Utama Marketing
Manager would withdraw the commission in cash from the Agent special purpose account and
deliver the funds to the foreign official. Despite the fact that Allianz has a majority share of
Utama and consolidated the subsidiaryâs accounts into its own books and records, Utamaâs
accounting system was maintained in Indonesia and Allianz did not have effective controls over

 

Â° Most of the account introducers were foreign officials because they were employees of Indonesian state-

owned entities, who acted in their official government capacity to procure or retain insurance contracts from Allianz
on government projects.

the accounting. Allianz did not have the ability to access Utamaâs accounting system and,
therefore, did not detect the movement of funds to the Agent special purpose account. In
addition, the Agent special purpose account was maintained in the name of the Indonesian Agent
to make it appear that all movement of funds to this account was for legitimate commission
payments. Likewise, Allianz did not have effective controls over the commission payment
request process, which allowed payments to go to the Agent special purpose account without
supporting documentation.

14. On December 1, 2005, a whistleblower complaint concerning the special purpose
account was submitted to both the Allianz whistleblower hotline and Utamaâs joint venture
partner Jasindo, and then forwarded to the head of AZAP. The complaint itemized a number of
control weaknesses, most notably, the existence of the Agent special purpose account and its lack
of transparency. On December 8, 2005, Allianz Group Audit initiated an audit of the Indonesian
office; however, the review was limited to embezzlement from the Company. The audit
identified the Agent special purpose account as an account mainly used by Utama Marketing
Manager as a âvehicle to pay project development and overriding commissions to the special
projects and clients for securing business with Utama.â It also identified two internal accounts
related to the Indonesian Agent; one for the agentâs normal commissions, and one for âvariousâ
purposes. However, no additional steps were taken to determine the nature and purpose of the
accounts or to identify the recipients of payments from the accounts. On December 12, 2005,
based on the audit findings Allianz directed the Utama management to close the Agent special
purpose account. Although the Utama management agreed to close the account and to stop
making the payments, it continued making improper payments to secure business for Allianz
through 2008.

B. Utamaâs Post-2005 Improper Payments

15. Despite the directive to close the account and to stop making payments, Utama
Marketing Manager continued to use the Agent special purpose account to make improper
payments to foreign officials from 2005 to 2008. In an email dated May 20, 2006, the Utama
Chief Technical Officer emailed Utama Marketing Manager and Utama CEO 2 that the finance
department had detected that the Agent special purpose account had been used to make payments
in connection with two government insurance contracts. Utama Marketing Manager
acknowledged that he used the Agent special purpose account to make the payments because the
account introducers expected to receive the promised improper payments on the government
insurance contracts. Utama CEO 2 approved the continued use of the Agent special purpose
account to make payments on the two government insurance contracts at issue. Later, Utama
Marketing Manager and his staff expanded the improper payments to numerous other foreign
officials on government insurance contracts.

16. From 2005 to 2008, Utama Marketing Manager employed various methods to
make payments to foreign officials. In addition to booking payments through the Agent special
purpose account, Utama Marketing Manager made payments by either: 1) booking commissions
to an agent that was not associated with the account for the government insurance contract and
then withdrawing the funds booked to the agentâs account as cash to pay the foreign official; or
2) overstating the amount of a clientâs insurance premium, booking the excess amount to an

5
unallocated account and then âreimbursingâ the excess funds to the foreign officials, who were
responsible for procuring the government insurance contracts.

17. Similar to the Agent special purpose account, Allianz did not have effective
controls over the Utama accounting system or the commission payment process, which allowed
payments to be made to an agentâs account without supporting documentation. Allianz did not
have any controls over the use of the unallocated account that was maintained at Utama. As a
result, Utama Marketing Manager was able to take funds from Utama to pay foreign officials
without detection. In March 2009, Allianzâs outside auditor received an anonymous complaint
alleging that an Allianz executive created or initiated slush funds during his tenure with AZAP.
Between December 2005, when the Allianz Executive Vice-President of the Asia-Pacific
Division directed Utama to close the Agent special purpose account and the March 2009
Whistleblower complaint, Allianz took no steps to ensure that the Agent special purpose account
was closed and that similar improper payments were not being made.

Cc. Investigation and Remediation

18. In response to the March 2009 Whistleblower complaint, Allianz convened a
Whistleblower Committee to do an internal investigation and retained counsel to conduct an
internal investigation of Utamaâs payment practices in Indonesia. Allianz did not report the
conduct to the Commission staff.

19. In April 2010, the staff opened an investigation after receiving an anonymous
complaint of possible FCPA violations. The staff contacted Allianz concerning the allegations.
Allianzâs cooperation in the staff's investigation and the timeliness of its response to the
Commissionâs requests for documents and information improved over time. Allianz hired new
counsel and took steps to further its cooperation and remedial efforts.

20. The staffâs investigation uncovered 295 government insurance contracts that were
obtained or retained by improper payments of approximately $650,626 to Indonesian
government officials and others from 2001 through 2008. As stated above, in some instances the
nature of the improper payments was disguised in invoices as an âoverriding commissionâ or as
a commission for an agent that was not associated with the government insurance contract. In
other instances the improper payments were structured as an overpayment by the government
insurance contract holder, who was later âreimbursedâ for the overpayment. The excess funds
were then paid to foreign officials, who were responsible for procuring the government insurance
contracts.*

21. Allianz took various remedial measures, including employment action against
several individuals who were involved in the conduct or failed to stop the conduct. Allianz
issued new or enhanced FCPA compliance and internal accounting control policies and
procedures, including mandating strict scrutiny of payments to third party intermediaries.
Allianz also updated the anti-corruption clause in its third-party contracts to specifically refer to

 

4 In late 2010, Allianz reported to the staff that Manroland, AG, an entity in which Allianz had invested in

through its private equity arm, was under investigation by German tax authorities. The German tax investigation
focused on the tax-deductibility of certain sales-related expenses, many of which occurred after Allianz ceased being
an issuer. None of the irregularities in payments involve government projects or payments to foreign officials.

the FCPA. Allianz provided enhanced FCPA compliance training to its employees and
improved its current global anti-corruption compliance program.

Legal Standards and Violations

22. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act of omission the person knew or
should have known would contribute to such violation.

FCPA Violations

23. The FCPA, enacted in 1977, added Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act to
require public companies to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.

24. The FCPA also added Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act to require public
companies to, among other things, devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions: (1) are executed in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; and (11) are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets. See
15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m (b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B). Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act does
not require that the amounts involved be âmaterial,â nor is it necessary to prove âscienterâ under
its provisions. SEC v. World-Wide Coin Invs. Ltd., 567 F. Supp. 724, 749-51 (N.D. Ga. 1983).
Similarly, there is no scienter requirement for establishing a violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B). Id.

25. Utama, a majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz, made improper payments to
foreign officials to obtain or retain government insurance contracts. Utama improperly recorded
the payments as legitimate transaction costs. Utamaâs financial statements were consolidated into
Allianzâs financial statements. As a result of the conduct described above, Allianz violated Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to keep accurate books, records and
accounts. Further, as evidenced by the extent and duration of Utamaâs improper payments and
their improper recordation, and the fact that Allianz was not aware that Utamaâs commission
payment request process allowed funds to be diverted for improper payments, Allianz failed to
recognize the compliance risks posed by Utama. Allianz also failed to devise and maintain an
effective system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that improper
payments were not being made by its subsidiary. As a result of the conduct described above,
Allianz violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to devise and
maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls.
Allianzâs Cooperation and Remedial Efforts

206. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered the cooperation
afforded the Commission staff and certain remedial measures undertaken by Allianz including
enhancements to its compliance program.

IV.

agreed to in Respondent Allianzâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

SEC Charges Germany-Based Allianz SE with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2012-266

Washington, D.C., Dec. 17, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Germany-based insurance and asset
management company Allianz SE with violating the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) for improper payments to government officials in Indonesia during a seven-year period.

The SECâs investigation uncovered 295 insurance contracts on large government projects that were obtained or retained by improper
payments of $650,626 by Allianzâs subsidiary in Indonesia to employees of state-owned entities. Allianz made more than $5.3 million in
profits as a result of the improper payments.

Allianz, which is headquartered in Munich, agreed to pay more than $12.3 million to settle the SECâs charges.

âAllianzâs subsidiary created an 'off-the-books' account that served as a slush fund for bribe payments to foreign officials to win insurance
contracts worth several million dollars,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings against Allianz, the misconduct occurred from 2001 to 2008 while
the companyâs shares and bonds were registered with the SEC and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Two complaints brought the
misconduct to Allianzâs attention. The first complaint submitted in 2005 reported unsupported payments to agents, and a subsequent audit of
accounting records at Allianzâs subsidiary in Indonesia uncovered that managers were using âspecial purpose accountsâ to make illegal
payments to government officials in order to secure business in Indonesia. The misconduct continued in spite of that audit.

According to the SECâs order, the second complaint was made to Allianzâs external auditor in 2009. Allianz failed to properly account for
certain payments in their books and records. The improper payments were disguised in invoices as an âoverriding commissionâ for an agent
that was not associated with the government insurance contract. In other instances, the improper payments were structured as an
overpayment by the government insurance contract holder, who was later âreimbursedâ for the overpayment. Excess funds were then paid to
foreign officials who were responsible for procuring the government insurance contracts. Allianz lacked sufficient internal controls to detect
and prevent the wrongful payments and improper accounting.

The SECâs order found that Allianz violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, specifically Sections 13(b)(2)
(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Allianz agreed to cease and desist from
further violations and pay disgorgement of $5,315,649, prejudgment interest of $1,765,125, and a penalty of $5,315,649 for a total of
$12,396,423.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Irene Gutierrez, Jennifer Baskin and Tracy L. Price of the FCPA Unit.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

 

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, :

100 F Street, N.E. :
Washington, D.C. 20549, :
Plaintiff, Civil Action No.
v. COMPLAINT
ELI LILLY AND COMPANY,
Defendant.

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows:
SUMMARY

1. Eli Lilly and Company (âLillyâ) violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (âFCPAâ) in connection with the activities of its subsidiaries in China, Brazil, Poland and
Russia.

2. Between 2006 and 2009, employees of Lillyâs China subsidiary falsified expense
reports in order to provide improper gifts and cash payments to government-employed
physicians. In 2007, a pharmaceutical distributor hired by Lilly in Brazil paid bribes to
government health officials in a Brazilian state in order to assure sales of a Lilly product to state
government institutions. In Poland, between 2000 and 2003, Lillyâs subsidiary made eight
payments totaling approximately $39,000 to a small charitable foundation that was founded and
administered by the head of one of the regional government health authorities at the same time

that the subsidiary was seeking the officialâs support for placing Lilly drugs on the government
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 2 of 20

reimbursement list. Finally, Lillyâs subsidiary in Russia paid millions of dollars to off-shore
entities for alleged âservicesâ beginning as early as 1994 and continuing through 2005 in order
for pharmaceutical distributors and government entities to purchase Lillyâs drugs. In some
instances, the off-shore entities appear to have been used to funnel money to government
officials or others with influence in the government in order to obtain business for the subsidiary.
These off-shore entities rarely provided the contracted-for services. Moreover, between 2005
and 2008, contemporaneous with requests to government officials to support the governmentâs
purchase or reimbursement of Lillyâs products, the subsidiary in Russia made proposals to
government officials about how the company could donate to, or otherwise support, various
initiatives that were affiliated with, or important to, the government officials.

3. As a result of this conduct, Lilly violated Sections 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)] by failing to have an
adequate internal controls system in place to detect and prevent illicit payments. Lilly violated
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)] by improperly recording each of
those payments in its accounting books and records. Lilly also violated Section 30A of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] in connection with certain activities of its subsidiary in
Russia. Unless restrained and enjoined by the Court, Lilly will continue to engage in acts and
practices that constitute, or will constitute, violations of these provisions.

JURISDICTION

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e)
and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. Lilly directly and indirectly
made use of the mails and of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in

connection with certain of the acts, practices and courses of business described in this Complaint.
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 3 of 20

Certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein occurred within
this District, and venue is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa]
or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

DEFENDANT

5. Eli Lilly and Company is an Indiana corporation with its headquarters located at
Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285. Lilly is a pharmaceutical manufacturer that
markets products in over 143 countries. Its common stock is registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol âLLY.â

6. Outside of the United States, Lilly sells its products, both directly and through
distributors or other intermediaries, to government-controlled entities, such as ministries of
health and government-owned hospitals and clinics.

FACTS
Poland

7. During 2000 through 2003, Lillyâs wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland (âLilly-
Polandâ) made eight payments totaling approximately $39,000 to the Chudow Castle Foundation
(âChudow Foundationâ), a small charitable foundation in Poland that was founded and
administered by the Director of the Silesian Health Fund (âDirectorâ). The Director established
the Chudow Foundation in 1995 to restore the Chudow Castle in the town of Chudow and other
historic sites in the Silesian region of Poland.

8. The Silesian Health Fund (âHealth Fundâ) was one of sixteen regional
government health authorities in Poland during the period. Among other things, the Health Fund

reimbursed hospitals and healthcare providers for the purchase of certain approved products.
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 4 of 20

The Health Fund, through the allocation of public money, exercised considerable influence over
which pharmaceutical products local hospitals and other healthcare providers in the region
purchased.

9. Beginning in early 2000 and into 2002, Lilly-Poland was in negotiations with the
Health Fund over, among other things, the Heath Fundâs financing of the purchase of Gemzar,
one of Lillyâs cancer drugs, by public hospitals and other healthcare providers. Those
negotiations occurred primarily between a team manager at Lilly-Poland (âLilly Managerâ) and
the Director. Continuing at intervals throughout these negotiations, the Director asked that Lilly-
Poland contribute to the Chudow Foundation. The initial request came directly from the Director
and the subsequent requests came from the Chudow Foundation.

10. The Lilly-Poland Manager knew that the Director had established the Chudow
Foundation and that it was a project to which he was devoted and lent much effort. The Manager
requested the approval of payments to the Chudow Foundation. The Manager falsely described
the first payment as being for the purchase of computers for the Chudow Foundation. The
second Lilly-Poland payment request falsely characterized the proposed payment as â[t]o support
foundation in its goal to develop activities in [Chudow Castle].â That request documentation
also noted that the âvalue of the requestâ was â[i]ndirect support of educational efforts of
foundation settled by Silesia [Health Fund].â Similarly, the remaining payments were
mischaracterized as monies paid by Lilly-Poland to secure the use of the Chudow Castle for
conferences after its renovation. No such conferences took place.

11. Lilly-Poland eventually made a total of eight payments to the Chudow

Foundation, starting in June 2000 and ending in January 2003. Lilly-Poland contributed 154,500
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 5 of 20

zlotys (PLN) (approximately $39,000) to the Chudow Foundation, as summarized in the table

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below.

Date Amount

June 21, 2000 12,000 PLN ($2,730)
November 13, 2000 8,500 PLN ($1,855)
May 22, 2001 32,000 PLN ($8,019)
November 5, 2001 10,000 PLN ($2,438)
March 27, 2002 32,000 PLN ($7,779)
June 14, 2002 30,000 PLN ($7,434)
November 20, 2002 20,000 PLN ($5,112)
January 29, 2003 10,000 PLN ($2,622)

 

12. The Manager requested the approval of the payments to the Chudow Foundation
with the intent of inducing the Health-Fund Director to allocate public monies to hospitals and
other healthcare providers in the Health Fund for the purpose of purchasing Gemzar. For
example, in February 2002, the Director, following a meeting with the Manager, authorized
financing a purchase of Gemzar. Two days later, the Chudow Foundation sent a letter to Lilly-
Poland requesting a payment of 32,000 PLN (which Lilly-Poland made on March 27, 2002). An
internal record at Lilly-Poland (a spreadsheet entitled âExpenses 2002â) reflects that this
payment to the Chudow Foundation was âfor [the Director].â

13.. Two Lilly-Poland emails also reflect the improper purpose of the payments to the
Chudow Foundation. Prior to the first payment, the Manager told another Lilly-Poland
employee in a May 31, 2000 email that the Health-Fund Director needed more convincing about
purchasing Gemzar. In that email, under the heading âSponsorships,â the Manager observed that
Lilly-Poland was to pay:

12,000 zlotys in two installments, not very far removed from each other, to the

Chudow Castle Foundation, [the Health Fund Directorâs] hobby, supposedly for

the purchase of computers. . . For your information regarding the size of the

budget for this year, I decided to invest 70-75% for Silesia. I have given [the
Health Fund Director] a free hand as to managing the Lilly investment,
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 6 of 20

emphasizing the fact we are only doing this for him . . . and we donât need the
publicity.

14. In a March 19, 2001 email to a Lilly-Poland colleague, the Manager noted that
one of the tasks was Lilly-Polandâs â[d]Jetermination of the amount of the rebate for the director
in connection with the âCastleâ Foundation.â In that email, when describing the budget, the
Manager wrote: âthe so-called rebate for the âCastleâ . . . will depend on the purchases of
medicines.â Accordingly, textual references in both emails â âsupposedly for the purchase of
computersâ and ââthe so-called rebate for the âCastleââ â underscore the Managerâs attempts to
create a pretext and false justifications for the payments to the Chudow Foundation.

15. The final seven payments to the Chudow Foundation were approved by the Lilly-
Poland âMedical Grant Committeeâ (âMGCâ), which included Lilly-Polandâs Managing
Director, Finance Director and Regulatory and Medical Director. The MGC approved the
payments based largely on the justification and description in the submitted paperwork. The
MGC procedures did not adequately analyze the circumstances outside the paperwork such as:
(i) the Chudow Foundation was a project founded and administered by a high-level government
health official who had significant authority over whether the Health Fund would pay for Lilly-
Poland products in Silesia, one of Polandâs most populous regions; (11) Lilly-Poland was in
negotiations to persuade the Director to finance the purchase of one of Lillyâs cancer products at
the time of the requests from the Chudow Foundation for payments; (iii) the justifications for the
first two payments were different from each other and different from the justification given for
the remaining six payments; (iv) the request for one of the largest payments came two days after
the Director had met with the Manager and agreed to authorize financing the purchase of a large

quantity of Gemzar by the Health Fund; and (v) the payments to the Chudow Foundation were
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12. Page 7 of 20

the only payments by Lilly-Poland to an archeological and/or restoration project, despite the
existence of numerous other such projects in Poland at the time.
China

16. Lillyâs wholly-owned subsidiary through which it does business in China (âLilly-
Chinaâ) employs more than one-thousand sales representatives whose main focus is on
marketing Lilly products to government-employed health-care providers. During the relevant
period, the sales representatives worked from regional offices and traveled throughout the
country, interacting with the health-care providers in order to convince them to prescribe Lilly
products. The sales representatives were directly supervised by District Sales Managers who, in
turn, were supervised by Regional Managers. Sales representatives paid out-of-pocket for their
travel expenses and submitted receipts and other documentation to the company for
reimbursement.

17. | Between 2006 and 2009, various sales representatives and their supervisors
abused the system by submitting, or instructing subordinates to submit, false expense reports. In
some instances, Lilly-China personnel used reimbursements from those false reports to purchase
gifts and entertainment for government-employed physicians in order to encourage the
physicians to look favorably upon Lilly and prescribe Lilly products.

18. In one sales area, in 2006 and 2007, a District Sales Manager for Lillyâs diabetes
products instructed subordinates to submit false expenses reports and provide the reimbursement
money to her. She then used the reimbursements to purchase gifts, such as wine, specialty foods
and a jade bracelet, for government-employed physicians. At least five sales representatives in
the oncology sales group submitted false expense reports and then used those reimbursements to

provide meals, visits to bath houses, and card games to government-employed physicians.
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 8 of 20

19. Similarly, in three other provinces, three sales representatives submitted false
expense reports and then used the reimbursements to provide government-employed physicians
with visits to bath houses and karaoke bars. In another city, five sales representatives submitted
false reimbursements and then their Regional Manager used the money to provide door prizes
and publication fees to government-employed physicians. In another city, seven sales
representatives and the District Sales Manager for the diabetes sales team used reimbursements
to buy meals and cosmetics for government-employed physicians.

20. Between 2008 and 2009, members of Lilly-Chinaâs âAccess Group,â which was
responsible for expanding access to Lilly products in China by, among other things, convincing
government officials to list Lilly products on government reimbursement lists, engaged in similar
misconduct. At least six members of the sixteen-member Access Group, including two associate
access directors, falsified expense reports and used the proceeds to provide gifts and
entertainment to government officials in China. The gifts included: spa treatments, meals, and
cigarettes.

21. Although the dollar amount of each gift was generally small, the improper
payments were wide-spread throughout the subsidiary. Lilly has terminated, or otherwise
disciplined, the various employees who submitted false expense reports and/or used the proceeds
to provide gifts and services to government officials.

Brazil

22. Between 2007 and 2009, Lilly-Brazil distributed drugs in Brazil through third-
party distributors who then resold those products to both private and government entities. As a
general rule, Lilly-Brazil sold the drugs to the distributors at a discount; the distributors then

resold the drugs to the end users at a higher price and took the discount as their compensation.
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 9 of 20

Lilly-Brazil negotiated the amount of the discount with the distributor based on the distributorâs
anticipated sale. The discount to the distributors generally ranged between 6.5% and 15%, with
the majority of distributors in Brazil receiving a 10% discount.

23. In early 2007, at the request of one of Lilly-Brazilâs sales and marketing
managers at the time, Lilly-Brazil granted a nationwide pharmaceutical distributor, unusually
large discounts of 17% and 19% for two of the distributorâs purchases of a Lilly drug, which the
distributor then sold to the government of one of the Brazilian states. Lilly-Brazilâs pricing
committee approved the discounts without further inquiry. The policies and procedures in place
to flag unusual distributor discounts were deficient. They relied on the representations of the
sales and marketing manager without adequate verification and analysis of the surrounding
circumstances of the transactions. In May 2007, Lilly sold 3,200 milligrams of the drug to the
distributor for resale to the Brazilian state; in August 2007, Lilly-Brazil sold 13,500 milligrams
of the drug to the distributor for resale to the Brazilian state. Together the sales were valued at
approximately $1.2 million.

24. The distributor used approximately 6% of the purchase price (approximately
$70,000) to bribe government officials from the Brazilian state so that the state would purchase
the Lilly product. The Lilly-Brazil sales and marketing manager who requested the discount

knew about this arrangement.

Russia
25. From 1994 through 2005, Lilly-Vostok, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lilly, sold
pharmaceutical products either directly to government entities in the former Soviet Union or
through various distributors, often selected by the government, who would then resell the

products to the government entities. Along with the underlying purchase contract with the
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 10 of 20

government entity or distributor, Lilly-Vostok sometimes entered into another agreement with a
third-party selected by a government official or by the government-chosen pharmaceutical
distributor. Generally, these third-parties, which had addresses and bank accounts located
outside of Russia, were paid a flat fee or a percentage of the sale. These agreements were
referred to as âmarketingâ or âserviceâ agreements. In total, Lilly-Vostok entered into over 96
such agreements with over 42 third-party entities between 1994 and 2004.

26. â_ Lilly- Vostok had little information about these third-party entities, beyond their
addresses and bank accounts. Rarely did Lilly-Vostok know who owned them or whether the
entities were actual businesses that could provide legitimate services. Senior management
employees in Lilly-Vostokâs Moscow branch assisted in the negotiation of these agreements.
The contracts themselves were derived from a Lilly-Vostok-created template and enumerated
various broadly-defined services, such as ensuring âimmediate customs clearanceâ or
âimmediate deliveryâ of the products; or assisting Lilly- Vostok in âobtaining payment for the

99 66

sales transaction,â âthe promotion of the products,â and âmarketing research.â

27. Contrary to what was recorded in the companyâs books and records, there is little
evidence that any services were actually provided under any of these third-party agreements.
Indeed, in many instances, the âservicesâ identified in the contract were already being provided
by the distributor, a third-party handler (such as an international shipping handler) or Lilly itself.
To the extent services such as expedited customs clearance or other services requiring interaction
with government officials were provided, Lilly-Vostok did not know or inquire how the third-
party intended to perform their services.

28. | Contemporaneous documents reflect that Lilly-Vostok employees viewed the

payments as necessary to obtain the business from the distributor or government entity, and not

10
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 11 of 20

as payment for legitimate services. For example, in November 1994, a senior manager at Lilly-
Vostok emailed the commercial manager, the employee tasked with drafting and approving the
language of the agreements, that the âstandard Marketing Agreement [is] where the [service
provider] delivers the service of getting this [purchase] contract for us ....â In August 1999, the
commercial manager emailed senior managers that âif real services are provided the marketing
agreement is not the appropriate form.â In other documents, Lilly-Vostok employees referred to
the payments as âdiscountsâ or âcommissionsâ to the distributor or government purchaser.

29. In 1997, Lilly conducted a business review of Lilly-Vostok to identify business
risks and assess the subsidiaryâs policies and procedures which resulted in a report. The report,
which was sent to Lilly-Vostok offices in Geneva and to Lilly headquarters in Indianapolis,
noted that â[b]usiness ethics [in Russia] are lowâ and that â[a] large base of opportunistic
entrepreneurs, lacking national presence build the distribution network.â The report concluded
that â[t]he nature and complexity of customers require that âconsultantsâ be used to âsupportâ
activities, leading to agreement signingâ (quotation marks in the original). The report pointed
out that the services provided by these consultants were broadly defined and duplicated activities
usually performed by Lilly-Vostokâs Russian staff, and that documentation of the services
received was not available. The report recommended that Lilly-Vostok modify its internal
controls to ensure that the services were documented and Lilly-Vostok was getting âvalue.â

30. In 1999, Lilly again reviewed Lilly-Vostokâs operations, including its use of
marketing agreements and concluded that they raised concerns. A second report, which was sent
to Geneva and Indianapolis headquarters and distributed to, among others, the individuals who at
that time were Lillyâs Chief Financial Officer, President of Lilly International Operations and

General Auditor, stated that:

11
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 12 of 20

Attention has been given to contain external unethical pressures through

guidelines and training. The use of marketing agreements with third-

parties has been tightened; agreements substance and permanent education

program continue to require effort and refinements.

31. Regarding the agreements, the second report concluded that the â{n]Jeed exists to
call on third-parties to create sales potential.â It recommended that Lilly-Vostok modify its
internal controls to assure itself that the agreements accurately and fairly reflect the services to
be provided.

32. Lilly did not curtail the use of marketing agreements by its subsidiary or make
any meaningful efforts to ensure that the marketing agreements were not being used as a method
to funnel money to government officials, despite recognition that the marketing agreements were
being used to âcreate sales potentialâ or âto âsupportâ activities leading to agreement-signingâ
with government entities. In fact, during the 2000-2004 period -- after the above-described
reports, but prior to the company ending use of the agreements -- Lilly-Vostok entered into the
three most expensive of these arrangements.

33. For example, in 2002, the Russian Ministry of Health announced that it would
engage in a âfederal tenderâ in which it would purchase drugs for the treatment of diabetes to be
provided free of charge to patients by the government. Under the terms of the tender, the
ministry selected a large Russian pharmaceutical distributor from which to purchase the
products, and this distributor, in turn, negotiated with Lilly-Vostok for the purchase of diabetes
products for resale to the Ministry of Health.

34. The large Russian pharmaceutical distributor was owned and controlled by a
wealthy and prominent Russian businessman. The Russian pharmaceutical distributor required

Lilly-Vostok, as a condition of their agreement, to enter into a âStorage and Delivery

Agreementâ with an entity incorporated in Cyprus. In July 2002, Lilly-Vostok executed the

12
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 13 of 20

purchase agreement with the distributor, which was signed on the distributorâs behalf by its
chairman, the prominent Russian businessman. At approximately the same time, Lilly-Vostok
also entered into the âStorage and Delivery Agreementâ with the entity in Cyprus.

35.  Lillyâs due diligence regarding the entity in Cyprus was limited to ordering a Dun
and Bradstreet report and conducting a search using an internet service to scan publicly available
information. Neither the Dun and Bradstreet report nor the internet search revealed the Cyprus
entityâs beneficial owner or anything about its business. Nonetheless, pursuant to the terms of its
arrangement with the distributor, Lilly-Vostok paid the entity in Cyprus over $3.8 million in
early 2003.

36. The Cyprus entity was, in fact, owned by the Russian businessman who was the
owner of the distributor. There is no evidence of services provided to Lilly-Vostok by the
Cyprus entity in consideration for Lilly- Vostokâs $3.8 million in payments. Lillyâs books and
records improperly reflected these payments as payments for services.

37. In at least two instances, the arrangements involved foreign government officials.
Between 2000 and 2005, Lilly-Vostok sold significant amounts of pharmaceutical products to a
major Russian pharmaceutical distributor for resale to the Russian Ministry of Health. The
pharmaceutical distributor was owned and controlled by an individual who, at the beginning of
the distributorâs relationship with Lilly-Vostok, was a close adviser to a member of Russiaâs
Parliament. In 2003, this official became a member of the upper house of Russiaâs Parliament.
Throughout the period, this official exercised considerable influence over government decisions
relating to the pharmaceutical industry in Russia.

38. As part of most of the sales arrangements with the distributor, the official

demanded that Lilly-Vostok enter into separate âmarketingâ agreements with entities with

13
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 14 of 20

addresses and bank accounts in Cyprus. Under the arrangement, Lilly-Vostok paid the Cypriot
entities up to thirty percent of the sales price of the underlying sales contracts in return for the
Cypriot entities entering into an agreement âto offer all assistance necessaryâ in various areas
like storage, importation and payment.

39. In conjunction with outside counsel, Lilly-Vostok conducted limited due diligence
on these third-parties. However, the due diligence did not identify the beneficial owners of these
third-parties or determine whether the third-parties were able to provide the contracted-for
assistance. Nonetheless, Lilly-Vostok concluded that it could proceed with the transactions and
paid the Cypriot entities over $5.2 million. In fact, the Cypriot entities were owned by an
individual associated with the distributor controlled by the member of the upper house of Russia
Parliament. The Cypriot entity transferred the payments from Lilly-Vostok to other off-shore
entities.

40. In connection with another series of contracts, from 2000 through 2004, Lilly-
Vostok sold products to a distributor, headquartered in Moscow, which was wholly-owned by a
Russian government entity. The purchase agreements were signed on the government-owned
distributorâs behalf by its General Director. As part of the arrangement, the government-owned
distributor selected a third-party entity with an address in the British Virgin Islands (âthe BVI
entityâ) with which Lilly-Vostok entered into agreements for the broadly defined
âservicesâ enumerated in the Lilly-Vostok template (see above). Under the terms of the
agreements between Lilly-Vostok and the BVI entity, Lilly-Vostok was to pay the BVI entity up
to 15% of the price of the product purchased by the government-owned distributor. Accordingly,
from 2000 through 2005, Lilly-Vostok made approximately 65 payments to the BVI entity

totaling approximately $2 million.

14
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 15 of 20

41. There is no evidence that the BVI entity performed any of the services listed in its
agreement with Lilly-Vostok. There is also no evidence that Lilly-Vostok performed any due
diligence or inquiry as to whether the BVI entity was able or did perform the contracted-for
services. Lastly, there is no evidence that Lilly-Vostok performed any due diligence or inquiry
into the identity of the beneficial owner of the BVI entity. In fact, the beneficial owner of the
BVI entity was the General Director of the government-owned distributor, and he ulimately
received the payments from the BVI entity.

42. Lilly did not direct Lilly-Vostok to cease entering into these third-party
agreements until 2004. However, Lilly permitted the subsidiary to continue making payments
under already existing third-party contracts as late as 2005.

43. From 2005 through 2008, Lilly-Vostok made various proposals to government
officials in Russia regarding how Lilly-Vostok could donate to or otherwise support various
initiatives that were affiliated with public or private institutions headed by the government
officials or otherwise important to the government officials. Examples included their personal
participation or the participation of people from their institutions in clinical trials and
international and regional conferences and the support of charities and educational events
associated with the institutes. At times, these proposals to government officials were made in a
communication that also included a request for assistance in getting a product reimbursed or
purchased by the government. Generally, Lilly-Vostok personnel believed these proposals were
proper because of their relevance to public health issues and many of the proposals were
reviewed by counsel. Nonetheless, Lilly-Vostok did not have in place internal controls through

which such proposals were vetted to ascertain whether Lilly-Vostok was offering something of

15
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 16 of 20

value to a government official for a purpose of influencing or inducing him or her to assist Lilly-
Vostok in obtaining or retaining business.
Lillyâs Books and Records

44. __ As detailed above, subsidiaries of Eli Lilly made numerous payments that were
incorrectly described in the companyâs books and records. In China, payments were falsely
described as reimbursement of expenses when, in fact, the money was used to provide gifts to
government-employed physicians. In Brazil, money that was described in company records as a
âdiscountâ for a pharmaceutical distributor was, in actuality, a bribe for government officials. In
Poland, payments classified as charitable donations were not intended for a genuine charitable
purpose but rather to induce a government official to assent to the purchase of a Lilly product.
Finally, in Russia, millions of dollars in payments, described in the companyâs books and records
as for various services, were actually payments to assure that Lilly was able to conduct business
with certain pharmaceutical distributors.

Lillyâs Internal Controls

45. During the relevant period, Lilly and its subsidiaries failed to devise and maintain
an adequate system of internal accounting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the
company maintained accountability for its assets and transactions were executed in accordance
with managementâs authorization. Particularly, Lilly did not adequately verify that
intermediaries with which the company was doing government-related business would not
provide a benefit to a government official on Lillyâs behalf in order to obtain or retain business.
Lilly and its subsidiaries primarily relied on assurances and information provided in the
paperwork by these intermediaries or by Lilly personnel rather than engaging in adequate

verification and analyzing the surrounding circumstances of the transaction. Lilly and its

16
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 17 of 20

subsidiariesâ employees considered and offered benefits to government officials at the same time
they were asking those government officials to assist with the reimbursement or purchase of
Lillyâs products with inadequate safeguards to assure that its employees were not offering items
of values to a government official with a purpose to assist Lilly in retaining or obtaining
business.

46. Moreover, despite an understanding that certain emerging markets were most
vulnerable to FCPA violations, Lillyâs audit department, based out of Indianapolis, had no
procedures specifically designed to assess the FCPA or bribery risks of sales and purchases.
Accordingly, transactions with off-shore entities or with government-affiliated entities did not
receive specialized or closer review for possible FCPA violations. In assessing these
transactions, the auditors relied upon the standard accounting controls which primarily assured
the soundness of the paperwork. There was little done to assess whether, despite the existence of
facially acceptable paperwork, the surrounding circumstances or terms of a transaction suggested
the possibility of an FCPA violation or bribery.

Lillyâs Remedial Efforts

47. Since the time of the conduct noted in this Complaint, Lilly has made
improvements to its global anti-corruption compliance program, including: enhancing anti-
corruption due diligence requirements for relationships with third parties; implementing
compliance monitoring and corporate auditing specifically tailored to anti-corruption; enhancing
financial controls and governance; and expanding anti-corruption training throughout the

organization.

Claim One
Violations of Section 30A of the Exchange Act

48. Paragraphs 4-6, 25-32 and 37-42 are hereby realleged and incorporated by
reference.

49. Section 30A of the Exchange Act prohibits public companies, through their

authorizing illicit payments to a person while knowing that all or a portion of those payments
would be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official or official of a
foreign political party for the purposes of influencing his acts or decisions in his official capacity,
inducing him to do or omit to do actions in violation of his lawful duties, securing an improper
advantage, or inducing such foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government or
instrumentality thereof to assist in obtaining or retaining business. When knowledge of the
existence of a particular circumstance is required for an offense, such knowledge is established if
a person is aware of a high probability of the existence of such circumstance, unless the person
actually believes that such circumstance does not exist.

50. As detailed above, Lilly violated Exchange Act 30A.

Claim Two
Violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act

51. Paragraphs 1 through 50 are hereby realleged and incorporated by reference.

comply with Section 13(b)(2)(A).

18
Case 1:12-cv-02045 Document1 Filed 12/20/12 Page 19 of 20

54. As detailed above, Lilly, through its foreign subsidiaries, made numerous entries
in its books and records that did not accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the issuer. In connection with these payments, Lilly failed to make and keep
accurate books, records, and accounts as required by Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A).

Claim Three
Violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act

55. Paragraphs 1 through 54 are hereby realleged and incorporated by reference

56. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires public companies to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances

authorization; and (11) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets.

57. Public companies are responsible for ensuring that their foreign subsidiaries
comply with Section 13(b)(2)(B).

58. As detailed above, Lilly failed to devise and maintain an effective system of

SEC Charges Eli Lilly and Company with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-273

Washington, D.C., Dec. 20, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Eli Lilly and Company with violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for improper payments its subsidiaries made to foreign government officials to win millions of dollars of
business in Russia, Brazil, China, and Poland.

The SEC alleges that the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical companyâs subsidiary in Russia used offshore âmarketing agreementsâ to pay
millions of dollars to third parties chosen by government customers or distributors, despite knowing little or nothing about the third parties
beyond their offshore address and bank account information. These offshore entities rarely provided any services and in some instances were
used to funnel money to government officials in order to obtain business for the subsidiary. Transactions with offshore or government-
affiliated entities did not receive specialized or closer review for possible FCPA violations. Paperwork was accepted at face value and little was
done to assess whether the terms or circumstances surrounding a transaction suggested the possibility of foreign bribery.

The SEC alleges that when the company did become aware of possible FCPA violations in Russia, Lilly did not curtail the subsidiaryâs use of
the marketing agreements for more than five years. Lilly subsidiaries in Brazil, China, and Poland also made improper payments to
government officials or third-party entities associated with government officials. Lilly agreed to pay more than $29 million to settle the SECâs
charges.

âWhen a parent company learns tell-tale signs of a bribery scheme involving a subsidiary, it must take immediate action to assure that the
FCPA is not being violated,â said Antonia Chion, Associate Director in the SEC Enforcement Division. âWe strongly caution company officials
from averting their eyes from what they do not wish to see.â

Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs Foreign Corrupt Practices Unit, added, âEli Lilly and its subsidiaries
possessed a âcheck the boxâ mentality when it came to third-party due diligence. Companies canât simply rely on paper-thin assurances by
employees, distributors, or customers. They need to look at the surrounding circumstances of any payment to adequately assess whether it
could wind up in a government officialâs pocket.â

As alleged in the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C.:

e Lillyâs subsidiary in Russia paid millions of dollars to offshore entities for alleged âmarketing servicesâ in order to induce pharmaceutical
distributors and government entities to purchase Lillyâs drugs, including approximately $2 million to an offshore entity owned by a
government official and approximately $5.2 million to offshore entities owned by a person closely associated with an important
member of Russiaâs parliament. Despite the companyâs recognition that the marketing agreements were being used to âcreate sales
potentialâ with government customers and that it did not appear that any actual services were being rendered under the agreements,
Eli Lilly allowed its subsidiary to continue using the agreements for years.

e Employees at Lillyâs subsidiary in China falsified expense reports in order to provide spa treatments, jewelry, and other improper gifts
and cash payments to government-employed physicians.

e Lillyâs subsidiary in Brazil allowed one of its pharmaceutical distributors to pay bribes to government health officials to facilitate $1.2
million in sales of a Lilly drug product to state government institutions.

e Lillyâs subsidiary in Poland made eight improper payments totaling $39,000 to a small charitable foundation that was founded and
administered by the head of one of the regional government health authorities in exchange for the officialâs support for placing Lilly
drugs on the government reimbursement list.

Lilly agreed to pay disgorgement of $13,955,196, prejudgment interest of $6,743,538, and a penalty of $8.7 million for a total payment of
$29,398,734. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lilly consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the
company from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. Lilly also agreed to comply with
certain undertakings including the retention of an independent consultant to review and make recommendations about its foreign corruption
policies and procedures. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Steven A. Susswein. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs
Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

MARK A. JACKSON )
and JAMES J. RUEHLEN, )
)
Defendant. )
)

 

Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ), alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the
âFCPAââ) by Mark A. Jackson (ââJacksonââ) and James J. Ruehlen (ââRuehlenââ) (collectively
Defendantsâ), who are a former and a current employee of Noble Corporation (âNobleâ), an
international provider of offshore drilling services and equipment to oil companies throughout
the world, including Nigeria.

2. Noble and its wholly owned subsidiary, Noble Drilling (Nigeria) Ltd. (âNoble-
Nigeriaâ), authorized its customs agent to pay bribes on Nobleâs and Noble-Nigeriaâs behalf to
Nigerian government officials to influence or induce them to (1) favorably process false
paperwork, (2) grant temporary import permits (âTIPsâ) based on the false paperwork, and (3)
favorably exercise or abuse their discretion in granting extensions to these illicit TIPs.
Defendants approved payment of the bribes. Defendant Ruehlen also assisted the customs agent

in preparing false documents, processed the customs agentâs invoices for the bribes, and signed
the checks reimbursing the customs agent for the bribes he paid to Nigerian government
officials. Defendants acted in this way to obtain TIPs and TIP extensions and retain business
under drilling contracts in Nigeria. As a consequence, Defendants violated the anti-bribery
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§78dd-1].

3. Defendants also took steps to circumvent Nobleâs internal controls and to falsely
record these bribes as legitimate operating expenses on Nobleâs books. Defendant Jackson failed
to implement internal accounting controls to prevent the bribery and false recording of the
bribes. As a consequence, Defendants violated the records falsification and internal control
provisions of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§78m(b)(5) and 17 C.F.R. Â§240.13b2-1], and aided
and abetted Nobleâs violation of the books and records and internal control provisions of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§$78m(b)(2)(A) and (B)].

4. Defendant Jackson misled Nobleâs auditors about the bribes and signed
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 falsely stating that he had created and
maintained effective internal controls, and that there were no internal control weaknesses, fraud,
or FCPA violations. As a consequence, Jackson violated Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14 of the
Exchange Act [17 C.F.R. Â§Â§240.13b2-2 and 240.13a-14].

5. During the violations, Jackson was Nobleâs Chief Financial Officer (âCFOâ),
Chief Operating Officer (âCOOâ), and ultimately President, Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ),
and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Jackson directly or indirectly controlled Noble,
Defendant Ruehlen, and others, and therefore is liable as a control person under Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§78t(a)] for all of their violations.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has jurisdiction under Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. Noble, Jackson, and Ruehlen, directly or indirectly,
made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including electronic mail, of
the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the transactions,
acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

7. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d) because, among other reasons, certain acts or transactions
constituting the violations by Defendants occurred in this district.

DEFENDANTS AND OTHER ENTITIES

8. Jackson was Nobleâs CFO from September 2000 to about October 2005, and
Acting CFO from about March 2006 to about November 2006. Jackson became COO in March
2005, became the President and COO in February 2006, became a Director in July 2006, and
became CEO in late October 2006. When Jackson resigned in September 2007, he was
President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board.

9. As CFO and Acting CFO, Jackson was responsible for Nobleâs compliance with
the FCPA. He received regular reports of payments made to government officials, and he
reviewed and approved such payments, including those for TIPs and TIP extensions. As CFO
and Acting CFO, Jackson supervised Nobleâs internal audit, finance, and accounting functions.
He was responsible for the accuracy of Nobleâs books, including the accurate recording of
payments to government officials.

10. From about May 2005 through early 2007, Jackson directly supervised Ruehlen,
oversaw Noble-Nigeriaâs operations, and regularly communicated with Ruehlen about the status

of drilling rigs in Nigeria and other issues facing Noble-Nigeria.
11. As CEO, Jackson also oversaw FCPA compliance and the accuracy of Nobleâs
financial statements.

12. On September 20, 2007, Jackson resigned from Noble. Jackson later became
President of Mark Jackson Investments, LLC. From about August 2011 to about February 2012,
Jackson was the Managing Director and CEO of another public company in the oil industry.
Jackson markets himself as an independent oil and energy professional interested in new
ventures, consulting offers, business deals and career opportunities. Before joining Noble,
Jackson served as CFO of another company in the oil industry.

13. Ruehlen is the highest Noble executive in Nigeria and today remains responsible
for all of Noble-Nigeriaâs operations. Ruehlenâs permanent residence is in Houston, Texas.

14. On or about September 15, 2004, Ruehlen became the Division Manager of
Noble-Nigeria and a member of its Board of Directors. He reported to Nobleâs Vice President of
Eastern Hemisphere Operations from about September 2004 to about May 2005 and directly to
Jackson from about May 2005 to about the first quarter of 2007. Throughout the relevant time,
Ruehlen signed Division representation letters certifying his divisionâs compliance with Nobleâs
policies, the FCPA, and other governmental laws, certifying the accuracy of Nobleâs books,
records and accounts, and certifying its adherence to internal controls, among other things.

15. In the two years before becoming the Division Manager, Ruehlen worked in
Nobleâs operations and corporate internal audit groups. He worked on an audit of the West
Africa Division during which he learned of the unlawful use of false paperwork and unreceipted
payments to Nigerian government officials to obtain TIPs and TIP extensions.

16. During the relevant period, Noble Corporation (âNobleââ?) was a Cayman Islands

corporation whose common stock was registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and
traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol âNEâ. Nobleâs headquarters and
principal executive offices were in Sugar Land, Texas. In March 2009, Noble incorporated in
Switzerland, and its corporate and principal executive offices moved overseas. Noble retained
the Sugar Land office as its main U.S. office for the Noble group of companies operating in the
U.S., and its common stock continues to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. âNobleâ herein refers to the current Swiss parent
company or to the former Cayman Islands parent. Noble, through its subsidiaries, performs
contract oil drilling services with a fleet of mobile offshore drilling units located worldwide.

17. Noble Drilling (Nigeria) Ltd., ââNoble-Nigeriaââ or âWest Africa Divisionâ) is a
wholly-owned Noble subsidiary, incorporated in Nigeria in September 1990 as an oil industry

service company. Its financial results are consolidated into the financial statements of Noble.

 

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
I. The Temporary Import Regime in Nigeria and False Paperwork
18. Noble earns revenue by contracting with oil and gas companies to drill oil and gas

wells offshore in locations around the world, including Nigeria. Nobleâs operations in Nigeria
are conducted by Noble-Nigeria. Between January 2003 and May 2007, Noble-Nigeria had up to
seven drilling rigs that operated offshore in Nigeria. Nigeria allowed these rigs to operate in its
waters without the payment of permanent import duties associated with the rig on the basis of
temporary import permits (ââTIPsââ) obtained from the Nigeria Customs Service (âNCSâ).

19. NCS is the Nigerian government agency that controls the issuance of TIPs and
TIP extensions. Under Nigerian law, NCS grants TIPs for rigs that, subject to any other

conditions imposed by NCS, will be in the country only temporarily. TIP grants state that they
are valid for one year and are conditioned on, among other things, the procurement of a bank
bond for the full value of permanent import duties.

20. Upon proper application, NCS may, in its discretion, grant up to three six-month
extensions to a TIP for a rig. At the expiration of a TIP and any TIP extensions, NCS required
that the rig be exported from Nigeria. If a rig was needed in Nigeria to complete work on a
drilling contract past the expiration of a TIP and any extensions, NCS required that the rig be
exported and that the rig owner seek a new TIP in order to re-import the rig. Alternatively, the
rig owner could apply to convert the rig to permanent import status. Converting the rig to
permanent import status would include, among other things, paying the appropriate, and often
costly, duties associated with permanent import status. Failure to export and re-import the rig
pursuant to a new TIP, or to convert it to permanent import status, would subject the rig owner to
sanctions, including seizure of the rig by the government and forfeiture of the ownerâs bond.

21. NCS did not deal directly with rig owners. It required that companies submit
applications and correspondence as to TIPs and extensions through licensed customs agents.

22. Contrary to Nigerian law, Noble-Nigeria did not export its rigs at the expiration of
TIPs and extensions. Nor did it seek to convert its rigs to permanent import status and pay
permanent import duties. Instead, Ruehlen and other Noble-Nigeria officials, and its customs
agent, with Jacksonâs knowledge and approval, created false documents showing that the rigs
moved out of and back into Nigerian waters, when the rigs in fact never moved. Ruehlen and
Noble-Nigeria, through the customs agent, and based at times on Jacksonâs authorization, paid
bribes to Nigerian officials to secure stamps and other illegitimate processing of documents that

made it falsely appear as if the rigs were exported and re-imported as required by Nigerian law.
II. Noble Paid Bribes to Obtain TIPs and Extensions

23. To obtain TIPs with false paperwork, Ruehlen sought authorization for, and
Jackson authorized, illicit payments to Nigerian government officials. Typically, the process,
from about September 2004 to about May 2007, was that Ruehlen would obtain a price proposal
from the customs agent detailing the costs associated with obtaining a new TIP or TIP extension.
These proposals would clearly state which charges would not have any supporting backup
documentation, such as those labeled as âspecial handlingâ or âprocurement.â

24. The terms âspecial handlingâ and âprocurementâ denoted unreceipted payments,
or bribes, to government officials. Ruehlen understood that all payments specifically labeled
âspecial handlingâ or âprocurementâ without supporting documentation were payments to
government officials. From about September 2004 to about May 2007, Ruehlen generally
referred to all unreceipted TIP-related payments to government officials as âspecial handling,â
regardless of the label used by the agent. Because Nobleâs FCPA policy required all such
payments to be pre-approved in writing by the CFO, Ruehlen usually sent an e-mail from his
post in Nigeria to the CFO in Sugar Land, Texas, who at times during the relevant period was
Jackson, requesting approval for the âspecial handlingâ charges. Throughout the relevant period,
Jackson understood that all requests from Ruehlen to pay âspecial handlingâ charges for TIPs
and TIP extensions were requests to make unreceipted payments to government officials to
secure false paperwork TIPs or discretionary TIP extensions.

25. Once he received approval, Ruehlen would authorize the agent to proceed with
the payments to government officials to ensure the favorable processing and grant of TIPs or TIP
extensions. However, Ruehlen sometimes authorized the agent to pay Nigerian government

officials without first obtaining approval from the CFO, in violation of Noble policy.
26. After the customs agent completed the work and paid the bribes as directed, the
agent sent Ruehlen and Noble-Nigeria its invoice. Ruehlen then would process and approve the
invoice for payment, thereby reimbursing the customs agent for the bribes it had paid
government officials, in order to obtain TIPs and TIP extensions, and assist Noble to continue
doing business under contracts. Ruehlen would also, at times, sign the check that reimbursed the
customs agent for the bribes paid to government officials at his, Nobleâs, and Noble-Nigeriaâs
request.

27. From about January 2003 through about May 2007, Noble and Noble-Nigeria
employees, including at times Ruehlen and Jackson, authorized the agent to pay bribes and
reimbursed the agent for the bribes paid to Nigerian government officials on their behalf to
process eleven illegitimate TIPs with false paperwork. The NCS actually issued to Noble-
Nigeria eight of those eleven illegitimate TIPs.

28. To obtain the eight false paperwork TIPs, Noble and Noble-Nigeria employees,
including at times Ruehlen and Jackson, paid the customs agent at least $79,026, which the agent
specifically labeled on its invoice as âspecial handlingâ charges. Jackson and Ruehlen knew that
the âspecial handlingâ charges were payments that the customs agent made to government
officials, at their, Nobleâs, and Noble-Nigeriaâs request, to induce Nigerian officials to process
and grant the illicit false paperwork TIPs.

29. Noble and Noble-Nigeria employees, including at times Ruehlen and Jackson,
made additional payments of $180,326, which Defendants understood to be unreceipted
payments to Nigerian government officials, or bribes, but which the customs agent invoiced as

âprocurement of new TIP.â Jackson and Ruehlen knew that the âprocurementâ charges were
payments that the customs agent made to government officials, at their, Nobleâs, and Noble-
Nigeriaâs request, to induce the officials to process and grant the illicit false paperwork TIPs.

30. With respect to the three remaining false paperwork TIPs that Noble-Nigeria
sought, Noble and Noble-Nigeria officials, including Ruehlen, based on Jacksonâs previous
approvals and other actions, authorized the customs agent to pay bribes to Nigerian officials to
secure these three false paperwork TIPs in 2007. The customs agent then obtained, through
bribes paid at Ruehlenâs, Nobleâs, and Noble-Nigeriaâs request to Nigerian officials, false bond
cancellations and other false documents purporting to show the export of the three rigs. The
customs agent then invoiced Noble-Nigeria for reimbursement of the âspecial handlingâ charges,
or bribes totaling about $50,000. Because Nobleâs Audit Committee, in or about May 2007, had
begun an internal investigation into payments to government officials in Nigeria for TIPs and
TIP extensions, the invoices ultimately were not paid.

31. In addition to obtaining TIPs with false paperwork, Noble and Noble-Nigeria
employees, including at times Ruehlen and Jackson, paid bribes, through the customs agent, to
Nigerian government officials to obtain discretionary or unlawful extensions of these TIPs.
From January 2003 through May 2007, Noble-Nigeria obtained about twenty-nine TIP
extensions: about fourteen first extensions; about ten second extensions; about four third
extensions; and one fourth extension. The bribes Noble authorized and Noble-Nigeria paid,
through the customs agent, after July 2004 for first and second TIP extensions totaled about
$231,098. The bribes for the third extensions totaled about $137,942. The bribe for the fourth
extension totaled about $54,688.

32. Through their illicit payments to Nigerian government officials, Noble and Noble-

Nigeria retained business under lucrative drilling contracts, obtained profits from operating rigs
in Nigeria, and avoided paying permanent import duties on its rigs. Noble also avoided the
operational costs of moving its rigs, and avoided possible breaches of drilling contracts.

Ill. Defendants Jackson and Ruehlen Knew Noble-Nigeria Paid Bribes to Obtain
Unlawful False Paperwork TIPs and TIP Extensions

33. In 2003 and 2004, several events occurred that caused Defendants Jackson and
Ruehlen to learn, if they did not already know, that Noble-Nigeria paid bribes to Nigerian
government officials through its customs agent to obtain extensions and false paperwork TIPs.

A. In 2003, Nigeria Penalized Noble-Nigeria for TIP Violations, Including the
Use of False Paperwork

34. In or about February 2003, Jackson and others learned that the Nigerian
government had assembled a panel to investigate abuses of the TIP regime. The panel came to
be known as the âPanel of Inquiry.â

35. In or about February 2003, Jackson and others also learned that the Panel of
Inquiry had found evidence that Noble-Nigeria violated the law by, among other things,
preparing false documents showing export and re-import of rigs to obtain new TIPs when the
rigs did not actually move.

36. On or about February 24 and 25, 2003, NCS and the Panel of Inquiry demanded
Noble-Nigeria pay a penalty of 31,000,000 Naira for its violations. Jackson and others knew of
the assessed penalty and that it related, in part, to the use of false paperwork to obtain TIPs.
Jackson also knew that Noble-Nigeria paid the penalty.

B. In 2004, an Internal FCPA Audit and Review of Payments to Government

Officials Revealed Poor Internal Controls and Large Payments for TIPs and
TIP Extensions

37. In or about January 2004, Nobleâs internal audit group conducted a company-

wide audit of compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPA Auditâ). The final

10
FCPA Audit Report was dated January 15, 2004. Jackson received it and understood its
findings.

38. The FCPA Audit found, among other things, that employees did not understand
the FCPA, did not comply with Nobleâs FCPA policies and procedures, did not get proper
approvals before making unreceipted payments to foreign government officials, and did not
properly record such payments in Noble-Nigeriaâs accounts.

39. As a result of these findings, Noble-Nigeria reviewed its account relating to
unreceipted government payments. The review revealed that in 2003 Noble-Nigeria made
payments to Nigerian government officials totaling about $666,983, of which all were
improperly recorded. Jackson knew the results of the review. Jackson also knew that of the
improperly-recorded payments, TIP-related payments accounted for only 4% of the number of
payments, but about 82% of the total dollars. Jackson and others understood that the TIP-related
payments went to Nigerian government officials.

AO. Jackson and others knew that the unreceipted TIP payments to government
officials created a risk of FCPA violations. As a result, Noble and Noble-Nigeria subsequently
required its customs agent to clearly delineate on its invoices all unreceipted payments to
government officials, and required Noble-Nigeria to seek and obtain Nobleâs CFOâs review and
approval before authorizing the agent to make any such payments.

41. Jackson and others understood that âspecial handlingâ charges were unreceipted
payments to Nigerian government officials that required CFO review and approval in writing.

42. Nobleâs FCPA policy generally defined âfacilitating paymentâ as âa small
payment to assure or speed the proper performance of a foreign officialâs duties that does not

involve a discretionary action by such official.â By its terms, the definition excludes large

11
payments, all payments connected with discretionary acts, and all payments to induce foreign
officials to process and approve false documents.

C, In 2004, an Internal Audit of the West Africa Division Revealed the Use of
False Paperwork to Obtain an Additional TIP

43. Shortly after the FCPA Audit and while the review of unreceipted payments to
government officials was underway, Nobleâs internal audit group audited Noble-Nigeriaâs
operations and performed a follow-up check on its FCPA compliance (â2004 West Africa
Division Auditâ). Ruehlen was on the audit team. He conducted field work in Nigeria and
helped to draft the audit report.

44, On or about February 13, 2004, Ruehlen learned that the West Africa Division in
2003 made a large number of payments to government officials that were not properly reported,
most of which related to TIPs. Ruehlen also learned that payments to obtain new TIPs were
large, averaging approximately $75,000 every two years.

45. In or about February or March 2004, Ruehlen learned that Noble-Nigeria used a
customs agent to secure TIPs. He also learned that a TIP was valid for twelve months, and was
told that Noble-Nigeria could receive up to two six-month extensions. Ruehlen learned that rigs
have to be physically exported after two years. Ruehlen also learned that Noble-Nigeria did not
physically export its rigs, but instead obtained new TIPs using false paperwork accompanied by
payments to government officials.

46. In or about January and February 2004, Noble-Nigeria obtained two new TIPs
using false paperwork. Noble-Nigeria gave its customs agent 9,975,000 Naira per rig to obtain
the illegal TIPs, and received no documentation or support for the payments. Noble-Nigeria
employees understood that a portion of the payments went to Nigerian officials to ensure that the

false paperwork was processed and the illegal TIPs granted.

12
47. On or about March 22, 2004, Ruehlen summarized in writing the audit results.
Ruehlen described the lawful TIP process in Nigeria, as well as Noble-Nigeriaâs practice of
using false paperwork and paying about $75,000 every two years to the customs agent for false
paperwork TIPs. Ruehlen described the penalty Noble-Nigeria paid to NCS in 2003 for
improper TIP paperwork. He stated that Noble-Nigeria was using false pretenses to obtain TIPs
and was at risk of additional fines for the improper use of the temporary import permit system.

A8. However, the final 2004 West Africa Division Audit Report, which was
completed by Ruehlen and others on or about April 12, 2004, falsely implied that the use of false
paperwork was not a recurring practice by Noble, but rather was a one-time occurrence. The
report omitted mention of any payments to government officials, omitted to state that Noble-
Nigeriaâs unreceipted TIP-related payments comprised about 82% of the Divisionâs total
government payments in dollars in 2003, but only 4% of the total number of payments, and
omitted the fact that Noble-Nigeria had been penalized by the Nigerian government for the use
of false paperwork in connection with TIPs. Jackson and Ruehlen knew these facts, and they
knew that the 2004 West Africa Division Audit Report omitted them.

49. By no later than April 2004, Jackson and Ruehlen knew that obtaining TIPs
through false paperwork and unreceipted payments to foreign officials was wrong, unlawful, and
a violation of Nobleâs policy to comply with all laws and regulations.

50. The Audit Committee of Nobleâs Board of Directors and Nobleâs independent
auditors received a copy of the final 2004 West Africa Division Audit Report. The report
highlighted the finding about a false paperwork TIP as a significant area for control and process

improvements.

13
51. On April 20, 2004, the Audit Committee of Nobleâs Board of Directors met and
considered the 2004 West Africa Division Audit Report. The Audit Committee made clear that
it was concerned about the use of false paperwork and expected no recurrence. Jackson was
present at the meeting.

52. Jackson and Ruehlen understood that the Audit Committee and the independent
auditors incorrectly believed that Noble-Nigeria had used false paperwork to obtain TIPs only
once, and that the Committee and auditors had not been told that Noble-Nigeria paid bribes,
through its customs agent, to obtain illicit false paperwork TIPs.

53. Jackson and Ruehlen knew that using false paperwork to obtain TIPs would
contravene the expectations and the instructions of the Audit Committee. At an Audit
Committee meeting on or about July 22, 2004, the head of internal audit informed the committee
that the TIP issue was resolved because the West Africa Division would no longer use false
paperwork, but would physically export and re-import the rigs as necessary and required by
Nigerian law. Jackson attended the meeting, was aware of the resolution, and knew that false
paperwork would no longer be used to obtain TIPs.

D. Noble-Nigeria Paid NCS Officials to Grant Discretionary Third Extensions
and Sought Alternatives to Exporting and Re-Importing Rigs

54. In or about late July 2004, Noble-Nigeria began to explore the possibility of
obtaining third extensions for two rigs. NCS could grant third extensions at its discretion.
Ruehlen began working in Nigeria during the summer of 2004 and participated in seeking the
third extensions.

55. On or about July 29, 2004, Ruehlen received the customs agentâs proposals for
obtaining third extensions for two rigs. The proposals stated that third extensions would require

5,000,000 Naira each in âspecial handlingâ charges and 350,000 Naira in customs agent fees.

14
56. Ruehlen knew that a second extension required a âspecial handlingâ charge of
only 1,600,000 Naira and thought that the 5,000,000 Naira âspecial handlingâ charge for a third
extension was excessive. Despite his concern, Ruehlen instructed the agent to get the third
extensions for the two rigs.

57. On or about August 9, 2004, Noble-Nigeria and Ruehlen received the customs
agentâs invoices for the third extensions. The high cost of the extensions caused Ruehlen to
check with another customs agent and to investigate converting the rigs to permanent import
status. On or about August 17, 2004, Ruehlen reported to the Vice President of Eastern
Hemisphere Operations that another customs agent confirmed that additional extensions would
require âexorbitant amountsâ and that exporting and re-importing rigs for new TIPs would entail
at least 30 days off production and other difficulties. Ruehlen stated that he was investigating
converting the rigs to permanent import status and that the import duties associated with
conversion could be less than the âexorbitantâ and escalating costs of additional extensions.

58. In or about August 2004, Noble-Nigeriaâs Operations Manager told Ruehlen that
he did not have a good feeling about the customs agent, who was requiring payment of 5,000,000
Naira in âspecial handlingâ for the third extensions, and recommended no further involvement
with the agent. The Operations Manager told Ruehlen that âthe way the[y] work is not sound
and above the table.â

59. Despite concerns over the exorbitant payments to government officials and the
integrity of the customs agent, Noble-Nigeria sought Jacksonâs approval to pay the invoice for
the two third extensions. The request for approval dated August 30, 2004 made clear that the
5,000,000 Naira was an unreceipted payment to government officials and was a high but

necessary cost to obtain the extensions.

15
60. Jackson approved payment of the âspecial handlingâ charges on or about August
31, 2004.

61. In or about September 2004, Noble-Nigeria paid the 5,000,000 Naira per rig
âspecial handlingâ charges and booked them as legitimate operating costs, which they were not.
62. On or about September 8, 2004, Ruehlen received copies of the two third
extensions. The extensions specifically stated that NCS would grant no more extensions and that

the rigs must be exported on or before February 22 or 28, 2005, or be subject to forfeiture.

63. As of September 8, 2004, Ruehlen knew that NCS required the two rigs to be
exported at the conclusion of the extensions or be converted to permanent import status.

64. From August 2004 to about early February 2005, Ruehlen continued to
investigate alternative ways to get import permits for rigs. On September 17, 2004, Ruehlen
received a written legal opinion on the implications of converting the rigs to permanent import
status. The legal opinion stated that items imported on a temporary basis must be exported at the
end of the import period or be subject to fines and forfeiture. It also stated that the Nigerian
Government was concerned about abuses of the temporary import process, noted the earlier
Panel of Inquiry, and advised Noble-Nigeria to comply with all temporary import requirements
before considering conversion to permanent import status.

65. In December 2004, Ruehlen had Noble-Nigeria ask its customs agent about
getting fourth extensions for two rigs, as well as getting a third extension for another rig.

66. Ruehlen received the customs agentâs response in January 2005. The customs
agent told Ruehlen that the third extension would again cost 5,000,000 Naira in âspecial

handlingâ charges and 350,000 Naira in customs agent fees. The customs agent told Ruehlen

16
that authorities at NCS stated that no fourth extensions would be granted. The customs agent
recommended exporting and re-importing the rigs to obtain new TIPs.

67. In February 2005, Ruehlen learned that NCS would not grant a discretionary third
extension because that rig was operating under a different drilling contract than the contract used
to get its original TIP, in violation of the TIPâs terms.

IV. Defendants Jackson and Ruehlen Resumed the Use of False Paperwork and
Authorized and Paid Bribes to Obtain New TIPs with False Paperwork

68. To retain business under drilling contracts and avoid the loss of profits and other
costs associated with moving rigs in and out of Nigeria, Ruehlen decided in February 2005 to
resume the use of false paperwork to obtain new TIPs for three rigs and to pay Nigerian
government officials through the customs agent to process the false paperwork and grant the
TIPs. Ruehlen did so knowing that obtaining TIPs through false paperwork and making related
payments to government officials was prohibited, unlawful, and against Noble policy. Ruehlen
did not seek approval from legal counsel or the Audit Committee before resuming the use of
false paperwork or before making the related illicit payments. He did not inform legal counsel or
the Audit Committee about the resumption and payments before May 2007.

69. On or about February 7, 2005, Ruehlen requested a price proposal to obtain the
three new false paperwork TIPs. The customs agent told Ruehlen that âprocurementâ of each
TIP would cost 5,000,000 Naira and that there would be âspecial handlingâ charges of 1,900,000
Naira for each rig associated with showing the outward and inward âmovementâ of each rig.

The agentâs price proposal also showed that it would make payments to the Nigerian Port
Authority (ââNPAââ) and National Maritime Authority (âNMAâ) and pay husbandry charges at
Cameroon offshore. Because the rigs would not move or leave Nigerian waters, Ruehlen and

others understood that the NPA, NMA and Cameroon offshore charges and receipts would be

17
secured through payment of the âspecial handling charges,â or bribes. Ruehlen also understood
that the 5,000,000 Naira âprocurementâ charge to procure the TIP for each rig was the equivalent
of âspecial handlingâ payments to government officials.

70. Between February 21 and 28, 2005, Ruehlen authorized the customs agent to use
false paperwork and make all the payments to government officials outlined in the price proposal
to obtain the TIPs. Between February 21 and 28, 2005, Ruehlen prepared and signed the TIP
applications for the three rigs and arranged to have the customs agent pick up the application
materials for submission to NCS. These TIP applications falsely represented that the rigs were
outside of Nigeria awaiting import when they were not.

71. On or about February 25, 2005, Ruehlen e-mailed the Vice President of Eastern
Hemisphere Operations that he had decided to resume the use of false paperwork and related
payments to government officials to obtain TIPs. Ruehlen said that NCS had denied Noble any
further extensions for the three rigs and asked Noble-Nigeria to export and re-import the rigs to
obtain new TIPs. Ruehlen said that the customs agent told NCS that the rigs could not be moved
because they were still under contract, but that NCS nevertheless denied the requested fourth
extensions for two of the rigs. In addition, Ruehlen said that the other rig could not get a third
extension because it was operating under a different contract from the one used to obtain its
original TIP. Ruehlen said that â[t]he sum of all this is that we reexport [sic] the three rigs from
Nigeria to Cameroon. The rigs would than [sic] be rei1mported [sic] into Nigeria on new
Temporary Import Bonds. The rigs would be shown on paper as leaving Nigeria and than [sic]
reimported [sic] 20 to 30 days later.â Ruehlen gave the Vice President the customs agentâs price

proposal and highlighted that paying âspecial handlingâ charges would be necessary. Ruehlen

18
also said that he had received confirmation from other contractors in Nigeria that fourth TIP
extensions are not allowed.

72. Ruehlen received no written response from the Vice President of Eastern
Hemisphere Operations.

73. The customs agent began the false paperwork for the three rigs in late February
2005. The customs agent asked NCS to cancel each rigâs bond. NCS granted those requests by
notice dated March 1, 2005. The âCancellation of Bondâ notice stated that the cancellation was
based on âevidenceâ that the rigs had been exported through the Calabar Port. Because the rigs
did not move and were not exported, the documents presented to NCS were false and were
processed illicitly through the payment of bribes. Ruehlen and Noble-Nigeria authorized the
payment of the bribes when they authorized the payment of âspecial handlingâ charges. Ruehlen
knew that such charges would be undocumented payments to government officials in connection
with false paperwork. Ruehlen also knew that NCS would not have granted the bond
cancellations or processed the false evidence of rig export without payment of these bribes.

74. By late March 2005, Ruehlen and Noble-Nigeria had for each of the three rigs: (1)
authorized the customs agent to secure a TIP with false paperwork and payments to government
officials; (2) prepared and submitted the TIP application that falsely represented that the rig was
outside of Nigeria awaiting import when it was not; (3) completed the export portion of the false
paperwork; and (4) obtained the bond cancellation.

75. On or about March 30, 2005, Ruehlen informed the head of internal audit that he
had resumed the use of false paperwork and payments to government officials to obtain TIPs.
Following this conversation, Ruehlen prepared a memorandum justifying his use of false

paperwork. Ruehlen sent it to the head of internal audit on or about March 31, 2005. However,

19
Ruehlen backdated the memorandum to February 10, 2005 (âBackdated Memoâ). Ruehlenâs
backdating made it appear that he had notified internal audit before resuming the use of false
paperwork, rather than after he had authorized the customs agent to obtain false paperwork TIPs
and pay bribes.

76. In his Backdated Memo, Ruehlen stated that: (1) NCS had denied Noble-
Nigeriaâs request for a fourth extension, and fourth extensions were not allowed; (2) NCS
required Noble-Nigeria to export and re-import rigs, even if they were still on contract; (3)
Noble-Nigeria required a new TIP for rigs that might otherwise be eligible for an extension, if
they were under a new contract; (4) exporting and re-importing the rigs would be costly and
impractical because the rigs would be off-contract for up to 30 days; and (5) Ruehlen had
decided the best way to maintain drilling under contracts was to use false paperwork to obtain
the new TIPs.

77. In his Backdated Memo, Ruehlen also informed the head of internal audit that
converting the rigs to permanent import status was ânot practicalâ or economical in part because
âall cost implications are not transparent.â

78. In his Backdated Memo, Ruehlen stated that Nigerian law âdoes not allow for a
rig to be on temporary importation in Nigeria for more than two and one-half years at a time and
only temporarily imported for one contract period.ââ Ruehlen stated that the two and one-half
year time period directly conflicted with the typical two-to-five year period of a drilling contract.
Ruehlen stated, â[t]his situation has been exploited by the customs authority and used to pressure
contractors into paying a high price to maintain the rigs in country for contract duration in excess

of two and one half years.â Ruehlen said that moving a rig out of Nigeria every two and one half

20
years was ânot feasibleâ because the process would take âfour to six weeks at bestâ and the
parties to the drilling contract would not accept a rig being off contract for that long.

79. In the Backdated Memo, Ruehlen stated that the customs agent required âspecial
handlingâ charges to obtain false paperwork TIPs, and he attached the price proposal from the
customs agent.

80. On or about April 26, 2005, the customs agent sent Ruehlen the invoices for the
three false paperwork TIPs. Each invoice itemized âspecial handlingâ charges in the amount of
1,900,000 Naira that the customs agent had paid to government officials at Ruehlenâs and Noble-
Nigeriaâs request and authorization to obtain the false paperwork TIPs. The false documents
showed the rigâs movement out of and back into Nigerian waters, even though the rig never
moved. Attached to the invoice were receipts dated between March 2 and 10, 2005 from the
Nigerian Port Authority and the National Maritime Authority evidencing âexportâ of the rigs
through the port of Calabar. Because the rigs never moved, these receipts and other false
evidence of âexportâ were obtained through Nobleâs and Noble-Nigeriaâs illicit payments to
government officialsâthe âspecial handlingâ charges authorized by Ruehlen.

81. On May 9, 2005, NCS granted Noble-Nigeria new TIPs for the three rigs
procured through false paperwork and payment of âspecial handlingâ charges. NCS expressly
conditioned the TIPs on eleven action items, which included providing NCS with the date of
importation, completing certain government forms and other documents evidencing importation
of the rig and its value, promising not to allow the rig to be sold or kept in Nigeria for hire or
reward, obtaining a bank bond for the full value of the duties owed, and exporting the rig within

twelve months of importation.

21
82. Having received the TIPs and the invoices for the âexportâ portion of the false
paperwork TIPs, Ruehlen sought Jacksonâs approval on or about May 16, 2005 to pay the
âspecial handlingâ charges of 1,900,000 Naira for each rig. According to Nobleâs policies and
procedures, Jackson was responsible for reviewing and approving all payments to government
officials. Ruehlen had violated policy by failing to obtain Jacksonâs approval for âspecial
handlingâ charges before authorizing the customs agent in February 2005 to make the payments.

83. Jackson responded to Ruehlenâs request on or about May 17, 2005, stating that he
was âOK with approving,â but wanted the head of internal audit to clarify the 2004 West Africa
Division Auditâs finding concerning a false paperwork TIP and subsequent resolution.

84. The head of internal audit e-mailed Ruehlen and Jackson on or about May 17,
2005, summarizing the 2004 West Africa Division Audit finding, as well as the resolution
presented to the Audit committee, stating that Noble-Nigeria would not use false paperwork and
would physically export the rigs to obtain new TIPs. The head of internal audit asked Ruehlen to
explain why he had decided to resume the use of false paperwork and payments to government
officials in contravention of the resolution.

85. The same day, Ruehlen sent his explanation to both the head of internal audit and
Jackson. Ruehlen stated that physically exporting and re-importing the rigs was not feasible
because the rigs would be off contract for at least four to six weeks, plus tow time. Ruehlen
explained that such a long time off-contract would be costly and might lead to cancellation of
contracts. Ruehlen stated: âThe only way to keep the rig working on contract and get the new
temporary import document in place is to use the method of exporting and importing the rig on
paper while in fact the rig does not leave Nigerian waters.â Ruehlen added that other drilling

contractors used the same method.

22
86. In late May 2005, Ruehlen and other Noble-Nigeria employees took steps to pay
the customs agentâs invoices for the three false paperwork TIPs. Ruehlen signed a check, dated
May 18, 2005, paying the invoice, including the âspecial handlingâ charges.

87. In violation of Noble policy, Ruehlen had not received Jacksonâs approval before
he signed the check and processed payment of the âspecial handlingâ charges.

88. On May 25, 2005, Jackson confirmed his approval to the head of internal audit,
who conveyed the approval to Ruehlen. On or about May 25, 2005, Noble-Nigeria, with
Ruehlenâs and Jacksonâs knowledge and approval, posted the âspecial handlingâ charges to
accounts for legitimate operating expenses, causing Nobleâs books and records to be false.

89. Jackson approved the âspecial handlingâ payments, and Ruehlen reimbursed the
agent for the payments, to ensure that Noble and Noble-Nigeria retained business under drilling
contracts, even though they knew that using false paperwork to obtain TIPs was wrong, violated
Nigerian law, and was against Noble policy.

90. Neither Jackson nor Ruehlen informed the Audit Committee or any member of
the Board of Directors that they had resumed using false paperwork to obtain TIPs or that they
made related illicit payments to government officials.

91. On or about May 25, 2005, Ruehlen and Jackson agreed on a plan to streamline
the approval process for Noble-Nigeriaâs numerous, typically small, and almost daily payments
to government officials. Having centralized all financial responsibility for Noble-Nigeria in his
office, Ruehlen knew what Noble-Nigeria was paying to government officials. Under the plan,
Ruehlen would send Jackson a quarterly report detailing the prior quarterâs payments to
government officials, and also requesting blanket pre-approval of payments in the current quarter

under a projected cumulative total. TIP-related payments were included in the report of prior

23
quarter payments, but would not receive blanket pre-approval. Jackson and Ruehlen knew that
âspecial handlingâ charge payments to government officials for TIPs and extensions were large,
unusual, non-routine payments that required separate and specific approvals.

92. In or about September 2005, Ruehlen received the final invoices for the import
portion of the three false paperwork TIPs. These invoices each contained a âprocurementâ
charge in the amount of 5,000,000 Naira. This âprocurementâ charge was not supported by
documentation, and Ruehlen understood that it was for payments to government officials to
obtain false paperwork TIPs, equivalent to âspecial handlingâ charges. Each invoice also
contained line-items for port charges in Cameroon, charges for the âcertificate of clearance,â
Nigerian Port Authority âinward charges,â National Maritime Authority âinward charges,â and
Intels royalty charges for the outward and inward âmovementâ of the rigs. The customs agentâs
agency fee was 500,000 Naira and the VAT on the agency fee was 25,000 Naira. Because the
rigs never moved, the receipts and other documents showing âimportâ were false and obtained
through bribes to government officials that Ruehlen authorized in February 2005.

93. On or about September 16, 2005, Ruehlen asked Jackson to approve payment of
the 5,000,000 Naira per rig âprocurementâ charge. Ruehlen told Jackson that the 5,000,000
Naira charge per rig was a âspecial handlingâ charge and that the total âspecial handlingâ
charges were about $112,000 for all three rigs together.

94. Jackson approved payment of the âspecial handlingâ or âprocurementâ charges on
September 16, 2005. Jackson understood that the charges were for payments to government
officials to obtain TIPs through false paperwork and to retain drilling contracts.

95. In late September 2005, Ruehlen signed a check dated September 21, 2005

paying the invoices, including the âprocurementâ payments to government officials to obtain

24
false paperwork TIPs. Noble-Nigeria, with Ruehlenâs and Jacksonâs knowledge and approval,
improperly booked the payments as legitimate operating expenses, which caused Nobleâs books
and records to be false.

V. Defendants Jackson and Ruehlen Continued to Authorize and Pay Bribes to
Obtain False Paperwork TIPs and TIP Extensions

96. On or about May 16, 2005, the customs agent notified Ruehlen that a rigâs second
TIP extension was about to expire. The agent sent a price proposal for obtaining a discretionary
third TIP extension. The proposal showed two charges: 5,000,000 Naira in âspecial handlingâ
charges, and 350,000 Naira in agency fees. Without CFO pre-approval and in contravention of
Nobleâs policy, Ruehlen told the customs agent to seek the third extension and pay government
officials to ensure the favorable processing and grant of the discretionary third extension.
Ruehlen prepared and signed the extension application on or about May 18, 2005.

97. On June 13, 2005, NCS granted the third TIP extension, which on its face stated
that it was the last and final extension. NCS directed Noble-Nigeria to export the rig or pay
permanent duties on or before December 10, 2005, or risk forfeiture of the rig.

98. Ruehlen received the customs agentâs invoice on or about June 22 or 23, 2005 and
asked Jackson to approve the 5,000,000 Naira âspecial handlingâ charges. Jackson approved the
payment on June 23, 2005.

99. Ruehlen processed the invoice and signed a check dated June 30, 2005, paying it
in full. Noble-Nigeria, with Ruehlenâs and Jacksonâs knowledge and approval, improperly
posted the âspecial handlingâ amount to accounts for legitimate operating expenses, which
caused Nobleâs books and records to be false.

100. On or about June 27, 2005, Ruehlen sent Jackson his quarterly request for blanket

pre-approval of up to $45,000 for small, routine payments to government officials in the current

25
quarter. Ruehlenâs request included detailed payments for the prior two quarters, including TIP-
related payments. The report showed that the TIP-related payments for the three false paperwork
TIPs that Jackson had approved in May 2005 almost equaled the total amount of all other
payments to government officials requested for the current quarter. On or about July 8, 2005,
Jackson approved the blanket pre-approval request for non-TIP related payments.

101. Jackson became COO in March 2005, but continued to act as the CFO until a
replacement was found in October 2005. As COO, Jackson was responsible for Nobleâs world-
wide operations. After the Vice President of Eastern Hemisphere Operations left in early May
2005, Jackson also had direct supervisory responsibility for Noble-Nigeria and had regular
contact with Ruehlen. Even after the new CFO was hired in October 2005, Jackson continued to
know the status of rigs in Nigeria, and he knew from May 2005 through May 2007 that Noble-
Nigeria sought discretionary TIP extensions and new false paperwork TIPs through illicit
payments to foreign officials.

102. Inor about October and November 2005, Ruehlen requested and the new CFO
approved a quarterly blanket pre-approval of non-TIP related payments to government officials
up to a cumulative ceiling of $45,000 for the fourth quarter. Ruehlenâs request reported that TIP-
related payments for the three false paperwork TIPs, which Jackson had approved in September,
alone totaled about $112,000, and all other prior quarter payments totaled less than $45,000.
Ruehlen told the CFO that Jackson had approved the $45,000 level for the prior quarter. On
November 17, 2005, the CFO approved Ruehlenâs request, stating that his approval was based on
prior spending levels.

103. On or about November 24, 2005, the customs agent told Ruehlen that a rigâs third

and last extension would expire on December 10, 2005 and asked for instructions. Ruehlen told

26
the agent to submit a price proposal for obtaining a new TIP using false paperwork. The agentâs
proposal included âspecial handlingâ charges of 2,200,000 Naira for the false export, and
included âprocurementâ charges of 5,000,000 Naira for the false re-import and new TIP. On or
about December 12, 2005, Ruehlen asked the new CFO to approve the âspecial handlingâ and
âprocurementâ charges totaling approximately $55,384. Ruehlen told the CFO that â[t]hese
payments are the same as we have paid in the past for this process.â

104. The new CFO approved the payments on or about December 12 or 13, 2005. He
based his approval in part on the fact that Jackson had previously reviewed and approved similar
payments as CFO. Neither Jackson nor Ruehlen told the new CFO that the payments were for
processing false paperwork or that they violated Noble policy and Nigerian law, and were
contrary to representations made to the Audit Committee in 2004.

105. In or about December 2005, Ruehlen authorized the customs agent to obtain the
false paperwork TIP and pay the proposed âspecial handlingâ or âprocurementâ charges.
Ruehlen prepared and signed the written application for the TIP, dated December 28, 2005,
which falsely represented that the rig was outside Nigeria awaiting import when, in truth, the rig
was in Nigeria.

106. In or about January 2006, Ruehlen and Noble-Nigeria received the âCancellation
of Bondâ for the rig from NCS, dated January 16, 2006. The NCS cancelled the bond based on
documentary âevidence of re-exportation of the vesselâ as of about December 14, 2005. On
January 24, 2006, the NCS approved Ruehlenâs false TIP application dated December 28, 2005
and granted a new TIP. As with all TIPs Noble-Nigeria had obtained, the new TIP was
conditioned on several items, including completion of documents evidencing importation of the

rig and the exportation of the rig within twelve months of import, and the submission of a bank

27
bond covering the full amount of duties. Noble-Nigeria, with the assistance of its customs
agent, obtained false documents as evidence of importation and secured the bond. Because the
rig never left Nigerian waters, all evidence of export and re-import was false and obtained
through payment of bribes to government officials authorized and approved by Ruehlen, Noble
and Noble-Nigeria.

107. âIn or about January 2006, Ruehlen took steps to obtain a false paperwork TIP for
another rig. Ruehlen obtained price proposals for the âimportâ and âexportâ portions of the false
paperwork from the customs agent. These proposals included âprocurementâ and âspecial
handlingâ charges to be paid to government officials totaling 7,200,000 Naira, or about $55,384.
On or about January 18, 2006, Ruehlen asked the CFO to approve the 7,200,000 Naira in
payments to government officials. Ruehlen told the CFO that â[t]hese payments are the same as
we have paid in the past for this process.â The CFO approved the payments on or about January
18, 2006. The CFO based his approval in part on the fact that Jackson had previously reviewed
and approved similar payments while he was CFO. Neither Jackson nor Ruehlen told the CFO
what the payments were for or that they violated Noble policy, Nigerian law, and were contrary
to representations made to the Audit Committee in 2004.

108. In or about late January or early February, Ruehlen authorized the customs agent
to obtain the false paperwork TIP, including making payments to Nigerian officials to secure the
illicit TIP. He also prepared and signed the TIP application representing that the rig was outside
Nigeria awaiting import, when he knew the rig was in Nigeria.

109. On February 10, 2006, NCS issued a âCancellation of Bondâ based on false
evidence of the rigâs export. On March 7, 2006, NCS granted the new TIP based on the false

paperwork. As with all TIPs Noble-Nigeria had obtained, the new TIP was conditioned on

28
several items, including completion of documents evidencing importation of the rig and the
exportation of the rig within twelve months of import, and the submission of a bank bond
covering the full amount of duties. Noble-Nigeria, with the assistance of its customs agent, then
obtained in or about May 2006 the false evidence of importation and secured the bond. Because
the rig never left Nigerian waters, all âevidenceâ of export and re-import was false and obtained
through payment of bribes to government officials authorized and approved by Ruehlen, Noble,
and Noble-Nigeria.

110. Onor about May 2, 2006, Ruehlen received the customs agentâs invoices for the
export portion of the two false paperwork TIPs. The invoices listed charges for âNigeria Ports
Authorityâ outwards, âNMA charges outwards,â âIntels outwards and inwards royalty charges,â
and charges for preparing documents showing outward movement of the rigs. â[S]pecial
handling charges outwards/inwardsâ were listed on the invoice in the amount of 2,200,000 Naira
for each rig. The customs agentâs fee for âclearing/shipping (outwards) was 500,000 Naira.
The VAT on the agentâs fee was 25,000 Naira. Because the rigs never left Nigerian waters, all
charges, receipts, and documents evidencing their âexportâ were false and obtained by paying
government officials bribes authorized and approved by Ruehlen, Noble, and Noble-Nigeria.

111. Shortly after receiving them, Ruehlen approved payment of the two invoices
containing the âspecial handlingâ charges. Noble-Nigeria, with Ruehlenâs knowledge and
approval, improperly booked the payments as legitimate operating expenses, causing Nobleâs
books and records to be false.

112. Onor about June 7, 2006, Ruehlen and Noble-Nigeria received the customs
agentâs invoices for the import portion of the two false paperwork TIPs. The invoices contained

charges and receipts for âtowingâ the rigs outward and inward, port charges during export in

29
Cameroon, and charges for âinwardsâ processing by the Nigerian Ports Authority and National
Maritime Authority. The invoices also listed charges for âlogistics for physical examination by
all agencies.â The âprocurement of new Temporary Importation Permitâ charge for each rig was
5,000,000 Naira and lacked any support or documentation. The agency fees for âinwards
clearingâ and âshippingâ were 500,000 Naira, and the VAT on the agency fee was 25,000 Naira.
Because the rigs never left Nigerian waters, all charges, receipts, and documents evidencing the
âimportâ of the rigs were false and were obtained by paying government officials bribes
authorized and approved by Ruehlen, Noble, and Noble-Nigeria.

113. Onor about June 20, 2006, Ruehlen took steps to pay the two invoices, including
the two âprocurementâ payments of 5,000,000 Naira. Ruehlen and Noble and Noble-Nigeria
employees understood that the âprocurementâ charges were âspecial handlingâ payments to
government officials to obtain favorable action on false paperwork. Nevertheless, on June 27,
2006, Noble-Nigeria, with Ruehlenâs knowledge and approval, improperly posted the payments
to accounts for legitimate operating expenses, causing Nobleâs books and records to be false.

114. Inor about March 2006, the new Noble CFO resigned, and Jackson again became
acting CFO with direct responsibility for reviewing and approving payments to foreign officials.

115.  Onor about May 16, 2006, Jackson approved 3,000,000 Naira, or about $23,256,
in payments to government officials to obtain a second TIP extension on a rig. Jackson knew
when he approved the payments that they would go to government officials, would lack any
documentation or receipts, and would ensure favorable NCS action on Noble-Nigeriaâs
application for the second TIP extension. Ruehlen and other Noble-Nigeria employees paid the
customs agentâs invoice, including the 3,000,000 Naira in âspecial handlingâ charges. Ruehlen

and Jackson knew that the 3,000,000 Naira was paid to government officials to ensure the

30
favorable action on the second extension. Nevertheless, Noble-Nigeria, with Ruehlenâs and
Jacksonâs knowledge and approval, improperly posted the payments to accounts for legitimate
operating expenses, which caused Nobleâs books and records to be false.

116. In mid or late July 2006, Jackson received Ruehlenâs quarterly request for blanket
pre-approval of non-TIP related payments to government officials. This request was for a
cumulative quarterly ceiling of $50,000. Ruehlenâs request included information about all
second quarter payments to government officials, including TIP-related payments. It included
the May and June payments for two false paperwork TIPs, as well as a number of other TIP-
related payments from other quarters that had been amortized. The total of TIP-related payments
to government officials booked in the second quarter was approximately 12,046,673 Naira or
about $93,876. Jackson did not immediately respond to Ruehlenâs request, despite his
responsibility as CFO to review and to approve or deny. In or about September 2006, Jackson
permitted another Noble executive to approve Ruehlenâs request.

117. Onor about October 19, 2006, Ruehlen received a price proposal from the
customs agent including âspecial handlingâ charges of 1,750,000 Naira to obtain a discretionary
third TIP extension. The other charges on the proposal were the agentâs fee of 250,000 Naira
and the VAT on the agency fee of 12,500 Naira. Ruehlen understood that the âspecial handlingâ
charges were payments to government officials that would lack support or documentation.
Instead of sending the price proposal to Jackson for pre-approval, Ruehlen sent it to the Noble
executive who had approved Ruehlenâs last quarterly blanket pre-approval request. Ruehlen
asked the executive to approve the âspecial handlingâ charge, stating that it âis in line with
payments made in the past for the handling of temporary imports for this unit.ââ Soon thereafter,

Ruehlen learned that the âspecial handlingâ charges for the third extension had been increased to

31
3,000,000 Naira. Ruehlen asked the executive to approve the revised âspecial handlingâ charges,
which Ruehlen estimated to equal about $23,438. The executive did not respond to Ruehlen and
did not approve the payment.

118. Ruehlen, in contravention of Noble policy, told the customs agent to secure the
discretionary third TIP extension and make the related payments to foreign officials. On October
30, 2006, the NCS granted the discretionary third TIP extension for the rig. The grant papers
stated that this was the last and final extension and directed Noble-Nigeria to export the rig on or
before May 2, 2007, or risk forfeiting the rig.

119. On or about November 1, 2006, Ruehlen received an invoice for the
discretionary third TIP extension listing three charges: (1) 3,000,000 Naira for âtemporary
import extension approvalâ; (2) 500,000 Naira for agency fee; and (3) 25,000 Naira in VAT on
the agency fee. Ruehlen still lacked approval from the CFO or any senior executive. In
contravention of Noble policy, he had Noble-Nigeria process and pay the invoice, including the
3,000,000 Naira in payments to government officials. Payment of the invoice was posted in
Noble-Nigeriaâs books on or about November 3, 2006. Ruehlen understood that the 3,000,000
Naira in payments was to obtain favorable government action on Noble-Nigeriaâs application for
a third extension. Despite this fact, Ruehlen allowed Noble-Nigeria to improperly post the
3,000,000 Naira to accounts for legitimate operating expenses, causing Nobleâs books and
records to be false.

120. Noble hired a new CFO in early November 2006. On or about November 13,
2006, Ruehlen sent the new CFO two TIP-related requests to approve payments to government
officials. One request asked the CFO to approve âspecial handlingâ charges to obtain second

extensions for three rigs, which charges equaled 1,600,000 Naira, or $12,500, per rig, or a total

32
of about $37,500 for all three rigs. Ruehlenâs request stated that the payments were the same as
what had been paid in the past.

121. Ruehlenâs second TIP-related request asked the CFO to approve payment of
âspecial handlingâ charges for the discretionary third extension that Ruehlen had initiated in
October without pre-authorization. However, Ruehlen stated that the âspecial handlingâ charges
were only 1,750,000 Naira, not the 3,000,000 Naira that Ruehlen had previously authorized the
customs agent to pay to government officials. Ruehlen did not tell the CFO that he had
unilaterally authorized and paid the âspecial handlingâ charges.

122. After receiving these requests from Ruehlen, the new CFO raised concerns about
his qualifications to approve these payments. In or about November 2006, the CFO
communicated his concerns to Jackson, who was then Nobleâs CEO, President and COO, a
member of the Board of Directors, and Nobleâs former CFO. The new CFO continued to raise
concerns about the approval process for several months.

123. In or about November 2006, Jackson told the new CFO to rely on the advice of
Nobleâs then-Controller, who had been the head of internal audit until September 2005. Jackson
told the CFO to approve the TIP-related payments to government officials if the Controller also
approved. Jackson knew, but did not tell the new CFO, that the then-Controller and former head
of internal audit knew that Noble-Nigeria used false paperwork and large, unreceipted payments
to government officials to obtain TIPs and extensions, and that he had approved such payments
in the past. Jackson took no further action on the new CFOâs concerns.

124. Asaresult of Jacksonâs instruction, the new CFO relied on the Controllerâs initial

approval to give his own approval of Ruehlenâs requests to authorize and make âspecial

33
handlingâ charge payments. The Controller approved Ruehlenâs two November 2006 TIP-
related requests, as did the CFO.

125. In or about late January or early February 2007,â Ruehlen requested and received
approval to pay âspecial handlingâ charges of 1,600,000 Naira, or about $12,500, for each of two
first TIP extensions on different rigs.

126. In or about February 2007, Ruehlen decided to seek a fourth extension for a rig.
Ruehlen knew that NCS did not grant fourth extensions, that Noble-Nigeria and others had
previously been denied fourth extensions, and that the terms of the rigâs third extension required
Noble-Nigeria to export the rig on or before May 2, 2007. Ruehlen hired a new customs agent to
handle the fourth extension application and gave the new agent relevant documents. The new
customs agent told Ruehlen that the fourth extension would require payment of 7,000,000 Naira
in âprocurementâ charges and an agency fee of 500,000 Naira. Ruehlen understood that the
âprocurementâ charges were undocumented payments to foreign officials to induce them to grant
the illicit extension.

127. Onor about April 11, 2007, Ruehlen asked Nobleâs CFO to approve the
âprocurementâ charges of 7,000,000 Naira, or about $54,687, for payments to government
officials to obtain the fourth extension. Ruehlen stated that Noble-Nigeria had never received a
fourth extension so he had no historical cost comparison, but that the 7,000,000 Naira was
similar to the cost âto renew a Temporary Import for one of the rigs.â The CFO approved

payment on April 11, 2007.

 

' By the end of January 2007, the Controller had returned to his duties as the head of internal
audit, but continued to give prior approvals of âspecial handlingâ charges for the new CFO. He
was the head of internal audit from January 2007 to about January 2008.

128. Ruehlen was deceptive in his request for approval in that he compared the
âspecial handlingâ cost of the fourth extension to the high cost of obtaining false paperwork
TIPs, not to the much lower cost of obtaining extensions. Ruehlen also omitted to tell the CFO
that NCS did not grant fourth extensions as a matter of policy, that Noble and other contractors
had been denied fourth extensions, and that the terms of the third extension for this rig
specifically required Noble-Nigeria to export the rig on or before May 2, 2007.

129. Following the CFOâs approval, Ruehlen authorized the customs agent to get the
fourth extension and make the âprocurementâ payments to government officials. NCS granted
the fourth extension on April 30, 2007.

130. On or about May 22, 2007, the customs agent gave Noble-Nigeria its invoice for
the fourth extension, seeking reimbursement of 7,000,000 Naira in payments to government
officials, which were listed as unspecified fourth extension fees, and payment of 500,000 Naira
in agency fees, and 25,000 Naira in VAT on the agency fees. Because Nobleâs Audit
Committee, in or about May 2007, had begun an internal investigation into payments to
government officials for TIPs and TIP extensions, the invoice ultimately was not paid.

131. Beginning in March 2007, Ruehlen took steps to obtain false paperwork TIPs
for three rigs with second extensions due to expire in May. Ruehlen prepared and signed TIP
applications for the three rigs, falsely representing that the three rigs were not in Nigeria, and he
requested price proposals from the customs agent.

132. Between about April 11 and April 16, 2007, the customs agent sent Ruehlen its
price proposals, stating that there would be âspecial handlingâ charges of 2,200,000 Naira per rig
for the outwards and inwards movements, and âprocurementâ charges of 5,000,000 Naira per rig.

Ruehlen understood that the âspecial handlingâ and âprocurementâ charges would be

35
undocumented and unreceipted payments to Nigerian officials to induce them to grant the
improper false paperwork TIPs.

133. Onor about April 16, 2007, Ruehlen requested approval to pay 7,200,000 Naira
per rig, or about $117,189 total for all three rigs, in âspecial handlingâ charges for the three false
paperwork TIPs. Ruehlen knew that these charges were for undocumented payments to
Nigerian officials to induce them to grant the improper TIPs.

134. Also in April 2007, Ruehlen authorized the customs agent to obtain the three false
paperwork TIPs, and to pay government officials to process false paperwork and grant the illicit
TIPs. Ruehlen helped prepare the false paperwork.

135. On April 25, 2007, NCS issued âCancellation of Temporary Importation Bondâ
notices based on âevidenceâ of the three rigs being exported through Calabar port. Because the
three rigs never actually left Nigerian waters, the evidence of âexportâ was false, and had been
obtained through bribes, authorized and approved by Ruehlen, Noble, and Noble-Nigeria.

136. On May 4, 2007, the customs agent sent Ruehlen invoices for the export portion
of the false paperwork TIPs for the three rigs. The invoices contained charges for âNMA
charges outward,â âIntels royalty charges outwards,â and other charges for preparing false
documents showing export of the rigs. The âspecial handling outwards/inwardsâ charges totaled
2,200,000 Naira for each rig. The customs agentâs fee for âoutwards (clearing/shipping)â was
500,000 Naira per rig, and the VAT on the agentâs fee was 25,000 Naira per rig. Because the
three rigs never actually left Nigerian waters, all charges, receipts, and documents relating to
their âexportâ were false and obtained through bribes, authorized and approved by Ruehlen,

Noble, and Noble-Nigeria.

36
137. Because Nobleâs Audit Committee, in or about May 2007, had begun an internal
investigation into payments to Nigerian officials for TIPs and TIP extensions, the invoices for
the export portion of the three false paperwork TIPs ultimately went unpaid.

VI. Defendant Ruehlen Falsified FCPA Compliance Certifications and Lied in Internal
Representation Letters

138. In February 2007, Ruehlen received an e-mail from the head of internal audit
containing a news report about prosecutions of other oil companies for violating the FCPA by
paying Nigerian officials for fast customs clearance. The head of internal audit told Ruehlen that
the Audit Committee would want an FCPA update each quarter, and that he was concerned that
the 2004 West Africa Division Audit resolution concerning a false paperwork TIP had not been
recently reviewed. He asked Ruehlen if the customs agent had signed an agreement to comply
with the FCPA and granted Noble-Nigeria audit rights.

139. Ruehlen looked for the agreement with the customs agent but could not find it.
He obtained a draft, unexecuted copy from Nobleâs corporate offices. Although the agreement
required the customs agent to sign annual certifications of compliance with the FCPA, Ruehlen
never obtained them.

140. In February 2007, Ruehlen sent the customs agent a copy of the annual
certification form from the draft agreement and asked the customs agent to sign certifications for
2004 and 2005. On or about February 22, 2007, Ruehlen received the signed customs agentâs
certifications, which were backdated to July 13, 2005 and July 20, 2006. Ruehlen did not tell
anyone that the certifications were backdated and passed them off as signed on the date
indicated.

141. Ruehlen also repeatedly prepared and signed quarterly representation letters to

Nobleâs upper management falsely stating that Noble-Nigeria had: (1) complied with all Internal

37
Audit action items and resolutions; (2) complied with Nobleâs Code of Business Conduct; (3) not
violated any laws or regulations; and (4) not violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Ruehlen
made these representations in each quarterly letter dated from April 13, 2005 through May 3,
2007. Contrary to his representations, Ruehlen knew that Noble-Nigeria kept rigs on contract by
using false paperwork and paying bribes to government officials to obtain illicit TIPs and
extensions in violation of an Internal Audit resolution, Nobleâs Code of Business Conduct, and
Nigerian law.

VII. Jackson Concealed the Use of False Paperwork and Bribes From Nobleâs Audit
Committee and External Auditors and Signed False Certifications

142. Jackson knew that the use of false paperwork and bribes to obtain TIPs and
extensions violated Noble policy, Nigerian law, and the resolution presented to the Audit
Committee concerning the TIP finding of the 2004 West Africa Division Audit.

143. Although Jackson had regular contact with the Audit Committee and the Board of
Directors, he did not inform the Audit Committee or any board member before May 2007 that he
had authorized the use of false paperwork and authorized payments to government officials to
obtain illicit TIPs and extensions.

144. From about May 2007 through June 2008, the Audit Committee conducted an
internal investigation into Noble-Nigeriaâs operations and payments to government officials for
TIPs and TIP extensions. Jackson refused to give information to investigators and resigned from
the company while the investigation was ongoing.

145. Jackson signed false annual and quarterly management representation letters to
Nobleâs independent auditors, including on August 5, 2005, November 9, 2005, March 13, 2006,
May 9, 2006, August 8, 2006, November 8, 2006, February 27, 2007, and May 9, 2007. In these

letters, Jackson falsely stated that: (1) he was unaware of any FCPA violations by Noble or its

38
subsidiaries; (2) he was unaware of any other violations of law; (3) he had maintained effective
internal controls; (4) there were no material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting; and (5) he was unaware of any fraud or suspected fraud affecting Noble, among other
things. Contrary to his representations, Jackson knew that: (1) he had authorized the use of false
paperwork and payments to government officials to obtain TIPs; (2) using false paperwork and
bribes violated Nigerian law, the 2004 West Africa Division Audit resolution about TIPs
presented to the Audit Committee, and Noble policies; and (3) the bribes were improperly
recorded as legitimate operating expenses.

146. From 2005 through February 2007, Jackson also signed false personal
certifications as CFO and as CEO that were attached to Nobleâs public quarterly and annual
filings, including certifications dated on August 8, 2005, May 9, 2006, August 8, 2006,
November 8, 2006, February 28, 2007, and May 9, 2007. These personal certifications falsely
stated that he had disclosed to Nobleâs auditors and Audit Committee all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls and any fraud, among
other things. In truth, he had not disclosed the use of false paperwork and bribes to obtain illicit
TIPs and extensions to keep rigs on contract and retain business, or the improper booking of
bribes as legitimate business expenses.

VIII. Defendants Jackson and Ruehlen Improperly Recorded Bribes as Legitimate
Operating Expenses

147. Noble-Nigeria improperly recorded its payments to Nigerian government officials
to obtain illicit TIPs and extensions in legitimate operating expense accounts. These accounts
consolidated into Nobleâs Statement of Income as legitimate operating expenses.

148. Jackson and Ruehlen knew of and approved the improper recording of bribes as

legitimate operating expenses.

39
149. By causing bribes to be improperly recorded as legitimate operating expenses,
Jackson and Ruehlen knowingly circumvented Nobleâs internal controls, knowingly created false
books and records, and caused Nobleâs financial statements to be inaccurate.

SEC Charges Three Oil Services Executives With Bribing Customs
Officials in Nigeria

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-32

Washington, D.C., Feb. 24, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three oil services executives with violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by participating in a bribery scheme to obtain illicit permits for oil rigs in Nigeria in order to retain
business under lucrative drilling contracts.

The SEC alleges that former Noble Corporation CEO Mark A. Jackson along with James J. Ruehlen, who is the current Director and Division
Manager of Nobleâs subsidiary in Nigeria, bribed customs officials to process false paperwork purporting to show the export and re-import of
oil rigs, when in fact the rigs never moved. The scheme was designed to save Noble Corporation from losing business and incurring
significant costs associated with exporting rigs from Nigeria and then re-importing them under new permits. Bribes were paid through a
customs agent for Nobleâs Nigerian subsidiary with Jackson and Ruehlenâs approval.

The SEC separately charged Thomas F. OâRourke, who was a former controller and head of internal audit at Noble. The SEC alleges that
OâRourke helped approve the bribe payments and allowed the bribes to be booked improperly as legitimate operating expenses for the
company. OâRourke agreed to settle the SECâs charges and pay a penalty.

âThese executives knowingly authorized and paid foreign officials to process false documents, and they consciously concealed the scheme
from Nobleâs audit committee,â said Gerald Hodgkins, Associate Director in the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âWhen executives bribe
government officials overseas, their misconduct puts their companies in legal peril and damages the integrity of foreign markets and the
reputation of U.S. companies abroad.â

Noble Corporation was charged with FCPA violations as part of a sweep of the oil services industry in late 2010. The company cooperated with
investigators and agreed to pay more than $8 million to settle civil and criminal cases.

According to the SECâs complaint against Jackson and Ruehlen filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the executives
who perpetrated the scheme worked at Noble Corporation and its Nigerian subsidiary Noble Drilling (Nigeria) Ltd, whose rigs operated in
Nigeria on the basis of temporary import permits granted by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). These temporary permits allowed the rigs to
be in the country for a one-year period. NCS had the discretion to grant up to three extensions lasting six months each, after which the rigs
were required to be exported and re-imported under a new temporary permit or be permanently imported with the payment of sizeable
duties.

The SEC alleges that Jackson and Ruehlen had a role in arranging, facilitating, approving, making, or concealing the bribe payments to induce
Nigerian customs officials to grant new temporary permits illegally and favorably exercise or abuse their discretion to grant permit
extensions. Together, Jackson and Ruehlen participated in paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to obtain about 11 illicit permits
and 29 permit extensions. Jackson approved the bribe payments and concealed the payments from Nobleâs audit committee and auditors.
Ruehlen prepared false documents, sought approval for the bribes, and processed and paid the bribes.

The SECâs complaint against Jackson and Ruehlen alleges they directly violated the anti-bribery provisions of Section 30A of the Securities
Exchange Act and the internal controls and false records provisions at Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act. The complaint
alleges that they aided and abetted Nobleâs violations of Section 30A and the books and records and internal controls provisions at Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The complaint further alleges that Jackson directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 by
misleading auditors and Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing false certifications of Nobleâs financial statements. He also is liable as a control
person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions by
Noble, Ruehlen, and OâRourke.

The SECâs complaint against OâRourke alleges that he aided and abetted Nobleâs violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and
internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, and that he directly violated the internal controls and false records provisions of the
Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, OâRourke consented to entry of a court order requiring him to pay a
$35,000 penalty and permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Exchange
Act and Rule 13b2-1.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Moira T. Roberts, Sharan K.S. Custer, and Colin Rand, and the litigation effort will be led by
Kenneth W. Donnelly. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

23. Since as early as 2000 to August 2008, Biomet Argentina employees paid
bribes to doctors employed by publicly owned and operated hospitals in Argentina in
exchange for sales of Biometâs medical device products. The doctors were paid

approximately 15-20 percent of each sale.
24. Prior to 2000, Argentine tax authorities required all companies, including
Biomet Argentina, to keep records of all payments made to doctors. In order to conceal
the illicit purpose of the payments, Biomet Argentina employees obtained phony invoices
from doctors stating that the payments were for professional services or consulting, when
in fact, no such services occurred. Biomet Argentina recorded the payments falsely as
âconsulting feesâ or âcommissions.â Starting in 2000, after the Argentine tax authorities
forbade tax-free payments to surgeons, Biomet Argentina employees recorded the
payments falsely as âroyaltiesâ or âother sales and marketing.â

25. Executives and auditors at Biometâs Indiana headquarters were aware of
the Argentine payments to doctors as early as 2000. For example, on February 7, 2000,
Operations Manager circulated a memo in Biometâs Miami office discussing the opening
of a direct-sales operation in Argentina, in which he included a budget allocation of â13-
20% commission to surgeon[s].â In 2001, Biomet purchased a company in Argentina
through which it would operate its direct sales business. The practice of paying the
commissions to doctors continued.

26. In 2003, Biometâs U.S.-based auditors conducted an audit of Biomet
Argentina. On February 28, 2003, Director of Internal Audit circulated an internal audit
report on Argentina to Senior Vice President and others in Biomet in Indiana in which he
stated, â[R]oyalties are paid to surgeons if requested. These are disclosed in the
accounting records as commissions.â The internal audit report described the payments to
surgeons, but only in the context of confirming that the amount paid to the surgeon was

the amount recorded on the books.
27. Internal audit took no steps to determine why royalties were paid to
doctors purchasing Biomet medical devices, or why the payments to the doctors were 15-
20 percent of sales. The internal auditors did not obtain any evidence of services
. provided for the payments. In fact, the internal audit report-concluded that there were
adequate controls in place to properly account for royalties paid to surgeons without any
supporting documentation.

28. In August 2005, Managing Director of Biomet Argentina raised concerns
regarding potential payments to customs officials and requested an internal audit. From
September 2005 to October 2005, Director of Internal Audit, Latin America Auditor, and
others from the Internal Audit, Legal, and Compliance Departments of Biomet conducted
an investigation into the allegations. |

29. On January 10, 2006, Managing Director of Biomet Argentina sent an
email to Latin America Auditor in Indiana that attached a monthly list.of payments to
doctors that were a percentage of the cost of products purchased by the doctors during the
month.

30. On February 22, 2006, Latin America Auditor circulated an internal report
on the audit to Senior Vice President, Operations Manager, and others, which stated,
âOther allegations being investigated by Biometâs legal team include fraudulent product
registration certificates, bribery of customs officials, and other charges as reported to
legal via electronic media. It was later determined that certificates were fraudulent and
bribes were made [sic].â

31. In November 2006, Latin America Auditor sent her report on the audit of

Biomet Argentina to Senior Vice President, Operations Manager and others in Indiana,
which stated, âThe commission expense recorded on the income statement is actually
royalties paid to doctors for using Biomet products. This account should be renamed to
royaltyâs [sic] expense.â Thus, despite the bribery, Latin America Auditorâs only
recommendation was to change the journal entry from âcommission expensesâ to
âroyalties.â -

32. | Biometâs U.S.-based auditors continued to get information about payments
to doctors, including payments made in cash. For example, on February 26, 2007,
Finance and Administration Manager at Biomet Argentina emailed Latin America
Auditor information regarding cash disbursements, which stated, âPayments for surgeon
commissions: the payments for surgeon commissions will be made on the 20th of each
month.â

33. In September 2007, the Commission staff sent a letter to Biomet inquiring
of payments made to public doctors. While the inquiry was underway in certain
countries, additional conduct was occurring at Biomet Argentina.

34, For example, on December 7, 2007, Sales and Marketing Manager for
Latin America sent a report on a visit to Biomet Argentina to Operations Manager, in
which he noted as an area of concern, âDoctors receive a âconsulting feeâ for every
surgery.â On February 19, 2008, a Biomet Argentina employee also sent a list of
payments made to physicians to Managing Director of Biomet Argentina.

35. In March 2008, Managing Director of Biomet Argentina again reported
the payments to surgeons to internal compliance personnel but no efforts were made by

compliance to stop the practice.
. 36. On August 7, 2008, Finance and Administration Manager sent Biomet
Argentinaâs financial report, which continued to openly reflect the 15-20% commissions
paid to surgeons, to Operations Manager and others in Indiana.

37. In August 2008, Biomet distributed new compliance guidelines that
emphasized the FCPA and related issues to its employees, including employees in
Argentina. Managing Director of Biomet Argentina reviewed the guidelines and
contacted Biometâs attorneys to inform them of Biomet Argentinaâs payments to doctors
to use Biomet products.

38. Within days, Biomet suspended the payments to Argentine doctors and
sent outside counsel to investigate the issue. In December 2008, Biomet suspended all
sales in Argentina. Biomet gradually re-entered the market in 2009. In all, Biomet paid
approximately $436,000 in payments that were provided to doctors in return for the
doctorsâ use of Biomet products.

B. Brazil

39.  Biomet sold medical devices in Brazil through its U.S. subsidiary, Biomet
International. Biomet International engaged in a scheme in which its distributor,
Brazilian Distributor, paid bribes to doctors employed by publicly owned and operated
hospitals to purchase Biometâs implants. Brazilian Distributor paid the doctors bribes in
the form of âcommissionsâ of 10-20 percent of the value of the medical devices
purchased.

40. As early as 2001, Biomet employees were aware of Brazilian Distributorâs
payments to doctors in exchange for purchasing Biomet implants. The payments were

openly discussed in documents between Brazilian Distributor, Biomet International, and
Biometâs executives and auditors in the U.S. For example, on August 15, 2001, Brazilian
Distributor sent an email to Senior Vice President in Indiana, copying Director of Internal
Audit and others, noting that Brazilian Distributor was paying âcommission [sic} to
doctors.â In February 2002, Director of Internal Audit sent a memorandum to Senior
Vice President and Operations Manager regarding a limited audit performed of the books
and records of Brazilian Distributor, in which he stated:

âBrazilian Distributor makes payments to surgeons that may be considered as

a kickback. These payments are made in cash that allows the surgeon to

receive income tax free.... The accounting entry is to increase a prepaid

expense account. In the consolidated financials sent to Biomet, these
payments were reclassified to expense in the income statement.â

41. In another example, on August 21, 2003, Brazilian Distributor emailed
Senior Vice President, copying Operations Manager, Director of Internal Audit, and
others, stating âPrepaid now was fully reclassified to expenses accounts, commissions to
doctors continue to be the major item....â

42. On February 19, 2004, a Biomet Argentina employee forwarded to
Operations Manager the 2003 financial statements of Brazilian Distributor, which
included the 20% commissions to doctors as âcommissions.â The next day, Operations
Manager forwarded the financial statements of Brazilian Distributor to Senior Vice
President. During this entire period, no efforts were made to stop the bribery.

43. In April 2008, Biomet decided to purchase Brazilian Distributor. Biomet
sent accountants and outside counsel to Brazil to conduct due diligence on Brazilian
Distributor. During the due diligence, the accountants identified cash payments to
doctors and debit card purchases on behalf of doctors that raised red flags of bribery.

When questioned by Biometâs outside counsel, Brazilian Distributor admitted that they
paid doctors for buying Biomet products and described the payments as âscientific
incentives.â Brazilian Distributor said that Biomet executives knew about the payments.

44. _ Biomet terminated its relationship with Brazilian Distributor in May 2008.
Biomet withdrew its sales from the Brazilian market and wrote off $4.2 million in
accounts receivables owed by Brazilian Distributor. In 2009, Biomet re-entered the
Brazilian market and hired new Brazilian distributors to sell its medical implants. In all,
Biomet paid approximately $1.1 million in payments that were provided to doctors in
return for the doctorsâ use of Biomet products. |

C. China

45.  Biomet sold its medical device products in China through its subsidiaries,
Biomet China and Scandimed. Biomet China and Scandimed used Chinese Distributor to
funnel bribes to doctors employed at publicly owned and operated hospitals. Chinese
Distributor provided the doctors with money and travel in exchange for their purchases of.
Biomet medical device products.

46. From at least 2001, Chinese Distributor exchanged emails with Biomet
employees that explicitly described the bribes that he was paying on Biomet Chinaâs
behalf. For example, on February 1, 200 1, Chinese Distributor sent an email to Associate
Regional Manager for Asia/Pacific in Hong Kong SAR stating that Chinese Distributor
was paying a 10-15% ârebateâ to surgeons on the sale of Biomet artificial hips. The next
day, Associate Regional Manager sent an email to a Biomet employee in the United
Kingdom, noting that Scandimed âoffer[s] higher-than-average âcommissionâ to

surgeons....â

10
47. On February 6, 2001, a Scandimed employee emailed President of
International Operations in Indiana and Biomet employees in the United Kingdom,
stating, âRe. âcommissionâ to surgeons, Scandimed has no control over this... as we
understand it, giving commission [sic] or gifts of various kinds to surgeons is common in
China.â That same day, President of International Operations responded, copying
Operations Manager, stating, â[T]he only problem with a company paying high
commissions in a tight market is that the prices must be low enough to the dist[ributor] to
allow for these high commissions...â

48. On April 10, 2001, Chinese Distributor sent an email to President of
International Operations, copying Associate Regional Manager, discussing a doctor who
was trying to stop commissions being paid to physicians by medical device companies.

49. On May 18, 2001, Chinese Distributor sent an email copying Associate
Regional Manager, stating â[Doctor] will become the most loyal customer of Biomet if
we send him to Switzerland.â

50. On May 21, 2001, Chinese Distributor sent another email to Associate
Regional Manager, copying Senior Vice President, President of International Operations,
and Operations Manager, stating:

â[Doctor] is the department head of [public hospital]. [Doctor] uses about 10
hips and knees a month and itâs on an uptrend, as he told us over dinner a
week ago.... Many key surgeons in Shanghai are buddies of his. A kind
word on Biomet from him goes a long way for us. Dinner has been set for the

evening of the 24th. It will be nice. But dinner aside, Iâve got to send him to
Switzerland to visit his daughter.â

51. Some emails described the way that vendors would deliver cash to
surgeons upon the completion of surgery. Other emails discussed the amount of

payments. For example, on January 29, 2002, Associate Regional Manager prepared a

1]
summary of distribution in China, noting, âChinese surgeons typically receive a
commission on sales, which can range from 5% to 25%. Distributors are expected to
hold banquets for surgeons, and to sponsor meetings.â

52.._ On April 21, 2002, Chinese Distributor sent an email to Associate
Regional Manager discussing payments to surgeons, stating,

âWhen we say âSurgeon Rebate includedâ, it means the invoice price includes a

predetermined percentage for the surgeon. For example, a vendor invoices the

hospital for a set of plate & screws at RMB 3,000.00. The vendor will have to
deliver RMB 750.00 (25% in this case) in cash to the surgeon upon completion of

surgery [sic].â

53. The bribery of Chinese doctors continued into 2005. For example, on
March 14, 2005, Director of Interna] Audit instructed an auditor to code improper
payments being made to doctors in connection with clinical trials as âentertainment.â In
addition, on December 28, 2005, an employee of Biomet China emailed Associate
Regional Manager, noting that doctors conducting clinical trials are paid a 10-15%
âconsulting fee.â

54. In late 2006, Biomet made a business decision to end the relationship with
Chinese Distributor and to hire its own sales staff to sell Biomet medical devices into
China. From October 6 through October 13, 2007, Biomet China sponsored the travel of
20 surgeons to Barcelona and Valencia for training, including a substantial portion of the
trip being devoted to sightseeing and other entertainment at Biometâs expense.

55. | On October 11, 2007, the product manager for Biomet China sent an email
to Associate Regional Manager discussing ways to evade efforts by the Chinese
government to halt corruption in health care by requiring all international companies to

declare actual cost for import to the government. In the email the product manager

12
stated, âObviously, China government [sic] doesnât have ability to forbid the corruption
from hospitals & surgeons...,â and then the product manager went on to propose four
methods for avoiding the regulation, including the use of falsified invoices. The product
manager was referring to efforts made in 2006 and 2007 by the Chinese authorities to
crack down on bribery, including the December 2006 arrest and July 2007 execution of
the former head of Chinaâs drug regulator.

D. Anti-Bribery Violations

56.  Biomet and its four subsidiaries knowingly allowed its employees and
third parties to pay Argentine, Brazilian and Chinese public doctors for the purpose of
obtaining or retaining business. Public doctors in Argentina, Brazil, and China are
âforeign officialsâ as the term is defined in the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

57. Biomet employees who were U.S. nationals approved the payments to
Argentine doctors and the arrangements with the Brazilian Distributor and Chinese
Distributor that included payments to doctors. The mails and instrumentalities of
interstate commerce were used in furtherance of the bribery schemes in Argentina, Brazil
and China.

E. Failure to Maintain Books and Records

58. Biomet, through its subsidiaries Biomet Argentina, Biomet International,
Biomet China, and Scandimed, made numerous illicit payments for years to public
doctors in Argentina, Brazil, and China. Biometâs books and records did not reflect the

true nature of those payments. The payments were improperly recorded as

29 66. 39 66 37> 6

âcommissions,â âroyalties,â âconsulting fees,â âother sales and marketing,â âscientific

incentives,â âtravel,â and âentertainment.â

13
F. Failure to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

59.  Biomet failed to implement internal controls to detect or prevent bribery.
Biomet and four subsidiaries were involved in bribery that lasted for over a decade. The
conduct involved employees and managers of all levels involved in Biometâs sales in
Argentina, Brazil and China. False documents were routinely created or accepted that
concealed the improper payments.

SEC Charges Medical Device Company Biomet with Foreign
Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-50

Washington, D.C., March 26, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Warsaw, Ind.-based medical device company
Biomet Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries and agents bribed public doctors in Argentina, Brazil,
and China for nearly a decade to win business.

Biomet, which primarily sells products used by orthopedic surgeons, agreed to pay more than $22 million to settle the SECâs charges as well
as parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today. The charges arise from the SEC and DOJâs ongoing proactive
global investigation into medical device companies bribing publicly-employed physicians.

The SEC alleges that Biomet and its four subsidiaries paid bribes from 2000 to August 2008, and employees and managers at all levels of the
parent company and the subsidiaries were involved along with the distributors who sold Biometâs products. Biometâs compliance and internal
audit functions failed to stop the payments to doctors even after learning about the illegal practices.

âBiometâs misconduct came to light because of the governmentâs proactive investigation of bribery within the medical device industry,â said
Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the Enforcement Divisionâs Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. âA companyâs compliance and internal audit
should be the first line of defense against corruption, not part of the problem.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C., employees of Biomet Argentina SA paid kickbacks as high as 15 to
20 percent of each sale to publicly-employed doctors in Argentina. Phony invoices were used to justify the payments, and the bribes were
falsely recorded as âconsulting feesâ or âcommissionsâ in Biometâs books and records. Executives and internal auditors at Biometâs Indiana
headquarters were aware of the payments as early as 2000, but failed to stop it.

The SEC alleges that Biometâs U.S. subsidiary Biomet International used a distributor to bribe publicly-employed doctors in Brazil by paying
them as much as 10 to 20 percent of the value of their medical device purchases. Payments were openly discussed in communications
between the distributor, Biomet International employees, and Biometâs executives and internal auditors in the U.S. For example, a February
2002 internal Biomet memorandum about a limited audit of the distributorâs books stated:

Brazilian Distributor makes payments to surgeons that may be considered as a kickback. These payments are made in

cash that allows the surgeon to receive income tax free. ...The accounting entry Is to increase a prepaid expense

account. In the consolidated financials sent to Biomet, these payments were reclassified to expense in the income

Statement.
According to the SECâs complaint, two additional subsidiaries - Biomet China and Scandimed AB - sold medical devices through a distributor
in China who provided publicly-employed doctors with money and travel in exchange for their purchases of Biomet products. Beginning as
early as 2001, the distributor exchanged e-mails with Biomet employees that explicitly described the bribes he was arranging on the
companyâs behalf. For example, one e-mail stated:

[Doctor] is the department head of [public hospital]. [Doctor] uses about 10 hips and knees a month and itâs on an

uptrend, as he told us over dinner a week ago. ...Many key surgeons in Shanghai are buddies of his. A kind word on

Biomet from him goes a long way for us. Dinner has been set for the evening of the 24th. It will be nice. But dinner

aside, Iâve got to send him to Switzerland to visit his daughter.
The SEC alleges that some e-mails described the way that vendors would deliver cash to surgeons upon completion of surgery, and others
discussed the amount of payments. The distributor explained in one e-mail that 25 percent in cash would be delivered to a surgeon upon
completion of surgery. Biomet sponsored travel for 20 Chinese surgeons in 2007 to Spain, where a substantial part of the trip was devoted to
sightseeing and other entertainment.

Biomet consented to the entry of a court order requiring payment of $4,432,998 in disgorgement and $1,142,733 in prejudgment interest.
Biomet also is ordered to retain an independent compliance consultant for 18 months to review its FCPA compliance program, and is
permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Biomet
agreed to pay a $17.28 million fine to settle the criminal charges.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Brent S. Mitchell with Tracy L. Price of the Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit and Reid A. Muoio. The
SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The investigation
into bribery in the medical device industry is continuing.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,

Plaintiff, : Civil Action No.
vs.
GARTH RONALD PETERSON,

Defendant.

 

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ or âSECâ) alleges

that:
SUMMARY

1. From at least 2004 to 2007, Defendant Garth Peterson, while employed at Morgan
Stanley & Co., Inc.âs (âMorgan Stanleyâ) real estate investment and fund advisory business,
secretly acquired millions of dollars worth of real estate investments from Morgan Stanleyâs
funds for himself, the former Chairman of Yongye Enterprise (Group) Co. (âYongyeâ)-âa
Chinese state-owned entity with influence over the success of Morgan Stanleyâs real estate
business in Shanghaiâand others. Peterson also arranged to have paid to himself and the former
Chairman of Yongye (âthe Chinese Officialâ) at least $1.8 million in what he misrepresented
were finderâs fees Morgan Stanleyâs funds owed to third parties. In exchange for offers and
payments from Peterson, the Chinese Official helped Peterson and Morgan Stanley obtain
business while personally benefitting from some of these same investments. This self-dealing
and misappropriation by Peterson breached the fiduciary duties he and Morgan Stanley owed to

their clients.
2. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Peterson violated the
anti-bribery and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(âFCPAâ)ânamely Sections 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(5) and 78dd-1]âand aided and abetted violations of the
anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ}ânamely
Sections 206(1) and 206(2) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 80b-6(1) and 80b-6(2)].

3. The Commission brings this action against Peterson seeking injunctive relief to
prevent future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement, and a civil penalty.

JURISDICTION

4, This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa] and Section 209(d) of the Advisers
Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 80b-9(d)]. The parties have consented to venue in the Eastern District of New
York.

DEFENDANT

5. Defendant Garth Peterson is a U.S. citizen and resident of Singapore who speaks
Chinese fluently. Peterson began working for Morgan Stanley in 2002 in Hong Kong. He was
made the head of the Shanghai office of Morgan Stanleyâs wholly-owned global real estate
business when that office first opened in 2006 and became a Managing Director of Morgan
Stanley in 2007. Petersonâs principal responsibility at Morgan Stanley was to evaluate,
negotiate, acquire, manage and sell real estate investments on behalf of Morgan Stanleyâs
advisers and funds. As such, he owed a fiduciary duty to the fund clients. By the time he was
terminated in 2008 in connection with the conduct described in this Complaint, Peterson had

been involved with at least twenty-eight Morgan Stanley transactions in China.
OTHER PERSONS AND ENTITES

6. Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of
business in New York, New York. It owns global asset management, investment banking and
securities businesses with more than 61,000 employees world-wide. At all pertinent times,
Morgan Stanley had a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 781(b)], had securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and was subject
to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m].

7. At all pertinent times, Morgan Stanley in part conducted its real estate investing
business through wholly-owned SEC-registered investment advisers to, and minority investors
in, approximately a half-dozen investment companies, a/k/a funds, organized as Delaware
limited partnerships. As advisers and general partners to these funds, Morgan Stanley, though its
employees, raised capital and made and managed real estate investments world-wide, and owed
fiduciary duties to their clients. The funds most pertinent to the conduct described in this
Complaint are MSREF IV International (âMSREF IVâ) and MSREF V International (ââMSREF
Vvâ), which invested in securities of real estate companies, portfolios of real estate and real estate
loans, and real estate directly. For each fund, Morgan Stanley formed a wholly-owned adviser
that it registered with the SEC with its principal office and place of business at a Morgan Stanley
address in New York, NY, and a website address of www.morganstanley.com/realestate. The
adviser for MSREF IV, named MSREF IV, LLC, was registered November 2000; the adviser for
MSREF V, named MSREF V, LLC, was registered January 3, 2005. Many of the investors in
Morgan Stanleyâs funds, including Morgan Stanley employees, were U.S. persons and many
sales of limited partnership interests in the funds occurred in the U.S.

8. At all pertinent times, Yongye Enterprise (Group) Co. Ltd. was a large real estate
development arm of the Luwan District Government in Shanghai, China. Since its inception in
1994, Yongye held leases for many prime areas in the Luwan District. Yongyeâs business was to
keep or take a small share in real estate joint ventures, including with Morgan Stanley and its
funds, in exchange for helping its joint venture partner obtain the proper licensing from the local
government. Yongye owned and developed residential and commercial real property, sold and
brokered real estate to Morgan Stanley and its funds, and partnered with Morgan Stanley and its
funds in various real estate investments.

9. The Chinese Official was the Chairman of Yongye at all pertinent times until his
retirement in September 2006. As Chairman, he exercised control over Yongye and had the
authority to make investment decisions for it. Before Yongye, the Chinese Official worked for
the Luwan District government. After his retirement in September 2006, the Chinese Official
continued to work with Morgan Stanley as a private real estate developer and broker until
approximately the time Peterson was terminated in 2008.

10. The Canadian Attorney at all times pertinent to the conduct described in this
Complaint worked in Hong Kong for law firms and for an insurance company as its chief legal
officer.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

11. Peterson began at Morgan Stanley in 2002 with a pre-existing business and
personal relationship with the Chinese Official, an experienced Shanghai real estate investor and
Chairman of the Luwan government-owned entity Yongye. Peterson led Morgan Stanleyâs
effort to build a Chinese real estate investment portfolio for its real estate funds by cultivating a
relationship with the Chinese Official to take advantage of his ability to steer opportunities to

Morgan Stanley, his familiarity with and influence in helping with needed governmental
approvals, and his real estate investment and management experience generally. During the
pertinent period, Morgan Stanley partnered with Yongye in a number of significant Chinese real
estate investments and recognized Yongye, led by the Chinese Official, as one of Morgan
Stanleyâs most significant partners in China. At the same time, Peterson and the Chinese
Official expanded their personal business dealings, both in a real estate interest secretly acquired
from Morgan Stanley, as well as by investing together in Chinese franchises of well-known U.S.
fast food restaurants. Peterson failed to disclose all these investments in annual disclosures of
personal business interests Morgan Stanley required him to make as part of his employment.

Project Cavity
[Shanghai Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced Apartments]

12. âIn 2002, in a project named âProject Wally,â MSREF IV co-invested as a
minority partner with Yongye and other investors in a dual-use, two-tower building in the Luwan
District of Shanghai. In late 2004, in a transaction called âProject Cavity,â MSREF IV, along
with others, purchased one of these two towers, known as the Shanghai Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced
Apartments. As one of the sellers in Project Cavity, Yongyeâs approval was required before the
sale could take place. In addition, because Yongye was the project manager for the selling
consortium, it managed the sale process. As Morgan Stanley and Peterson were negotiating the
purchase of Project Cavity in October 2004, Peterson, the Chairman of Yongye (the Chinese
Official) and the Canadian Attorney secretly were planning to purchase an interest from MSREF
IV after MSREF IV purchased the tower from the selling consortium. As the vehicle for
purchasing and holding their interest, Peterson, the Chinese Official and the Canadian Attorney
used a British Virgin Islands entity called Asiasphere Holdings Ltd. (âAsiasphereâ). As
described below in paragraph 16, they misrepresented to officers and employees of Morgan
Stanley that Asiasphere was a subsidiary of Yongye. Accordingly, officers and employees of

5
Morgan Stanley who had decision making authority over whether MSREF IV would sell an
interest in Project Cavity believed that they were selling that interest to Yongye, when, in fact,
they were unknowingly selling the interest to Peterson, the Chinese Official and the Canadian
Attorney.

13. In his effort to convince Morgan Stanley and its fund to sell an interest in Project
Cavity to Asiasphereâan entity officers and employees of Morgan Stanley believed to be
YongyeâPeterson told others at Morgan Stanley that the Chinese Official, in his capacity as
Chairman of Yongye, caused the selling consortium to sell Project Cavity to Morgan Stanley at a
price that was lower than a competing offer. According to emails Peterson wrote to his Morgan
Stanley colleagues at the time MSREF IV bought Project Cavity, the Chinese Official showed
Peterson the written offer of one competing bidder in confidence âto make clear the competition
we're facingâ and had âreally gone out of his way to help [Morgan Stanley] on this deal.â In
November 2005 as the time neared for Asiasphereâs purchase from MSREF IV, Peterson told his
colleagues, âWE OWE [YONGYE] A FAVOR .. . [Yongye] gave us this deal.â (Emphasis in
original.) Peterson also credited the Chinese Official with helping obtain approvals required
from other Chinese government entities for the deal to close.

14. Peterson, the Chinese Official and the Canadian Attorney funded their nearly $3
million Cavity investment in March 2006 and, through Asiasphere, purchased approximately
12% of MSREF IVâs interest. Asiasphere paid its purchase price in U.S. Dollars to a Morgan
Stanley bank account in New York City. The Chinese Official owned 47% of Asiasphere, and
Peterson and the Canadian Attorney shared the remaining 53%âthrough their ownership, 81%
and 19% respectively, of a British Virgin Islands company called Strong Man Ltd. Peterson

controlled this 81% interest in Strong Man directly and/or through a British Virgin Islands
company called Paraplay. Altogether, Peterson had a 43% interest in Asiasphere. Asiasphere
bought 12% of Jin Lin Tiandi Holding Company, a Caymans Island Company, which owned the
Shanghai Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced Apartments as follows: Jin Lin Tiandi Holding Company
owned 100% of and controlled Sky Luck Property Corp., a British Virgin Islands Company;
which owned 100% of and controlled King Project Limited, a Hong Kong Company; which
owned 100% of and controlled Shanghai Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced Apartment Management Co.
Ltd., a Peopleâs Republic of China Company; which owned 100% of and controlled the Shanghai
Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced Apartments in Shanghai, China.

15. In negotiating both sides of the transaction, Peterson also arranged for Asiasphere
to buy its interest in Project Cavity at MSREF IVâs October 2004 basis. Accordingly,
Asiasphereâs near-$3 million investment was already in-the-money by as much as $6 million at
the time of the investment in 2006 because the property had risen in value since Morgan
Stanleyâs fund bought it in late 2004. This secret self-dealing breached the fiduciary duties
Peterson and Morgan Stanley owed to their fund client.

| 16. As enumerated below, Peterson, the Chinese Official and the Canadian
Attorneyâwho acted as Asiasphereâs attorney for the dealâlied to others at Morgan Stanley
that Yongye was the purchaser. To make Morgan Stanley believe it was selling the Cavity
interest to Yongye, Peterson, the Canadian Attorney and the Chinese Official misrepresented that
Asiasphere was an offshore subsidiary of Yongye. During the years preceding the Cavity
transaction, Morgan Stanley engaged in a number of real estate transactions involving Yongye
and had learned that Yongye conducted its business through a Hong Kong holding company and
a BVI holding company all of which Morgan Stanley employees referred to interchangeably as

Yongye, âYYâ or âYYTâ. During these years, Morgan Stanley had conducted due diligence into
Yongye, its Chairman (the Chinese Official) and its two offshore entities. As Peterson knew,
Morgan Stanleyâs due diligence included interviews with the Chinese Official and the Canadian
Attorney (who represented a Yongye entity), record reviews, and background and reference
checks. Examples of Peterson, the Chinese Official and the Canadian Attorneyâs
misrepresentations that Yongye owned Asiasphere include the following:

a. On or about October 28, 2004, Peterson sent an email to several Morgan
Stanley employees in which he explained that Yongye, and not the Chinese Official, would be
acquiring a 12-percent stake in Project Cavity, falsely writing â[j]ust to be clear, [the Chinese

Official] will not âacquire another 4.5% of sharesâ from [Morgan Stanley]. Itâs Yong Ye...â

b. On or about November 16, 2005, Peterson emailed several Morgan
Stanley employees in response to an email discussing the terms of Yongyeâs purported
investment in Project Cavity, âEveryone pls [sic] keep in mind the big picture here. YY gave us
this deal... . So we owe them a favor relating to this deal. . . . This should be very easy and

friendly.â

c. On or about November 23, 2005, Peterson sent an email to several Morgan
Stanley employees in which he described âYYTâ as âour friends who are coming in because WE

OWE THEM A FAVOR.â (Emphasis in original.)

d. At Peterson, the Chinese Official and the Canadian Attorneyâs doing, the
2006 shareholder agreement for Project Cavity used the abbreviation âYYâ to refer to

Asiasphere.

e. After the March 2006 sale, Peterson and the Canadian Attorney made

additional misrepresentations about Asiasphereâs ownership. For instance, on or about August 4,

8
2006, the Canadian Attorney falsely represented to a Morgan Stanley employee that Asiasphere
was owned by Yongye, writing âI confirm, as Asiasphereâs counsel in their acquisition of 12%
equity interests in [Project Cavity], that Asiasphere Holdings Limited is 100% beneficially
owned by Shanghai Yongye Enterprise (Group) Co., Ltd., a PRC company whose legal address
is 32nd floor, 138 Huai Hai Zong Lu, Shanghai, China.â This misrepresentation was made in
response to an inquiry from a Morgan Stanley employee pursuant to a third partyâs know-your-

customer requirements in connection with a refinancing being sought for Project Cavity.

17. Peterson never disclosed his own stake, in annual disclosures of personal business
interests Morgan Stanley required him to make as part of his employment or otherwise, until
around the time of his termination in late 2008. Morgan Stanley paid Asiasphere approximately
$2 million in at least five separate Cavity shareholder distributions from 2006 to 2008. Peterson
was entitled to approximately $860,000 of these distributions based on his ownership of
Asiasphere.

Project 138
[Shanghai Square Infiniti Mall]

18. In 2005, and without Morgan Stanleyâs knowledge, Peterson and the Canadian
Attorney secretly acquired from Morgan Stanley and its MSREF V Fund an interest in another
Luwan District real estate deal called Project 138. MSREF V acquired the retail property earlier
in 2005 and in October, at Petersonâs doing, sold 10% of it to a group of buyers led by a
Shanghai real estate designer and investor who had a prior business relationship with Morgan
Stanley (âthe Shanghai Investorâ). Without disclosure to Morgan Stanley or its fund, and
without mention in the transactional documents they prepared, Peterson and the Canadian
Attorneyâwho acted as the Shanghai Investorâs lawyerâbought approximately 1% of the

Project as part of the Shanghai Investorâs group. In fact, when others at Morgan Stanley asked
9
who the Shanghai Investorâs co-investors were, the Canadian Attorney and Peterson directed the
Shanghai Investor not to reveal their identities. Peterson also failed to disclose his stake in
Project 138 in annual disclosures of personal business interests Morgan Stanley required him to
make as part of his employment. As in Project Cavity, Peterson negotiated both sides of this
Project 138 sale to himself. While managing the Morgan Stanley staff responsible for
negotiating the sale and protecting MSREF Vâs interests, Peterson secretly helped the Shanghai
Investor and the Canadian Attorney negotiate the terms of the written purchase and sale
agreements. This secret self-dealing breached the fiduciary duties Peterson and Morgan Stanley
owed to their fund client.
The 3-2-1 Deal and Project Beatles

19. As Peterson and Asiasphere funded their investment in Project Cavity in early
2006, Morgan Stanley was negotiating at least five separate Chinese real estate investments
involving Yongye and its Chairmanâthe Chinese Official. To incentivize the Chinese Official
to help Morgan Stanley win this business and to reward the Chinese Official for all he had done
for Morgan Stanley and Peterson personallyâand despite his recognition that the Chinese
Officialâs âposition as head of [Yongye didnât] allow him to make such investmentsââPeterson,
on behalf of Morgan Stanley, invited the Chinese Official personally to invest with Morgan
Stanley and its funds in these five pending investments at a discount. Accordingly, Peterson
offered an arrangement referred to here as the 3-2-1 deal. Under the terms of the deal, Morgan
Stanley would sell the Chinese Official a 3% interest in each deal he brought to Morgan Stanley
for the cost of 2%, providing the Chinese Official a 1% discount Peterson called a âfinderâs fee.â
Peterson also promised to pay the Chinese Official an added return on any completed purchase

he called a âpromote,â to incentivize the Chinese Official to help make any acquired investments

10
profitable.

20. Project Beatles was one of the investments covered by the 3-2-1 arrangement with
the Chinese Official. It was a large-scale mixed-use development project Morgan Stanley and its
MSREF V fund negotiated and bought from the Luwan government, with Yongye as a minority
investor. In early 2006, Morgan Stanley began negotiating the purchase, which closed in
October. While Yongye was not the seller, the Luwan government asked the Chinese Official to
find potential buyers and Morgan Stanley credited him as a finder. Morgan Stanley also credited
the Chinese Official with other help on the deal, including obtaining a favorable price. Morgan
Stanley also credited the Shanghai Investor as a finder, who Morgan Stanley hired as one of the
projectâs designers and developers and who was the same person through whom Peterson bought
his secret interest in Project 138.

21. Inthe context of recommending to supervisors in Morgan Stanleyâs real estate
business that Morgan Stanley funds make at least four of these real estate acquisitions, Peterson
disclosed to these supervisors the proposed 3-2-1 arrangement with the Chinese Official in April
2006. Less than a month later, howeverâbefore the official had been paid anythingâa Morgan
Stanley employee in the controller function of Morgan Stanleyâs real estate business warned of
the bribery implications of paying the Chinese Official personally for help obtaining business.
One of Petersonâs Morgan Stanley supervisors then instructed Peterson to abandon the 3-2-1 deal
with the Chinese Official.

22. Peterson still secretly shared with the Chinese Official part of a finderâs fee
Peterson caused Morgan Stanley and its funds to pay the Shanghai Investor for Project Beatles.
Specifically, in March 2007, six months or so after the Chinese Official retired from Yongye,

Peterson caused Morgan Stanley and MSREF V to pay the Shanghai Investor a $2.2 million

11
finderâs fee. The Shanghai Investor transferred $1.6 million of this fee to Peterson, who gave
nearly $700,000 to the Chinese Official and kept the rest for himself. The Shanghai Investor
agreed to help Peterson steal these funds in exchange for his promise to help the Shanghai
Investor get future business from Morgan Stanley. Peterson kept his payment to the Chinese
Official and his own kickback a secret from his Morgan Stanley supervisors and the MSREF V
Fund. This misappropriation of funds breached the fiduciary duties Peterson and Morgan
Stanley owed to their fund client.
Morgan Stanleyâs FCPA Compliance Program and Internal Controls
23. Morgan Stanley trained Peterson on the FCPA numerous times during his
employment, as follows:
| (1) Morgan Stanley trained Peterson on anti-corruption policies and the FCPA

at least seven times between 2002 and 2008. In addition to other live and web-

based training, Peterson participated in a teleconference training conducted by

Morgan Stanleyâs Global Head of Litigation and Global Head of Morgan

Stanleyâs Anti-Corruption Group in June 2006.

(2) Morgan Stanley distributed to Peterson written training materials

specifically addressing the FCPA, which Peterson maintained in his office.

(3) A Morgan Stanley compliance officer specifically informed Peterson in
_ 2004 that employees of Yongye, a Chinese state-owned entity, were government

officials for purposes of the FCPA.

(4) Peterson received from Morgan Stanley at least thirty five FCPA-

compliance reminders. These reminders included FCPA-specific distributions;

12
circulations and reminders of Morgan Stanleyâs Code of Conduct, which included
policies that directly addressed the FCPA; various reminders concerning Morgan
Stanleyâs policies on gift-giving and entertainment; the circulation of Morgan
Stanleyâs Global Anti-Bribery Policy; guidance on the engagement of consultants;

and policies addressing specific high-risk events, including the Beijing Olympics.

(5) Morgan Stanley required Peterson on multiple occasions to certify his
compliance with the FCPA. These written certifications were maintained in

Petersonâs permanent employment record.

24. | Morgan Stanley required each of its employees, including Peterson, annually to
certify adherence to Morgan Stanleyâs Code of Conduct, which included a portion specifically
addressing corruption risks and activities that would violate the FCPA.

25. Morgan Stanley required its employees, including Peterson, annually to disclose
their outside business interests.

26. Morgan Stanley had policies to conduct due diligence on its foreign business
partners, conducted due diligence on the Chinese Official and Yongye before initially conducting
business with them, and generally imposed an approval process for payments made in the course
of its real estate investments. Both were meant to ensure, among other things, that transactions
were conducted in accordance with managementâs authorization and to prevent improper
payments, including the transfer of things of value to officials of foreign governments.

SEC Charges Former Morgan Stanley Executive with FCPA
Violations and Investment Adviser Fraud

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-78

Washington, D.C., April 25, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former executive at Morgan Stanley with
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as well as securities laws for investment advisers by secretly acquiring millions of dollars
worth of real estate investments for himself and an influential Chinese official who in turn steered business to Morgan Stanleyâs funds.

The SEC alleges that Garth R. Peterson, who was a managing director in Morgan Stanleyâs real estate investment and fund advisory business,
had a personal friendship and secret business relationship with the former Chairman of Yongye Enterprise (Group) Co. - a Chinese state-
owned entity with influence over the success of Morgan Stanleyâs real estate business in Shanghai. Peterson secretly arranged to have at
least $1.8 million paid to himself and the Chinese official that he disguised as finderâs fees that Morgan Stanleyâs funds owed to third parties.
Peterson also secretly arranged for him, the Chinese official, and an attorney to acquire a valuable Shanghai real estate interest from a
Morgan Stanley fund. Peterson was acquiring an interest from the fund but negotiated both sides of the transaction. In exchange for offers
and payments from Peterson, the Chinese official helped Peterson and Morgan Stanley obtain business while personally benefitting from
some of these same investments. Petersonâs deception, self-dealing, and misappropriation breached the fiduciary duties he owed to Morgan
Stanleyâs funds as their representative.

Peterson agreed to a settlement of the SECâs charges in which he will be permanently barred from the securities industry, pay more than
$250,000 in disgorgement, and relinquish his interest in the valuable Shanghai real estate (currently valued at approximately $3.4 million)
that he secretly acquired through his misconduct. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a related criminal case against Peterson.

âPeterson crossed the line not once, but twice. He secretly bribed a government official to illegally win business for his employer and enriched
himself in violation of his fiduciary duty to Morgan Stanleyâs clients,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement.
âThis case illustrates the SECâs commitment to holding individuals accountable for FCPA violations, particularly employees who intentionally
circumvent their company's internal controls.â

Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit, added, âAs a rogue employee who took advantage of his firm
and its investment advisory clients, Peterson orchestrated a scheme to illegally win business while lining his own pockets and those of an
influential Chinese official.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Petersonâs violations occurred from at least
2004 to 2007. His principal responsibility at Morgan Stanley was to evaluate, negotiate, acquire, manage and sell real estate investments on
behalf of Morgan Stanleyâs advisers and funds. He was terminated in 2008 due to his FCPA misconduct.

The SEC alleges that Peterson led Morgan Stanleyâs effort to build a Chinese real estate investment portfolio for its real estate funds by
cultivating a relationship with the Chinese official and taking advantage of his ability to steer opportunities to Morgan Stanley and his
influence in helping with needed governmental approvals. Morgan Stanley thus partnered with Yongye on a number of significant Chinese
real estate investments. At the same time, Peterson and the Chinese official expanded their personal business dealings both in a real estate
interest secretly acquired from Morgan Stanley as well as by investing together in Chinese franchises of well-known U.S. fast food
restaurants. Peterson failed to disclose these investments in annual disclosures that Morgan Stanley required him to make as part of his
employment.

According to the SECâs complaint, Peterson openly credited the Chinese official with helping obtain approvals required from other Chinese
government entities for a deal to close. He wrote to several Morgan Stanley employees in response to an e-mail discussing the terms of one
of Yongyeâs purported investments, âEveryone pls keep in mind the big picture here. YY gave us this deal. ... So we owe them a favor relating
to this deal. ... This should be very easy and friendly.â In another e-mail a week later, Peterson described âYYIâ as âour friends who are
coming in because WE OWE THEM A FAVOR.â

The SEC alleges that a Morgan Stanley compliance officer specifically informed Peterson in 2004 that employees of Yongye, a Chinese state-
owned entity, were government officials for purposes of the FCPA. Peterson also received at least 35 FCPA compliance reminders from
Morgan Stanley, but nonetheless committed the FCPA violations.

The SECâs complaint charges Peterson with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA, and
with aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Peterson consented to a court order
requiring him to disgorge $254,589 and relinquish to a court-appointed receiver the interest he secretly acquired from Morgan Stanleyâs fund
in the Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced Apartments. Petersonâs interest has a current estimated value of approximately $3.4 million. The proposed
settlement is subject to court approval. Peterson also has consented to permanent industry bars based on the anticipated entry of the
injunctions against him and his criminal conviction.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of DOJ's Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New
York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Morgan Stanley, which is not charged in the matter, cooperated with the SECâs inquiry and
conducted a thorough internal investigation to determine the scope of the improper payments and other misconduct involved.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by David Neuman of the Asset Management Unit and Assistant Director Greg Faragasso, and the
litigation was led by Richard Hong.

SEC Announces Non-Prosecution Agreement With Raloh Lauren
Corporation Involving FCPA Misconduct

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-65

Washington, D.C., April 22, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with
Ralph Lauren Corporation in which the company will disgorge more than $700,000 in illicit profits and interest obtained in connection with
bribes paid by a subsidiary to government officials in Argentina from 2005 to 2009. The misconduct was uncovered in an internal review
undertaken by the company and promptly reported to the SEC.

The SEC has determined not to charge Ralph Lauren Corporation with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) due to the
company's prompt reporting of the violations on its own initiative, the completeness of the information it provided, and its extensive,
thorough, and real-time cooperation with the SEC's investigation. Ralph Lauren Corporation's cooperation saved the agency substantial time
and resources ordinarily consumed in investigations of comparable conduct.

The NPA is the first that the SEC has entered involving FCPA misconduct. NPAs are part of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cooperation
Initiative, which rewards cooperation in SEC investigations. In parallel criminal proceedings, the Justice Department entered into an NPA with
Ralph Lauren Corporation in which the company will pay an $882,000 penalty.

""When they found a problem, Ralph Lauren Corporation did the right thing by immediately reporting it to the SEC and providing exceptional
assistance in our investigation,"" said George S. Canellos, Acting Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The NPA in this matter makes
clear that we will confer substantial and tangible benefits on companies that respond appropriately to violations and cooperate fully with the
SEC.""

Kara Brockmeyer, the SEC's FCPA Unit Chief, added, ""This NPA shows the benefit of implementing an effective compliance program. Ralph
Lauren Corporation discovered this problem after it put in place an enhanced compliance program and began training its employees. That
level of self-policing along with its self-reporting and cooperation led to this resolution.""

According to the NPA, Ralph Lauren Corporation's cooperation included:

e Reporting preliminary findings of its internal investigation to the staff within two weeks of discovering the illegal payments and gifts.
e Voluntarily and expeditiously producing documents.
e Providing English language translations of documents to the staff.
e Summarizing witness interviews that the company's investigators conducted overseas.
e Making overseas witnesses available for staff interviews and bringing witnesses to the U.S.
According to the NPA, the bribes occurred during a period when Ralph Lauren Corporation lacked meaningful anti-corruption compliance and

control mechanisms over its Argentine subsidiary. The misconduct came to light as a result of the company adopting measures to improve its
worldwide internal controls and compliance efforts, including implementation of an FCPA compliance training program in Argentina.

As outlined in the NPA, Ralph Lauren Corporation's Argentine subsidiary paid bribes to government and customs officials to improperly secure
the importation of Ralph Lauren Corporation's products in Argentina. The purpose of the bribes, paid through its customs broker, was to
obtain entry of Ralph Lauren Corporation's products into the country without necessary paperwork, avoid inspection of prohibited products,
and avoid inspection by customs officials. The bribe payments and gifts to Argentine officials totaled $593,000 during a four-year period.

Under the NPA, Ralph Lauren Corporation agreed to pay $593,000 in disgorgement and $141,845.79 in prejudgment interest.

The SEC took into account the significant remedial measures undertaken by Ralph Lauren Corporation, including a comprehensive new
compliance program throughout its operations. Among Ralph Lauren Corporation's remedial measures have been new compliance training,
termination of employment and business arrangements with all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, and strengthening its internal controls
and its procedures for third party due diligence. Ralph Lauren Corporation also conducted a risk assessment of its major operations worldwide
to identify any other compliance problems. Ralph Lauren Corporation has ceased operations in Argentina.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kristin A. Snyder and FCPA Unit Assistant Director Tracy L. Davis in the San Francisco Regional
Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District
of New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the

Il.

FACTS

On the basis of this Order and the Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds! that:

Summary

1. From approximately September 1995 to November 2004, Total and others paid
approximately $60 million in unlawful payments to intermediaries for the purpose of inducing an
Iranian government official (the âIranian Officialâ) to use his influence to assist Total in
connection with obtaining contracts to develop the Sirri A and E oil fields and two phases of the
South Pars oil and gas field in Iran. Between 1995 and 2004 the Iranian Official was first the
head of one wholly owned subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company (âNIOCâââ) and later
the head of another NIOC wholly owned subsidiary. The Iranian Official was also a government
advisor to a high-ranking Iranian official. Total made these payments at the direction of the
Iranian Official to intermediaries through a consulting and services agreement and subsequent
amendments, entered into with an intermediary designated by the Iranian Official (âIntermediary
Oneâ).

2. During the relevant time period, Total and others violated the anti-bribery
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making payments at the direction of the
Iranian Official in connection with obtaining contracts. In addition, Total lacked sufficient
internal controls and, by mischaracterizing the payments as legitimate consulting fees, Total
violated the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.

Respondent

3. Total is a public company organized under the laws of the Republic of France and
headquartered in Nanterre, France. Total explores for and develops oil and gas resources around
the globe, and has American Depositary Shares that trade under the symbol TOT on the New
York Stock Exchange and are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act (15
U.S.C. Â§ 781(g)). Total is required to file reports with the Commission under Section 13 of the
Exchange Act, and is an âissuerâ within the meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1.

The Unlawful Payments
A. Sirri A and E

4. Total is an international oil and gas company involved primarily in the
exploration for, development, production, and sale of oil and natural gas from around the world.
Beginning in 1995, Total negotiated a development contract with NIOC to allow Total to
develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields.

 

! The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
5. NIOC was an agency and instrumentality of the Government of Iran and its
officers and employees were âforeign officials,â within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1)(A).

6. Prior to Totalâs executing the development contract with NIOC, in late May 1995
Total held a meeting with the Iranian Official and agreed to enter into a purported consulting
agreement with an intermediary designated by the Iranian Official. The payments that would be
made to an intermediary pursuant to the consulting agreement were for the purpose of inducing
the Iranian Official to use his influence to assist in obtaining NIOCâs signature to the Sirri A and
E development agreement.

7. During the course of its unlawful scheme, Total, acting through a senior executive
and others, corruptly made certain payments and took certain acts for the purpose of inducing the
Iranian Official to use his influence to assist Total, including the following payments and acts
concerning Sirri A and E.

8. On July 13, 1995, Total signed a contract with NIOC granting Total development
rights over the Sirri A and E oil fields (the âSirri AYE Development Agreementâ).

9. On July 10, 1995, three days prior to the announcement of the Sirri A/E
Development Agreement, Total International Ltd. (âTotal Internationalâ), a Bermuda-registered
subsidiary of Total, entered into a Consulting and Services Agreement (the âUmbrella
Agreementâ) with Intermediary One, acting at the direction of the Iranian Official. Total made
all payments under the Umbrella Agreement at the direction of the Iranian Official to his
designated intermediary. The Umbrella Agreement had no specific terms for payment, or other
consideration, but instead provided that the parties would, from time to time, enter into
Consulting Services Requests, which the parties understood would detail the amounts of the
unlawful payments that Total would pay at the direction of the Iranian Official. Moreover, and
despite the Umbrella Agreementâs reference to the provision of âeconomic and marketing
research and support servicesâ to Total by Intermediary One, Total International entered into the
Umbrella Agreement with Intermediary One as a mechanism for Total to pay at the direction of
the Iranian Official millions of dollars in unlawful payments to Intermediary One, for the
purpose of inducing the Iranian Official to use his influence in connection with NIOCâs entering
into the Sirri A/E Development Agreement.

10. Also on July 10, 1995, the parties entered into the first Consulting Services
Request (the âFirst Consulting Services Requestâ), providing for a series of payments from Total
to Intermediary One. That same day, Total International made a $500,000 payment from an
account held at a United States bank in New York City to an account at a Swiss bank. Over the
next two-and-a-half years, pursuant to the First Consulting Services Request, Total made an
additional five payments to intermediaries totaling approximately $16 million from accounts in
Switzerland to an account held at a Swiss bank, at the direction of the Iranian Official.
B. South Pars

11. During the course of its unlawful scheme, Total and others corruptly made certain
payments and took certain acts for the purpose of inducing the Iranian Official to use his
influence to assist Total, including the following payments and acts concerning South Pars:

12. In 1997, Total began negotiating with NIOC to develop phases 2 and 3 of the
South Pars gas field, a joint venture with a number of other multinational oil and gas companies.
As with the Sirri A and E transaction, Total agreed to make unlawful payments to an
intermediary designated by the Iranian Official for the purpose of inducing the Iranian Official to
use his influence in obtaining NIOCâs approval regarding South Pars.

13. On June 12, 1997, Total entered into a letter agreement (the âLetter Agreementâ)
with Intermediary One to amend the First Consulting Services Request to provide for an
accelerated payment of approximately $10 million from Total. In addition, on July 14, 1997,
Total International entered into a second Consulting Services Request (the âSecond Consulting
Services Requestâ). This agreement memorialized an approximately $10 million payment in
connection with the development of the Sirri A and E fields.

14. On July 13, 1997, Total International entered into an Assignment Agreement (the
âAssignment Agreement,â and together with the Umbrella Agreement, the First Consulting
Services Request, the Letter Agreement, and the Second Consulting Services Request, the
âConsulting Agreementsâ) with Intermediary One and a limited liability company established in
the British Virgin Islands (âIntermediary Twoâ). The Assignment agreement assigned
Intermediary Oneâs interests in the other Consulting Agreements to Intermediary Two.
Intermediary One was replaced with Intermediary Two.

15. On or about September 28, 1997, Total executed a contract with NIOC granting
Total a 40% interest in developing phases 2 and 3 of the South Pars gas field.

16. For a period of seven years, from September 1997 through November 2004, Total
made at least 12 payments exceeding $44 million to Intermediary Two for the purpose of
inducing the Iranian Official to use his influence in connection with Totalâs efforts to obtain and
retain business related to the South Pars project.

Cc. Totalâs Steps to Conceal the Payments

17. From the inception of Totalâs relationship with the Iranian Official Total
mischaracterized the expenses under the Consulting Agreements as âbusiness development
expensesâ when they were, in fact, unlawful payments for the purpose of inducing the Iranian
Official to use his influence in connection with granting rights to Total for the development of
the Sirri A and E and South Pars fields. Total improperly characterized the unlawful consulting
agreements as legitimate consulting agreements.

18. Total ceased making payments to the Iranian Officialâs designated intermediary in
approximately November 2004.
FCPA Violations

Exchange Act Section 30A Violations

 

19. Total violated the anti-bribery provisions of the federal securities laws contained
in the FCPA when it arranged for the payments to the Iranian Officialâs designated intermediary.
The payments were intended to, and did, induce the Iranian Official to use his influence to secure
the award to Total of development interests in Sirri A and E and the South Pars Project that,
combined, netted Total approximately $150 million in profits.

20. As aresult of the conduct described above, Total violated Section 30A of the
Exchange Act, which prohibits any issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section
12 of the Exchange Act, in order to obtain or retain business, from giving, or authorizing the
giving of, anything of value to any foreign official for purposes of influencing the official or
inducing the official to act in violation of his or her lawful duties, or to secure any improper
advantage; or to induce a foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government or
foreign governmental instrumentality to influence any act or decision of such government or
instrumentality.

Books and Records Violations

 

21. Total failed to properly account for the illegal payments and failed to accurately
describe the Consulting Agreements in its books and records. Instead, Total improperly
characterized the payments it made as legitimate payments for âbusiness development expenses,â
and improperly characterized the Consulting Agreements as ordinary consulting agreements.

22. As aresult of the conduct described above, Total violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and
accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and
disposition of their assets.

Internal Controls Violations

 

23. In entering into the Consulting Agreements, Total circumvented its own internal
controls. Total concealed the Consulting Agreementsâ true nature and participants. Total had
inadequate systems for reviewing these documents and lacked controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that the Consulting Agreements complied with applicable U.S. securities
laws.

24. As aresult of the conduct described above, Total violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of
the Exchange Act, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to
maintain accountability for assets; access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; and the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences.

IV.
UNDERTAKINGS
Respondent undertakes to:
1. To engage an independent compliance consultant that is a French national or

French law or accounting firm (the âCompliance Consultantâ) with demonstrated ability in
helping companies comply with the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1, et seg. and not unacceptable to
the staff of the Commission within 60 calendar days of the issuance of this Order. The
Compliance Consultant will, for a period of three years from the date of its engagement (the
âTerm of the Engagementâ), evaluate, in the manner set forth in this Order (unless any specific
provision therein is expressly determined by any French Authority identified by the Commission
(the âFrench Authorityâ) to violate French law), the effectiveness of Totalâs internal controls,
record-keeping, and financial reporting policies and procedures as they relate to Totalâs current
and ongoing compliance with the books and records, internal accounting controls and anti-
bribery provisions of the FCPA, codified in Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1, 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], Rule 13b2-1 thereunder
[17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1], and other applicable counterparts (collectively, the âanti-corruption
lawsâ) and take such reasonable steps as, in its view, may be necessary to fulfill the foregoing
mandate (the âMandateââ).

2. The Mandate shall include an assessment of Totalâs Board of Directorsâ and
senior managementâs commitment to an effective implementation of a corporate compliance
program against violations of the anti-corruption laws and its compliance code.

3. Total shall cooperate fully with the Compliance Consultant and the Compliance
Consultant shall have the authority to take such reasonable steps as, in its views, may be
necessary to be fully informed about Totalâs compliance program within the scope of the
Mandate, in accordance with the principles set forth herein and applicable law, including
applicable data protections and labor laws and regulations, such as, among others, Article 1 of
French Law No. 68-768 of July 26, 1968, as amended by Law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (the
âBlocking Statuteâ). To that end, Total shall: (1) facilitate the Compliance Consultantâs access
to Totalâs documents and other information and resources, (2) not limit such access, except as
provided in this paragraph, and (3) provide guidance on applicable local law (such as relevant
data protection and labor laws) to allow the Compliance Consultant to fulfill its Mandate. Total
shall provide the Compliance Consultant with access to all information, documents, records,
facilities, and/or employees, as reasonably requested by the Compliance Consultant, that fall
within the scope of the Mandate of the Compliance Consultant.

4. The Commission and Total agree that the retention of the Compliance Consultant
does not establish an attorney-client, auditor-client, or similar relationship between Total and the
Compliance Consultant which would otherwise prevent the Compliance Consultant from
fulfilling its Mandate in accordance with this Order.
5. In the event that Total seeks to withhold from the Compliance Consultant access
to information, documents, records, facilities, and/or employees of Total that may be subject to a
claim of attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or similar legal
relationships, or where Total reasonably believes production would otherwise be inconsistent
with applicable law, Total shall work cooperatively with the Compliance Consultant to resolve
the matter to the satisfaction of the Compliance Consultant. If the matter cannot be resolved, at
the request of the Compliance Consultant, Total shall promptly provide written notice to the
Compliance Consultant and to the French Authority. Such notice shall include a general
description of the nature of the information, documents, records, facilities, and/or employees that
are being withheld, as well as the basis for the claim. The French Authority may then transmit
this written notice in accordance with French law to the Commission. The Commission staff
may then consider whether to make a further request for access to such information, documents,
records, facilities, and/or employees, to be provided by Total to the French Authority. To the
extent Total has provided information to the Commission staff in the course of the investigation
leading to this action pursuant to a non-waiver of privilege agreement, Total and the Compliance
Consultant may agree to production of such information to the Compliance Consultant pursuant
to a similar non-waiver agreement.

6. Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5 herein, Total shall not withhold from
the Compliance Consultant any information, documents, records, facilities, and/or employees on
the basis of an attorney-client privilege, work-product claim, or other similar legal relationship.

7. To carry out the Mandate, during the Term of the Engagement, Total shall require
the Compliance Consultant to conduct a yearly review and prepare a yearly report for three
years, for a total of three reviews and three reports. The yearly reports will likely include
proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive business information. Moreover, public
disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation or impede pending or potential
government investigations. For these reasons, among others, the yearly reports and the contents
thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to by the
parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Commission determines in its sole discretion
that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commissionâs discharge of its duties and
responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.

8. With respect to each yearly review, after consultation with Total, Total shall
require the Compliance Consultant to prepare a written work plan that shall be submitted no
fewer than 60 calendar days prior to commencing each review to Total and to the Commission
unless, in the Compliance Consultantâs view, transmittal of such work plan would violate
applicable laws, in which case it shall be transmitted to Total and the French Authority. In such
case, the French Authority may then transmit such information in accordance with French law to
the Commission. Total and the Commission shall have no more than 30 calendar days after
receipt of the written work plan to provide comment to the Compliance Consultant about the
work plan. The Compliance Consultantâs work plan for the initial review shall include such
steps as are reasonably necessary to conduct an effective initial review in accordance with the
Mandate, including developing an understanding, to the extent the Compliance Consultant deems
appropriate, of the facts and circumstances surrounding any violations that may have occurred
before the entry of the Order, but in developing such understanding the Compliance Consultant
is to rely to the extent possible on available information and documents provided by Total. It is

7
not intended that the Compliance Consultant will conduct its own inquiry into those historical
events. In developing each work plan and in carrying out the reviews pursuant to such plans, the
Compliance Consultant is encouraged to coordinate with Total personnel, including auditors and
compliance personnel. To the extent the Compliance Consultant deems appropriate, it may rely
on Totalâs processes, on the results of studies, reviews, audits, and analyses conducted by or on
behalf of Total, and on sampling and testing methodologies. The Compliance Consultant is not
expected to conduct a comprehensive review of all business lines, all business activities, or all
markets. Any disputes between Total and the Compliance Consultant with respect to the work
plan shall be decided by the Commission staff in its sole discretion. The Compliance Consultant
will send each report to the French Authority, which may forward such information in
accordance with French law to the Commission.

9. The initial review shall commence no later than 120 calendar days from the date
of the engagement of the Compliance Consultant (unless otherwise agreed by Total, the
Compliance Consultant, and the Commission staff), and Total shall require the Compliance
Consultant to issue a written report within 120 calendar days of initiating the initial review,
setting forth the Compliance Consultantâs assessment and making recommendations reasonably
designed to improve the effectiveness of Totalâs program for ensuring compliance with the anti-
corruption laws. The Compliance Consultant is encouraged to consult with Total concerning its
findings and recommendations on an ongoing basis, and to consider and reflect Totalâs
comments and input to the extent the Compliance Consultant deems appropriate. The
Compliance Consultant need not in its initial or subsequent reports recite or describe
comprehensively Totalâs history or compliance policies, procedures, and practices, but rather
may focus on those areas with respect to which the Compliance Consultant wishes to make
recommendations for improvement or which the Compliance Consultant otherwise concludes
merit particular attention, if any. Total shall require the Compliance Consultant to provide the
report to the Managing Board of Total and contemporaneously transmit copies to the French
Authority. The French Authority may then transmit such information in accordance with French
law to the Commission. After consultation with Total, the Compliance Consultant may extend
the time period for issuance of the report for up to 60 calendar days with prior written approval
of the Commission staff.

10. Within 120 calendar days after receiving the Compliance Consultantâs report,
Total shall adopt all recommendations in the report unless within 60 calendar days after
receiving the report, Total notifies the Compliance Consultant and the Commission staff in
writing of any recommendations Total considers unduly burdensome, inconsistent with local or
other applicable law or regulation, impractical, unduly expensive, or otherwise inadvisable. It
shall not be deemed unduly burdensome if information otherwise protected by the Blocking
Statute, may be provided to the Commission in accordance with French law via the French
Authority or in some other manner. With respect to any recommendation Total considers unduly
burdensome, inconsistent with local or other applicable law or regulation, impractical, unduly
expensive, or otherwise inadvisable, Total need not adopt that recommendation within 120
calendar days after receiving the Compliance Consultantâs report, but shall propose in writing to
the Compliance Consultant an alternative policy, procedure, or system designed to achieve the
same objective or purpose. As to any recommendation on which Total and the Compliance
Consultant do not agree, the parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within 45
calendar days after Total serves written notice. In the event Total and the Compliance

8
Consultant are unable to agree on an acceptable alternative proposal, Total shall promptly
consult with the Commission staff, which will make a determination as to whether Total should
adopt the Compliance Consultantâs recommendation or an alternative proposal, and Total shall
abide by that determination. During the time period in which a Commission determination is
pending, Total shall not be required to implement any contested recommendation. With respect
to any recommendation the Compliance Consultant determines cannot reasonably be
implemented within 120 calendar days after receiving the report, the Compliance Consultant
may extend the time period for implementation with prior written approval of the Commission
staff.

11. Total shall require the Compliance Consultant to undertake two follow-up reviews
to carry out the Mandate. Within 120 calendar days of initiating each follow-up review, Total
shall require the Compliance Consultant to: (a) complete the review; (b) certify whether the
compliance program of Total, including its policies and procedures, is reasonably designed and
implemented to detect and prevent violations within Total of the anti-corruption laws; and (c)
report on the Compliance Consultantâs findings in the same fashion as set forth in Paragraph 8
with respect to the initial review. The second review shall commence one year after the initial
review commenced. The third review shall commence two years after the first review
commenced. After consultation with Total, the Compliance Consultant may extend the time
period for these follow-up reviews for up to 60 calendar days with prior written approval of the
Commission staff.

12. In undertaking the assessments and reviews in Paragraphs 7 and 11, Total shall
require the Compliance Consultant to formulate conclusions based on, among other things: (a)
inspection of relevant documents, including Totalâs current anti-corruption policies and
procedures; (b) on-site observation of selected systems and procedures of Total at sample sites,
including internal controls and record-keeping and internal audit procedures; (c) meetings with
and interviews of relevant employees, officers, directors, and other persons at mutually
convenient times and places; and (d) analyses, studies, and testing of Totalâs compliance
program with respect to anti-corruption laws.

13. Should the Compliance Consultant, during the course of its engagement, discover
that questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt transfers of property or interests
may have been offered, promised, paid, or authorized by any entity or person within Total, or
any entity or person working directly or indirectly for Total, or that related false books and
records may have been maintained relating to Total either (a) after the date of this Order or (b)
that have not been adequately dealt with by Total (collectively âimproper activitiesâ), Total shall
require the Compliance Consultant to promptly report such improper activities to Totalâs General
Counsel or Audit Committee for further action. If the Compliance Consultant believes that any
improper activity or activities may constitute a significant violation of law, Total shall require
the Compliance Consultant also to report such improper activity in writing to the French
Authority. The French Authority may then transmit such information in accordance with French
law to the Commission. Total shall require the Compliance Consultant to disclose improper
activities in its discretion directly to the French Authority, and not to the General Counsel or
Audit Committee, if the Compliance Consultant believes that disclosure to the General Counsel
or Audit Committee would be inappropriate under the circumstances. Total shall require the
Compliance Consultant to address in its reports the appropriateness of Totalâs response to all

9
improper activities. Further, in the event that Total or any entity or person working directly or
indirectly within Total refuses to provide information necessary for the Compliance Consultant
to perform its duties, if the Compliance Consultant believes that such refusal is without just
cause, Total shall require the Compliance Consultant to disclose that fact in writing to the French
Authority, with appropriate notice to the Commission. Total shall not take any action to retaliate
against the Compliance Consultant for any such disclosures. The Compliance Consultant may
report to the French Authority any criminal or regulatory violations by Total or any other entity
or person discovered in the course of performing its duties. The French Authority may then
transmit such information in accordance with French law to the Commission.

14. Total shall require the Compliance Consultant to enter into an agreement with
Total that provides that for the Term of the Compliance Consultancy and for a period of two
years from completion of the engagement, the Compliance Consultant shall not enter into any
employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Total, or
any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their
capacity. The agreement will also provide that the Compliance Consultant will require that any
firm with which it is affiliated or of which it is a member shall not, without prior written consent
of the Commission staff, enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing, or
other professional relationship with Total or any of its present or former affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such, and any person engaged to assist
the Compliance Consultant in the performance of its duties under this Order for the Term of the
Engagement and for a period of two years thereafter. To ensure the independence of the
Compliance Consultant, Total shall not have the authority to terminate the Compliance
Consultant during the Term of the Engagement without the prior written approval of the
Commission staff.

15. At least annually, and more frequently if appropriate, representatives from Total
and the Commission staff will meet to discuss the consultancy and any suggestions, comments,
or improvements Total may wish to discuss with or propose to the Commission staff.

16. Total will use its best efforts to ensure that any information that might be
protected by the Blocking Statute or by other laws that becomes the subject of the Compliance
Consultantâs reviews or reports is provided to the Commission in accordance with French law
via the French Authority or in some other appropriate manner.

17. Deadlines for procedural dates shall be counted in calendar days, except that if the
last day falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the next business day shall be considered to be the
last day.

18. Total shall certify, in writing, compliance with the undertakings set forth above.
The certification shall identify the undertakings, provide written evidence of compliance in the
form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The
Commission staff may make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and
Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and supporting material shall be
submitted to Andrew M. Calamari, Regional Director, New York Regional Office, with a copy to
the Office of Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60) days from the
date of the completion of the undertakings.

10
V.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the civil
remedies agreed to in Respondent Totalâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A.

Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Total shall cease and
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of
Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act;

SEC Charges Total S.A. for Illegal Payments to Iranian Official

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-94

Washington, D.C., May 29, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged France-based oil and gas company Total S.A.
with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying $60 million in bribes to intermediaries of an Iranian government official who
then exercised his influence to help the company obtain valuable contracts to develop significant oil and gas fields in Iran.

The SEC alleges that Total made more than $150 million in profits through the bribery scheme. Total attempted to cover up the true nature of
the illegal payments by entering into sham consulting agreements with intermediaries of the Iranian official and mischaracterizing the bribes
in its books and records as legitimate âbusiness development expensesâ related to the consulting agreements. Total had inadequate systems
to properly review the consulting agreements and lacked sufficient internal controls to comply with federal laws prohibiting bribery.

Total, whose securities are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, agreed to pay more than $398 million to settle the SECâs
charges and a parallel criminal matter announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âTotal used illicit payments to win business in Iran, and reaped substantial financial benefits as a result,â said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of
the SECâs New York Regional Office. âTotal must now pay back all of its profits from the companyâs corrupt conduct and additionally pay
criminal penalties on top of that.â

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Total negotiated a development contract in 1995 with the
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the countryâs Sirri A and E oil and gas fields. Prior to executing the contract, Total held a meeting
with the Iranian official and agreed to enter into a purported consulting agreement with an intermediary he designated. They agreed that
Total would make payments to the intermediary under the guise of a consulting agreement when the real purpose was to induce the Iranian
official to use his influence to help obtain NIOCâs approval of the development agreement. After the contract was executed, Total corruptly
made the bribery payments that resulted in NIOC allowing Total to develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields and make more than $150
million in profits.

The SECâs order requires Total to pay disgorgement of $153 million in illicit profits and retain an independent compliance consultant to review
and report on Totalâs compliance with the FCPA. Total also must cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 30A,
Section 13(b)(2)(A), and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In the parallel criminal proceedings, Total agreed to pay a $245.2 million penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Charges also
were recommended today by the prosecutor of Paris (Francois Molins, Procureur de la RÃ©publique) of the Tribunal de Grande Instance de
Paris for violations of French laws.

The SECâs investigation was led by Sharon Binger, Alex Janghorbani, and Barry OâConnell of the New York Regional Officeâs Enforcement
Division with significant assistance from the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit and the Department of Justiceâs Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section. The SEC also appreciates the assistance of French regulatory authorities.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ)

 

SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS

1, This matter concerns violations by Avon Products, Inc. (âAvonâ) of the corporate
recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.

2. Avon is a global provider of beauty products, primarily using a direct sales
method. Avonâs common stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§78/(b)].

5. From 2004 through the third quarter of 2008, Avonâs books and records failed to
accurately and fairly reflect payments by Avon Products (China) Co., Ltd. (âAvon Products
Chinaâ) to Chinese government officials.

4. Avon Products China provided cash and things of value, including gifts, travel,
and entertainment, to various Chinese government officials, including government officials
responsible for awarding a test license, and subsequently a direct sales business license, that

would allow a company to utilize direct door-to-door selling in China. Avon Products China
was, in fact, awarded a test license and, then, the first official direct selling business license in
China. Avon Products China also adopted an internal âno penalty policyâ and provided cash and
things of value to Chinese government officials to avoid fines and other penalties in order to
maintain an ostensibly pristine corporate image. Avon Products China also paid a third-party
consultant for purportedly legitimate interactions with government officials, even though Avon
Products China management knew the consultantâs invoices were often false and could not point
to legitimate services provided by the consultant. At times, payments were made to suppress
negative news in state-owned media and to obtain competitor information. In addition, Avon
Products China provided cash to government officials on behalf of other Avon subsidiaries in
China.

5. Avon Products China falsified its books and records so as to conceal the cash and
things of value provided to government officials.

6. Near the end of 2005, an Avon internal audit team reported potential issues
concerning things of value provided to Chinese government officials. Nevertheless, remedial
measures sufficient to address the issues were not implemented at Avon Products China. Similar
issues related to Avon Products China were raised at the end of 2006. Again, responsive
remedial measures were not implemented.

es The books and records at Avon Products China were consolidated into the books
and records of Avon. Avon thus violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act MS LA.

Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)] by failing to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and disposition of assets of the issuer.

8. By failing to ensure that it maintained adequate internal controls sufficient to

record the nature and purpose of payments, or to prevent improper payments, to government
officials, Avon failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances that its transactions and the disposition of its assets were
recorded correctly, accurately, and in accordance with authorization of management. Avon
thereby violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

9. Finally, in May 2008, Avon began a review of its compliance with the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), the U.S. legislation that, among other things, prohibits
payments to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. As a result of its review,
the company instituted extensive, related reforms.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].

11. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa].

DEFENDANT

12. Avon Products, Inc. is a New York corporation that has its headquarters in New
York City. The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty products. Avon
primarily sells its products through direct selling by over 6 million active independent sales
representatives. The company has wholly owned subsidiaries throughout the world with sales or
distribution of its products in over 100 countries located in North America, Latin America,
Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The financial results of Avonâs wholly owned
subsidiaries are ultimately consolidated into the financial statements of Avon. Throughout the
relevant period, Avonâs shares were registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act

[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78/(b)] and quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: AVP).
RELATED ENTITIES

Lay Avon Products (China) Co. Ltd. is headquartered in Guangzhou, China. Avon
Products China is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Avon. Avon controls two other Chinese
subsidiaries through Avon Products China: Avon Manufacturing (Guangzhou) Ltd. (âAvon
Manufacturing Chinaâ) and Avon Healthcare Products Manufacturing (Guangzhou) Limited
(âAvon Healthcare Chinaâââ).

STATEMENT OF FACTS

Avonâs Business Operations in China

14. Avon Products China began operations in the Peopleâs Republic of China in 1989
as part of a joint venture that manufactured its products and used a direct selling model.
However, in 1998 the Chinese government banned all direct selling. For a number of years,
Avon then marketed its products in independently owned retail operations called âBeauty
Boutiques.â When China subsequently expressed an interest in joining the World Trade
Organization (âWTOâ), the WTO requested that the Chinese government consider allowing
direct selling in the country as part of its admission into the organization. In 2001, the Chinese
government agreed to allow direct selling within three years. Avon wanted to influence the
legislation and regulations governing the reimplementation of direct selling in China. Avon also
wanted to be the first company to implement direct selling if, and when, the new regulations

became effective.

Avon Products Chinaâs Books and Records Attempt to Hide Payments to Government
Officials

15. In the years leading up to 2003, Avon Products China had expanded its
government relations department to liaise with the Ministry of Commerce (ââMOFCOMâ) and the

State Administration for Industry and Commerce (âAICâ), the government agencies responsible

4
for the implementation of direct selling regulation. In April 1999, an Avon Asia-Pacific
subsidiary hired an executive to, as stated in his employment agreement, âbring [ Avon] to the
attention of relevant organizations and help open doors and develop the required âGuanxiâ to
successfully conduct business.â (âGuanxiâ is a Chinese term that roughly translates as
âgoodwill.â) The executive was seconded to Avon Products China as its Vice President in
Corporate Affairs, the department with oversight and liaison responsibility for government
agencies on a national, provincial, and local level. Employees in the Corporate Affairs
department provided gifts, entertainment, and travel to government officials in these agencies for
the purpose of influencing the direct selling laws and to position Avon Products China as one of
the companies to be selected to test direct selling when the new regulations were implemented.

16. In October 2003, Avon was told informally that when China opened its markets to
direct selling, Avon Products China would be the first company to receive a test license. During
this period, Avon Products China continued to provide meals, travel, and entertainment to
MOFCOM and AIC officials. Avon Products China also sponsored cultural events, paid for
journalists to attend corporate announcements, and purchased the placement of positive news
stories--or the suppression of negative news stories--in government media, to maintain a positive
corporate image of the company.

LT. In April 2004, when the form of the direct selling regulations was being
negotiated within the Chinese government agencies, Avon continued to receive informal
communications that Avon Products China would be the first company allowed to test the new
regulations. After these communications, Avon Products China continued to provide travel,
meals, and entertainment and. began to meet more frequently with provincial and local

MOFCOM and AIC officials. . Avon Products China also retained the services of a third-party
consultant (âConsulting Company 1â) to manage public-relations-related affairs with the
government and external parties and to handle media matters in provinces and localities where
the subsidiary did not maintain an office. Avon Products China did not contractually bind
Consulting Company | to comply with the FCPA.

18. The Chinese government decided to issue one company a temporary license to
conduct direct sales to test the planned regulations. In April 2005, MOFCOM and AIC officially
approved Avon Products China as the first company to receive test approval to conduct direct
selling in Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangdong Province.

1D, In April 2005, based on interviews and preliminary procedures it had conducted
in China, Avonâs global internal audit flagged gifts to government officials and inadequacies in
related recordkeeping as an area of concern. Then, in a limited review conducted in May 2005,
Avonâs internal audit personnel observed that employees of Avon Products China had incurred
meals and entertainment expenses with government officials, but had failed to record the names
of the government officials or the business purpose of the expenses. As a result, Avonâs Vice
President, Internal Audit opened an internal compliance case and noted that a further review of
discretionary payments would be made in an upcoming limited scope internal audit.

20. During the spring and summer of 2005, Avonâs global internal audit department
considered the need to provide training on the provisions of the FCPA in the Asia-Pacific region,
including China. However, ultimately, Avon determined that its budget for that year would not
allow it to provide stand-alone FCPA training in the region.

21. In September 2005, an Avon internal audit team conducted field work for the
limited scope audit, including looking at discretionary payments at the Corporate Affairs

department in China. In late September, the team generated a draft report prominently noting
that it was a common business practice for Avon Products China to offer gifts and meals to
various government officials and that the majority of the government-related activities at Avon
Products China were not adequately documented. The draft report also noted that the gifts and
meals might be construed as the companyâs intent to expedite licenses from the government or to
avoid unfavorable rulings against the company, therefore potentially violating the provisions of
the FCPA. The day before the audit closing meeting, the senior management of Avon Products
China told the internal audit team that recording the name of the government official and the
purpose of the meeting would have a chilling effect with the officials. The internal audit team
and the senior management of Avon Products China brought the draft report to the attention of
the V.P. Internal Audit, who headed Avonâs global internal audit department. The V.P. Internal
Audit in turn brought the draft audit report and its language to the attention of Avonâs General
Counsel.

22. Avonâs Legal Department took the position that conclusions about potential
FCPA violations fell within the purview of Legal, and not Internal Audit. The V.P. Internal
Audit directed the internal audit team to have the FCPA conclusions removed from the draft,
pending further study of the issues. After the V.P. Internal Audit conferred with the Vice
President of Finance, Asia-Pacific, the internal audit team was directed to redraft the report,
recall and destroy all hard copies, and delete any e-mail to which the draft was attached.

aos Avonâs General Counsel discussed the issues raised in the report with Avonâs
Vice President, Legal & Government Affairs, and Avonâs Regional Counsel, Asia-Pacific. They
determined to follow-up on the information with the internal audit team and to consult outside
counsel. Avonâs V.P. Legal & Government Affairs contacted a major law firm to consult about

potential FCPA issues. In early November 2005, Avonâs General Counsel, V.P. Internal Audit,
V.P. Legal & Government Affairs, and V.P. Finance, Asia-Pacific, directed the internal audit
team to return to Avon Products China and to expand to the beginning of 2005 the timeframe of
their review of the expenses of the Corporate Affairs department. The internal audit team was
told not to create any electronic documents, not to send any e-mails regarding the follow-up
review, and not to use the term âFCPAâ in any written document.

24. The internal audit team completed the field work and created several handwritten
spreadsheets that confirmed the concerns the team had reported in their draft audit report.
Avonâs V.P. Finance, Asia-Pacific then hand-carried the spreadsheets on a flight from Hong
Kong to New York.

25, In mid-November 2005, after Avonâs V.P. Legal & Government Affairs received
the spreadsheets, he consulted the outside law firm and sent the spreadsheets to the firm. After
two subsequent telephone conferences with the law firm, Avonâs V.P. Legal & Government
Affairs, in mid-December 2005, sent the law firm a short e-mail stating that the company had
âmoved onâ from the issues and asking for an estimate of the fees incurred.

260. In December 2005, Chinaâs new direct selling regulations came into effect, lifting
the ban on direct selling and allowing companies to apply for licenses to conduct direct selling.
Under the direct selling regulations, a company was required to obtain a national direct selling
license and a direct selling license from each province and municipality in which it sought to
make direct sales. For a company to obtain a license, it was required to satisfy a number of
conditions, including having âa good business reputationâ and a record of no serious illegal
operations for the previous five years.

oye The direct selling regulations also banned the recruitment of certain types of

persons as direct sales staff, including persons under the age of 18, full-time students, foreigners,
teachers, medical personnel, civil servants, active service members of the armed forces, and any
person who was prohibited from taking any part-time job under applicable laws and regulations.

28. In late December 2005 and January 2006, Avonâs General Counsel, Avonâs V.P.
Legal & Government Affairs, and Avonâs Regional Counsel, Asia-Pacific decided to implement
certain remedial measures at Avon Products China, including the creation of a log listing the
government officials entertained or provided with gifts, and to require representations and
warranties in Avon Products Chinaâs contracts with third parties, including Consulting Company
1, that interacted with government officials and government agencies on behalf of Avon Products
China.

29. The ordered remedial measures did not require a description of the business
purpose of any meeting with government officials. Moreover, Avon Products China was
allowed to keep the log off-premises. In fact, none of the responsive measures were
implemented. Moreover, there was no instruction to the employees at Avon Products China to
otherwise change the practice of providing things of value to Chinese government officials.

30. In March 2006, the Chinese government did grant Avon Products China the first
national direct selling business license. (Avon competitors did not receive test or permanent
licenses until, or after, December 2006.) In the time between Avon Products Chinaâs receiving
the test direct selling license, in April 2005, and the time when it received the permanent direct
selling business license, the company provided over $100,000 in cash or things of value to
government officials.

31. Between March 2006 and July 2006, Avon Products China obtained all sought

provincial and municipal approvals to conduct direct selling.
32. After March 2006, Avon Products China continued providing things of value to
Chinese government officials at the national, provincial, and local levels to ensure that Avon had
a clean corporate image in China. Avon Products Chinaâs General Manager and its V.P. of
Corporate Affairs implemented a âzero penalty policy.â

33. Under the zero penalty policy, Avon Products China and Consulting Company 1
provided cash and things of value to Chinese government officials and government media to
reduce or eliminate potential fines against the company and to prevent negative news articles
from appearing in the media.

34. In December 2006, an Avon Products China executive informed an Avon Asia-
Pacific executive and Avonâs new head of internal audit by e-mail that Avon Products Chinaâs
Associate Director of Corporate Affairs had been terminated because he had submitted false
expense reports seeking reimbursement for gifts and entertainment provided to government
officials. Avonâs General Counsel was provided with a copy of the e-mail.

35. After consultation with ctu General Counsel, a new head of internal audit at Avon
asked two members of the audit team that had conducted the 2005 Avon Products China internal
audit to do follow-up work looking into expenses at the China Corporate Affairs group and to
confirm that the remedial measures had been implemented. Based on their review, the two
internal auditors aivined the new head of internal audit that they had concluded that problematic
payments and inadequate recordkeeping continued at Avon Products China and that the measures
had not been implemented. No remedial measures were implemented in response to the review.

36. In May 2008, the Avon Products China Corporate Affairs executive who had been
terminated wrote to Avonâs Chief Executive Officer alleging improper payments to Chinese

government officials over several years in the form of meals, entertainment, travel, sponsorship

10
of cultural events, gifts of art, and cash. The letter was forwarded to Avonâs Legal Department
and, in turn, to the audit committee of Avonâs foal of directors. The audit committee
commenced an internal investigation into the allegations and, in October 2008, Avon informed
the Commission and the Department of Justice.

37. Asa result of its internal investigation, Avon subsequently initiated substantial
remedial processes and procedures, on a global basis. Avon also instituted worldwide FCPA
training for all employees of the company.

Representative Categories of Improper Payments

38. From at least 2004 through the third quarter 2008, Avon Products China provided
cash and things of value to government officials, government entities, and state-owned media.
Avon Products Chinaâs books and records were created in a manner that would not allow a
reviewer to ascertain the specific government official or entity that received the payment or the
purpose for which the payment was made. In some instances, the documentation for the
payments contained almost no details.

39. Altogether, Avon Products China provided approximately $8 million dollars in
cash and things of value to Chinese government officials during the period from 2004 through
the third quarter 2008. The following are examples:

40. During the period, Avon Products China employees made approximately 9,600
payments totaling $1.65 million for meals and entertainment involving government officials.
The majority of these payments were for meals and entertainment expenses under $200 per
occurrence, without indication as to who attended the meal/entertainment or the business purpose
of the expense. One expense report submitted by a Corporate Affairs associate in May 2007
listed $8,100 for entertainment of government officials in a two-month period during the time

that Avon Products China was negotiating a certification of apparel for sale in China. Another

11
expense of $4,147 in April 2007 paid for a Pearl River cruise for 200 State and Regional AIC
officials during a conference of officials with responsibility for the oversight of Avon Products
Chinaâs direct selling business license. During the cruise, Avon Products China also placed free
products in each officialâs hotel room. In January 2008, an expense of $4,808 was incurred to
âaccompany government officialsâ in Guangdong Province during a period in which Avon
management met with the Governor of that Province.

41. | Avon Products China employees also provided gifts totaling $400,000, in addition
to at least $1.7 million worth of Avon products. Approximately $70,000 to 90,000 of that total is
attributable to tickets or corporate boxes at the China Open tennis tournament, given to AIC and
other government officials in 2004 and 2005 âto thank them for their support.â During these
years, Avon Products China was a corporate sponsor of the tournament and received the tickets
as part of that sponsorship. Avon Products China also provided government officials with gifts
that included Louis Vuitton merchandise, Gucci bags, and Tiffany pens.

42. During the period, Avon Products China employees provided approximately $1
million in payments for travel by government officials. Half of that amount was spent on the
following trips: (1) $93,000 for an eighteen-day, all-expenses-paid trip to the United States by
Guangdong Food and Drug Administration officials, in December 2005 and January 2006, that
included one half-day of visiting Avonâs research facilities in Suffern, NY; (2) $328,000 for
three-to-five days of travel by more than 200 AIC officials to visit Avon Products Chinaâs
Guangzhou property, with one half-day at that property and the remainder of the time spent
touring resort areas in southern China; (3) $23,000 for travel and expenses for government
journalists to attend the ceremony at which Avon Products China launched its direct selling test;

and (4) $22,000 for a trip by a provincial governor to Hong Kong without any Avon business

12
purpose. Avon Products China also sponsored trips of AIC officials to Europe during this
period. However, no records can be located that show the expenses for these trips.

43. Employees at Avon Products China also made payments totaling $1.5 million to
vendors and consultants, with knowledge that a significant portion of the funds would in turn be
paid to government officials. Of that amount, approximately $1.2 million was paid to Consulting
Company | to provide government relations and media crisis management. The payments to
Consulting Company 1 were often made in cash by Avon Products Chinaâs V.P. in Corporate
Affairs, who then would submit, or would have a subordinate submit, false expense reports for
reimbursement.

44. Employees of Avon Products China made a cash payment of approximately
$12,500 to an AIC official in Hunan Province to avoid a fine. The official told Avon Products
China that the AIC did not have a bank account and directed Avon Products China to wire the
funds to his personal bank account, structured in several deposits to avoid Chinese bank
reporting regulations.

45. | Avon Products Chinaâs employees also made payments to government officials
for conferences, and related meals, gifts, and entertainment, in 150 instances aggregating
$143,000. Records for these expenses do not indicate who attended the conferences, or the
business purpose of the expenses. Approximately $15,000 of this amount was for expenses
related to government journalistsâ attendance at an Avon Products China media event.

46. On occasion, an AIC official would request that Avon Products China sponsor an
activity in lieu of paying a fine related to the direct selling or Beauty Boutique business.
Similarly, rather than having a news story appear in the Economic Information Daily alleging

that Avon Products China had unlawfully recruited students to be sales promoters, Avon

13
Products China, at the behest of the publicationâs editor, paid $81,000 to sponsor an article
contest at that publication.

47. Employees at re Products China also made payments to state-owned media to
purchase advertising, in order to avoid negative news articles. During the relevant period, Avon
Products China made approximately 16 purchases of advertising totaling $41,000 to avoid
negative press.

48. Avon Products Chinaâs employees also paid for association fees, at the request of
Chinese government officials. These payments totaled approximately $5,000 and were often
made in cash.

49, During the relevant period, employees at Avon Products China also made
payments of approximately $740,000 that {eckedidecumentation sufficient to place the payments
in any of the exemplary categories set forth herein.

transactions and the disposition of its assets.

14
53. By reason of the foregoing, Avon violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].

SEC Charges Avon With FCPA Violations

Avon Entities to Pay $135 Million to Settle SEC and Criminal Cases

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-285

Washington D.C., Dec. 17, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global beauty products company Avon Products
Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by failing to put controls in place to detect and prevent payments and gifts to
Chinese government officials from employees and consultants at a subsidiary.

Avon entities agreed to pay a total of $135 million to settle the SECâs charges and a parallel case announced today by the U.S. Department of
Justice and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York.

The SEC alleges that Avon's subsidiary in China made $8 million worth of payments in cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment to gain access to
Chinese officials implementing and overseeing direct selling regulations in China. Avon sought to be among the first allowed to test the
regulations, and eventually received the first direct selling business license in China in March 2006. The improper payments also were made
to avoid fines or negative news articles that could have impacted Avonâs clean corporate image required to retain the license. Examples of
improper payments alleged in the SECâs complaint include paid travel for Chinese government officials within China or to the U.S. or Europe
as well as such gifts as Louis Vuitton merchandise, Gucci bags, Tiffany pens, and corporate box tickets to the China Open tennis tournament.

âAvon's subsidiary in China paid millions of dollars to government officials to obtain a direct selling license and gain an edge over their
competitors, and the company reaped substantial financial benefits as a result,â said Scott W. Friestad, an Associate Director in the SECâs
Division of Enforcement. âAvon missed an opportunity to correct potential FCPA problems at its subsidiary, resulting in years of additional
misconduct that could have been avoided.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the improper payments occurred from 2004
to 2008. Avon management learned about potential FCPA problems at the subsidiary through an internal audit report in late 2005. Avon
management consulted an outside law firm, directed that reforms be instituted at the subsidiary, and sent an internal audit team to follow
up. Ultimately, however, no such reforms were instituted at the Chinese subsidiary. Avon finally began a full-blown internal investigation in
2008 after its CEO received a letter from a whistleblower.

The SEC alleges that Avonâs books and records failed to accurately record the details and purpose of the payments. In some instances,
payments were concealed by falsely recording the transactions as employee business expenses or as reimbursement of a third-party vendor.
In other instances, the records for the payments set forth almost no detail at all. The resulting books and records did not allow a reviewer to
ascertain the government official or state-owned entities that received the payments or the purpose for which the payments were made.

The SECâs complaint charges Avon with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Avon agreed to
pay disgorgement of $52,850,000 in benefits resulting from the alleged misconduct plus prejudgment interest of $14,515,013.13 for a total of
more than $67.36 million. In the parallel criminal matter, Avon entities agreed to pay $67,648,000 in penalties. Avon also is required to
retain an independent compliance monitor to review its FCPA compliance program for a period of 18 months, followed by an 18-month period
of self-reporting on its compliance efforts. Avon would be permanently enjoined from violating the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the federal securities laws. In reaching the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the SEC considered Avonâs
cooperation and significant remedial measures.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Paul W. Sharratt and Roger Paszamant and supervised by David Frohlich. The SEC appreciates the
assistance of the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
Walid Hatoum EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I,

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Walid Hatoum (âHatoumâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to
Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-
and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (the âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. 78dd] by Respondent Walid Hatoum concerning offers of
payment and other benefits to foreign officials in Qatar in connection with the award of
government contracts to PBS&J International, Inc. (âPBSJ&J Intâlâ), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PBSJ Corporation (âPBSJâ).

Respondent

2. Walid Hatoum (âHatoumâ), age 55, is a United States citizen who initially
worked for PBSJ as an engineer from 1986 until 1990. In February 2009, Hatoum was rehired to
join PBS&J Intâl as its Director of International Marketing, even though his prior employment
file at PBSJ had been marked âIneligible for Rehire.â Although Hatoum did not formally join
PBS&J Intâ! until April 2009, he assisted PBS&/J Intâ! with identifying projects as early as
November 2008. Hatoum was promoted to President of PBS&J Intâ] in mid-June 2009, and
became an officer of PBSJ at the same time.

 

Relevant Entities

3. The PBSJ Corporation (âPBSJâ) was an employee-owned engineering and
construction firm incorporated in Florida and headquartered in Tampa. Through the relevant
period, PBSJâs common stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and PBSJ filed annual and quarterly reports as required
under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules thereunder.â

4. PBS&J International, Inc. (ââPBS&J Int'lâ) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PBSJ headquartered and incorporated in Florida. PBS&/J Intâ] was a provider of engineering,

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

On October 1, 2010, after the conduct at issue, WS Atkins ple (âAtkinsâ), a public limited engineering and

design company based in the United Kingdom and organized under the laws of England and Wales, acquired PBSJ
and all of its common stock. Atkins is traded on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol ATK.L. That day,
PBSJ filed a Form 15 with the Commission, which terminated all offerings of its securities and removed all
remaining securities from registration under Section 12(g). Post-acquisition, PBSJ became an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Atkins. On April 1, 2011, PBSJ changed its name to The Atkins North America Holdings
Corporation.

architectural and planning services in international markets, including the Middle East. PBS&J
Intâ! currently is a subsidiary of Atkins.

Facts

5. During 2009, PBS&J Intâ! won two multi-million dollar development contracts.
One contract was for work in Qatar and the other was for work in Morocco. Both were
competitively solicited and approved by the Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company
(âQatari Diarâ). Qatari Diar was established by the Qatari government to coordinate the
countryâs real estate development.

6. PBSJ and PBS&J Intâ1, through Hatoum, offered bribes to the then-Director of
International Projects at Qatari Diar (âForeign Officialâ), to secure Qatari government contracts
by planning to funnel funds to a local company the Foreign Official owned and controlled
(âLocal Partnerâ). Foreign Official, a former business colleague of Hatoumâs at another U.S.
engineering firm, worked for Qatari Diar throughout 2009, until his resignation from Qatari Diar
on December 21, 2009. Prior to joining PBSJ, Hatoum and Foreign Official discussed directing
business in the Middle East to Local Partner.

7. In return, Foreign Official provided PBS&J Intâ! with access to confidential
sealed-bid information and pricing information on the two government contracts that helped
PBS&J Intâ! tender bids that had a greater likelihood of being awarded, including a government
contract for which the Foreign Official was the project manager.

Offers and Promises Made to Foreign Official

LRT Project in Qatar

 

8. In November and December 2008, Hatoum began discussing potential
employment with PBSJ. Even before he received a formal employment contract, Hatoum met
with PBS&J Intâ] to discuss opportunities to grow PBS&J Intâ] business in the Middle East.
Hatoum discussed projects involving Qatari Diar, including a light rail transit project in Qatar
(âthe LRT Projectâ).

9. In January 2009, Hatoum arranged for Foreign Officialâs brother, through Local
Partner, to introduce PBS&J Intâ] to Qatari Diar senior executives involved in the LRT Project.
Soon after that meeting, PBS&J Intâ! decided to bid on the LRT Project. PBS&J Intâ! added
Foreign Officialâs company, Local Partner, on its proposal team as a subcontractor to handle
local operations such as hiring local labor, as well as complying with bonding and insurance
requirements. In return, Hatoum and PBS&J Intâ! agreed to pay the Foreign Official, through
Local Partner, 40% of profits realized from any LRT Project contract as well as reimburse its
direct costs. The remaining profits were to be split between PBS&/J Intâ! (40%) and another
U.S.-based subcontractor (20%), which would perform all of the planning and engineering
services for the LRT project.
10. Atthat time, Hatoum was the only person at PBS&J Intâ] who had any knowledge
about Foreign Officialâs ownership interest in Local Partner. Had PBSJ conducted meaningful
due diligence at that time, it would have discovered the Foreign Officialâs dual role as both
government official and third-party owner/operator of Local Partner.

11. During the bidding process, Foreign Official gave confidential sealed bid
information to PBS&/J Intâ! to assist it in winning the LRT Project in return for promised
payments. Foreign Official also made strategic and technical decisions on many aspects of the
LRT Project that favored PBS&/J Intâ] with Hatoumâs knowledge.

12. Foreign Official used a Local Partner alias to communicate that information to
Hatoum and other PBSJ and PBS&J Intâ! employees while disguising his involvement on
multiple conference calls and in dozens of emails to the United States. Hatoum was aware that
Foreign Official was using the alias in communications with PBSJ employees, officers, and
directors and with Qatari Diar. Hatoum flew to the Middle East to meet with Qatari Diar
officials, including Foreign Official, to discuss PBS&J Intâlâs qualifications for the LRT Project.
At the meeting, neither Foreign Official nor Hatoum informed Qatari Diar that Foreign Official
was working for Local Partner and providing confidential information and other assistance to
help PBS&J Intâ] win the contracts.

13. Following its initial submission, PBS&/J Intâ] revised its bid, based on information
and guidance provided by the Foreign Official, to best position itself to win the LRT Project and
to withstand possible challenges from competitors. On or about August 3, 2009, Qatar Diar
awarded the LRT Project contract worth approximately $35.6 million to PBS&J Intâl.

14. ~â After the award, PBS&/J Intâ! opened a joint account with Local Partner that was
accessible to Foreign Officialâs wife. PBS&J Intâ] also authorized a four-year letter of credit
relating to a bank guarantee in Qatar. The letter of credit was a precondition for receipt of the
first contract payment by Qatari Diar to PBS&/J Intâl, an upfront, 10% (approximately $3.6
million) payment, which was deposited into the joint account.

15. | Once the award was received, Hatoum offered Foreign Official an âagency feeâ to
Local Partner for 1.8% of the LRT Project contract amount (equivalent to approximately
$640,000). Additionally, PBS&J Intâl agreed to pay half of the salary of Foreign Officialâs wife,
who worked for Local Partner.

Design Contract in Morocco

 

16. In addition to the LRT Project, Qatari Diar opened a Morocco hotel resort
development (âMorocco Projectâ) for competitive bid. On August 7, 2009, PBS&J Intâ! emailed
its Statement of Qualifications for the design contract to Foreign Official, the Qatari Diar project
manager for the Morocco Project.

17. In October 2009, Hatoum offered payment to Foreign Official in the form of an
agency fee to Local Partner to secure the Morocco Project. The Morocco Project was worth

4
approximately $25 million to PBSJ Intâl, of which the Foreign Official was offered an agency fee
of 3% of the contract amount, which equates to approximately $750,000. Hatoum instructed a
PBS&J Intâl employee to hide the agency fee within the companyâs bid proposal by inflating
other components of the offer for the Morocco Project.

18. Foreign Official attended meetings with PBS&/J Intâ! employees to discuss the
project but neither Foreign Official nor Hatoum told employees that he was working for Local
Partner. At the same time, Foreign Official, using his Local Partner alias, reviewed and made
changes to PBS&J Intâlâs original bid offer via email and phone. He also made key technical and
strategic proposal decisions throughout the bidding process and instructed PBS&J Intâ] to lower
its offer to a specific dollar amount. By doing so, he ensured PBS&J Intâlâs final bid had a
greater likelihood of being approved by Qatari Diar. On or around October 19, 2009, Qatari Diar
informed PBS&J Intâ! that it was awarded the Morocco Project.

Red Flags

19. PBSJ and PBS&J Intâ! officers and employees ignored multiple red flags that
should have led them to uncover the payment scheme. For example, PBS&J Intâ] and PBSJ
employees knew that Local Partner was providing them with confidential sealed bid information.
Hatoum also informed the employees that he was obtaining information from someone that
Hatoum described as a âgood friendâ and âtop executiveâ at Qatari Diar. Before PBS&J Intâ!
submitted its bid for the Morocco Project, a PBS&J Intâ! officer learned that the husband of one
of the Local Partner employees was a government official working on the Morocco Project. The
PBS&J Intâ! officer learned of Foreign Officialâs role while attending dinner with Hatoum,
Foreign Official and the Foreign Officialâs wife. In addition, a PBSJ employee knew that
âagency feesâ to Local Partner were disguised as legitimate costs within the Morocco Project
bid.

Discovery of the Payment Scheme

 

20. Shortly after PBS&J Intâl was awarded the Morocco Project contract, PBSJâs
former Chief Operating Officer commented to PBSJâs then-general counsel that PBS&J Intâ! was
successful in winning two contracts in the Middle East within a fairly short period of time.
PBSJâs then-general counsel asked Hatoum how he was able to win the LRT and Morocco
Project contracts over companies with far more international experience. Hatoum told PBSJâs
then-general counsel PBSJ offered âagency feesâ in order to win the projects and, when asked,
admitted there âwould be a problemâ if the agency fees were not paid. PBSJâs then-general
counsel immediately launched an investigation of this issue.

21. Three weeks later, in November 2009, a Qatari government official informed
Hatoum and the then-President of PBSJ that Qatari Diar had discovered Foreign Officialâs
involvement in Local Partner and was rescinding PBS&J Intâlâs contract for the Morocco
Project. Hatoum then secretly made an offer of employment to a second Qatari foreign official
in return for influencing Qatari Diar to reinstate the contract. However, Qatari Diar refused to

5
reinstate the contract and did not provide PBS&J Intâ! any proceeds for the project. PBSJ
suspended Hatoum in December 2009. Hatoum also began deleting emails and other records.

22. PBS&J Intl and Qatari Diar negotiated a termination of the LRT Project contract
effective December 31, 2009. In January 2010, Qatari Diar entered into a bridge contract with
PBS&J Intâl to continue work on the LRT Project (the âBridge Contractâ) until a replacement
company could be found. Ultimately, the period of performance on the Bridge Contract was 16
Â¥% months. PBS&J Intâ] earned $2,892,504 in profits on the Bridge Contract. PBSJ and Qatari
Diar caught Hatoumâs scheme before any of the offered and authorized amounts were paid.

Hatoum Caused PBSJâs Inaccurate Books and Records

23. Hatoum authorized illicit payments to Foreign Official that were not accurately
and fairly reflected on PBSJâs books and records. Hatoum directed subordinates to conceal some
of the payments he offered and authorized to Foreign Official within bids. Other offers and
promises to pay authorized by Hatoum to Foreign Official were improperly described in the
books and records as legitimate transaction costs with his knowledge.

Hatoum Caused PBSJâs Internal Accounting Control Failure

24. On April 22, 2009, Hatoum signed a âBusiness Conduct Standardsâ agreement for
PBSJ employees in which he agreed that âI will neither accept nor give bribes or kickbacks of
any value for services or favorable treatment for contracts.â As a high level manager at PBS&J
Intâ! and later as an officer of PBSJ, Hatoum was responsible for maintaining and ensuring
compliance with PBSJâs internal accounting controls at PBS&J Intâ]. Hatoum, however,
repeatedly exploited the companyâs internal accounting control deficiencies to offer and
authorize payments to Foreign Official through Local Partner totaling approximately $1,390,000
to secure the LRT and Morocco Projects, plus 40% of any profits realized from the LRT Project
and partial salary to Foreign Officialâs wife. Hatoum instructed subordinates to inflate PBS&J
Intâ! bids by concealing payments to Local Partner intended for Foreign Official. Hatoum took
advantage of PBSJâs accounting controls system by introducing Local Partner as a âlegitimateâ
potential partner for the LRT Project and authorized a subordinate to execute an agreement to
pay Local Partner 40% of the LRT Project profits without subjecting Local Partner or its
employees to any meaningful due diligence. Hatoum also knowingly executed - and caused a
PBS&J Intâl employee to send a questionnaire requesting advocacy assistance from the United
States Department of Commerce that included false representations about Local Partner and
PBS&J Intl. Although Hatoum did not participate in PBSJâs FCPA training until after the
scheme was uncovered, Hatoum was aware of the prohibitions of the FCPA from annual FCPA
training that he received from his former employer.

Legal Standards and Violations

25. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any

6
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or
should have known would contribute to such violation.

FCPA Violations

26. As aresult of the conduct described above, Hatoum violated Section 30A of the
Exchange Act, which prohibits any issuer, officer, director, employee, or agent of such issuer or
any stockholder thereof acting on behalf of the issuer, to make use of the mails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to
pay, or authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or
authorization of the giving of anything of value to any foreign official or any person, while
knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given, or promised,
directly or indirectly, to any foreign official for the purposes of (1) influencing any act or
decision of such foreign official in his official capacity, (41) inducing such foreign official to do
or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official, or (ii) securing any
improper advantage in order to assist such issuer in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or
directing business to, any person.

27. As aresult of the conduct described above, Hatoum caused violations of Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by PBSJ, which requires reporting companies to make and keep
books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their
transactions and dispositions of their assets.

28. Lastly, as a result of the conduct described above, Hatoum caused violations of
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by PBSJ, and violated Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-
1 thereunder, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles; and prohibit persons from knowingly circumventing or knowingly failing
to implement a system of internal accounting controls, knowingly falsifying any book, record or
account, and directly or indirectly falsifying or causing to be falsified any book, record, or
account.

SEC Charges Former Executive at Tampa-Based Engineering
Firm With FCPA Violations

Company to Pay $3.4 Million in Deferred Prosecution Agreement

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2015-13

Washington D.C., Jan. 22, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former officer at a Tampa, Fla.-based
engineering and construction firm with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by offering and authorizing bribes and employment
to foreign officials to secure Qatari government contracts.

The SEC also announced a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with The PBS} Corporation that defers FCPA charges for a period of two
years and requires the company to comply with certain undertakings. PBS] must immediately pay $3.4 million in financial remedies as part of
the agreement, which reflects the companyâs significant cooperation with the SEC investigation. PBS] is now known as The Atkins North
America Holdings Corporation and no longer offers public stock in the U.S.

An SEC investigation found that Walid Hatoum, who has agreed to settle the SECâs charges, offered to funnel funds to a local company owned
and controlled by a foreign official in order to secure two multi-million Qatari government contracts for PBS] in 2009. The foreign official
subsequently provided Hatoum and PBS|âs international subsidiary with access to confidential sealed-bid and pricing information that enabled
the PBS] subsidiary to tender winning bids for a hotel resort development project in Morocco and a light rail transit project in Qatar.

âHatoum offered and authorized nearly $1.4 million in bribes disguised as âagency feesâ intended for a foreign official who used an alias to
communicate confidential information that assisted PBS],â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âPBS}
ignored multiple red flags that should have enabled other officers and employees to uncover the bribery scheme at an earlier stage. But
once discovered, the company self-reported the potential FCPA violations and cooperated substantially.â

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Hatoum, he also offered employment to a second foreign
official in return for assistance as the bribery scheme began to unravel and PBS] lost the hotel resort contract. Even though the bribes
themselves were not consummated before the scheme was uncovered by the company, PBS] earned approximately $2.9 million in illicit
profits because it continued work on the light rail project until a replacement company could be found.

Under the DPA, PBS] agreed to pay disgorgement and interest of $3,032,875 and a penalty of $375,000. PBSJ took quick steps to end the
misconduct after self-reporting to the SEC, and the company voluntarily made witnesses available for interviews and provided factual
chronologies, timelines, internal summaries, and full forensic images to cooperate with the SECâs investigation.

The SECâs order against Hatoum finds that he violated the anti-bribery, internal accounting controls, books and records, and false records
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Hatoum agreed to pay a penalty of $50,000.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by FCPA Unit members Tracy L. Price and Jim Valentino. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the
Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In the Matter of ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT
MEAD JOHNSON NUTRITION TO SECTION 21C OF THE
COMPANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, MAKING FINDINGS AND
Respondent. IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST
ORDER
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Mead Johnson Nutrition Company
(âMead Johnsonâ or âRespondentâ.

II.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist
Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.

Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
1. This matter concerns violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâââ) by Mead Johnson. The violations,
which occurred in connection with the operations of Mead Johnsonâs subsidiary in China, took
place up through 2013.

2. The conduct at issue relates primarily to the misuse of marketing and sales funds in
China. Despite prohibitions in the FCPA and Mead Johnsonâs internal policies, certain employees
of Mead Johnsonâs majority-owned subsidiary in China, Mead Johnson Nutrition (China) Co., Ltd.
(âMead Johnson Chinaâ), made improper payments to certain health care professionals (âHCPsââ)
at state-owned hospitals in China to recommend Mead Johnsonâs nutrition products to, and provide
information about, expectant and new mothers. These payments were made to assist Mead
Johnson China in developing its business. For the period from 2008 through 2013, Mead Johnson
China paid approximately $2,070,000 to HCPs in improper payments and derived profits therefrom
of approximately $7,770,000.

3. Mead Johnson China failed to accurately reflect the improper payments in its books
and records. Mead Johnson Chinaâs books and records were consolidated into Mead Johnsonâs
books and records, thereby causing Mead Johnsonâs consolidated books and records to be
inaccurate. Mead Johnson failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting
controls over Mead Johnson Chinaâs operations sufficient to prevent and detect the improper
payments that occurred over a period of years.

Respondent

4. Mead Johnson is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Glenview, Illinois. The
companyâs common stock has been registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of
the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE since February 11, 2009. The company is a global
manufacturer and marketer of infant formula and child nutrition products. Mead Johnson has
subsidiaries throughout the world, including Mead Johnson China, and the financial results of its
subsidiaries are consolidated into the financial statements of Mead Johnson. Mead Johnsonâs total
revenues for 2013 were $4.2 billion.

Facts

5. Mead Johnson has established internal policies to comport with the FCPA and local
laws, and to prevent related illegal and unethical conduct. Mead Johnsonâs internal policies
include prohibitions against providing improper payments and gifts to HCPs that would influence
their recommendation of Mead Johnsonâs products.

6. Mead Johnson began doing business in China in the 1990s, and in 1995 constructed
a manufacturing plant in Guangzhou, China. From 2008 through 2013, Mead Johnson Chinaâs
geographic presence grew from 28 to 241 cities in China.

Mead Johnson Chinaâs Improper Payments to HCPs
2
7. A portion of Mead Johnson Chinaâs marketing efforts during the 2008 to 2013
period was through the medical sector, which included marketing through healthcare facilities and
HCPs. Despite the prohibitions in the FCPA and Mead Johnsonâs internal policies, certain
employees of Mead Johnson China improperly compensated HCPs, who were foreign officials
under the FCPA, to recommend Mead Johnsonâs infant formula to, and to improperly provide
contact information for, expectant and new mothers.

8. Funding for those payments came from funds generated by discounts provided to
Mead Johnson Chinaâs network of distributors.

9. Mead Johnson China uses third-party distributors to market, sell and distribute
product in China. Some of Mead Johnson Chinaâs funding of its marketing and sales practices
were effected through discounts provided to the distributors. Pursuant to contracts between Mead
Johnson China and its distributors, Mead Johnson China provided the distributors a discount for
Mead Johnsonâs products that was allocated for, among other purposes, funding certain marketing
and sales efforts of Mead Johnson China. This form of funding was referred to as âDistributor
Allowance.â

10. Although the Distributor Allowance contractually belonged to the distributors,
certain members of Mead Johnson Chinaâs workforce exercised some control over how the money
was spent, and certain Mead Johnson China employees provided specific guidance to distributors
concerning the use of the funds. Mead Johnson China staff also maintained certain records related
to Distributor Allowance expenditure by distributors. In addition, Mead Johnson China used some
of the funds to reimburse Mead Johnson Chinaâs sales personnel for a portion of their marketing
and other expenditures on behalf of Mead Johnson China.

11. Mead Johnson Chinaâs sales personnel marketed product through medical channels,
including healthcare facilities. These sales personnel encouraged HCPs at the healthcare facilities
to recommend Mead Johnson products to mothers and to collect contact information of the mothers
for Mead Johnson Chinaâs marketing purposes. To incentivize HCPs to recommend Mead
Johnson product and collect information from the mothers, these sales personnel improperly paid
HCPs, providing cash and other incentives, contrary to Mead Johnsonâs internal policies. The
Distributor Allowance was the funding source for the cash and other incentives paid to HCPs.

Mead Johnson Failed to Make and Keep Accurate Books and Records and Devise
and Maintain an Adequate Internal Control System

12. The Distributor Allowance funds contractually belonged to the distributors, but
were in large part under Mead Johnson Chinaâs control. Mead Johnson Chinaâs employees
maintained certain records related to the Distributor Allowance, including records reflecting
payments to HCPs. However, those records were incomplete and did not reflect that a portion of
Distributor Allowance was being used contrary to Mead Johnsonâs policies.

13. Mead Johnson failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal controls
over the operations of Mead Johnson China to ensure that Mead Johnson Chinaâs method of
3
funding marketing and sales expenditures through its distributors was not used for unauthorized
purposes, such as the improper compensation of HCPs. The use of the Distributor Allowance to
improperly compensate HCPs was contrary to managementâs authorization and Mead Johnsonâs
internal policies. Mead Johnson failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that Mead Johnson Chinaâs funding of
marketing and sales expenditures through third-party distributors was done in accordance with
managementâs authorization.

Internal Investigation and Remedial Efforts

14. In 2011, Mead Johnson received an allegation of possible violations of the FCPA in
connection with the Distributor Allowance in China. In response, Mead Johnson conducted an
internal investigation, but failed to find evidence that Distributor Allowance funds were being used
to make improper payments to HCPs. Thereafter, Mead Johnson China discontinued Distributor
Allowance funding to reduce the likelihood of improper payments to HCPs, and discontinued all
practices related to compensating HCPs by 2013. Mead Johnson did not initially self-report the
2011 allegation of potential FCPA violations and did not thereafter promptly disclose the existence
of this allegation in response to the Commissionâs inquiry into this matter.

15. As a result of its second internal investigation commenced in 2013, Mead Johnson
undertook significant remedial measures including: termination of senior staff at Mead Johnson
China; updating and enhancing financial accounting controls; significantly revising its compliance
program; enhancing Mead Johnsonâs compliance division, adding positions including a second
senior-level position; establishing new business conduct controls and third party due-diligence
procedures and contracts; establishing a unit in China that monitors compliance and controls in
China on an on-going basis; and providing employees with a method to have immediate access the
companyâs policies and requirements.

16. Despite not self-reporting the 2011 allegation of potential FCPA violations or
promptly disclosing the existence of this allegation in response to the Commissionâs inquiry into
this matter, Mead Johnson subsequently provided extensive and thorough cooperation. Mead
Johnson voluntarily provided reports of its investigative findings; shared its analysis of documents
and summaries of witness interviews; and responded to the Commissionâs requests for documents
and information and provided translations of key documents. These actions assisted the
Commission staff in efficiently collecting valuable evidence, including information that may not
have been otherwise available to the staff.

Legal Standards and Violations

17. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was, or would
be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such a violation.
18. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires every issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and keep books, records,
and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.

19. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires such issuers to, among other
things, devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that the transactions are (i) executed in accordance with managementâs
general or specific authorization; (11) recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (âGAAPâ) or any other
applicable criteria; and (111) recorded as necessary to maintain accountability for assets.

20. Up through 2013, certain Mead Johnson China employees made payments to HCPs
using funds maintained by third parties. These funds and payments from the funds were not
accurately reflected on Mead Johnson Chinaâs books and records. The books and records of Mead
Johnson China were consolidated into Mead Johnsonâs books and records. As a result of the
misconduct of Mead Johnson China, Mead Johnson failed to make and keep books, records, and
accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected its transactions as required by
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.

21. Up through 2013, Mead Johnson failed to devise and maintain an adequate system
of internal accounting controls to ensure that Mead Johnson Chinaâs method of funding marketing
and sales expenditures through third-party distributors was not used for unauthorized purposes,
such as improperly compensating Chinese HCPs to recommend Mead Johnsonâs products. As a
result of such failure, the improper payments to HCPs occurred contrary to managementâs
authorizations, in violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

IV.

On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the
sanctions agreed to in the Respondentâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Mead Johnson cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A)
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act;

B. Pursuant to Section 21(B)(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, Mead Johnson shall, within
ten (10) days of entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of $7,770,000, prejudgment interest of
$1,260,000, and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $3,000,000 for a total payment of
$12,030,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If timely payment is not made,
additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and 31 U.S.C. Â§ 3717.
Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

5
(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission,
which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

SEC Charges Mead Johnson Nutrition With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2015-154

Washington D.C., July 28, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Mead Johnson Nutrition Company has
agreed to settle charges that its Chinese subsidiary made improper payments to health care professionals at government-owned hospitals to
recommend the companyâs infant formula to patients who were new or expectant mothers.

Mead Johnson Nutrition agreed to pay $12 million to settle the SECâs finding that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

An SEC investigation found that employees funded the improper payments through âdistributor allowanceâ funds paid to third-party
distributors who market, sell, and distribute the companyâs products in China. Although the funds contractually belonged to the distributors,
employees exercised some control over how the money was spent and provided specific guidance to distributors on how to use the funds.
Cash and other incentives were subsequently paid to health care professionals in China hospitals to recommend Mead Johnson Nutrition
products and provide the company with contact information for patients who were new or expectant mothers so it could market its infant
formula to them directly. The company did not accurately reflect in its books and records the more than $2 million in improper payments
made during a five-year period.

âMead Johnson Nutritionâs lax internal control environment enabled its subsidiary to use off-the-books slush funds to pay doctors and other
health care professionals in China to recommend its baby formula and give the company marketing access to mothers,â said Kara
Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

The SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding finds that Mead Johnson Nutrition violated the books and records and internal
control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings
and agreed to pay $7.77 million in disgorgement, $1.26 million in prejudgment interest, and a $3 million penalty.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by William B. McKean of the Salt Lake Regional Office.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS, PURSUANT
TO SECTION 21C OF THE

VICENTE E. GARCIA, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
Respondent. IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST
ORDER

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) against Vicente E. Garcia (âGarciaâ or
Respondentâ).

II.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (the âOrderâ),
as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ) by Vicente E. Garcia
(âGarciaâ), a U.S. citizen and the head of Latin American sales for SAP SE (âSAPâ), a European
Union corporation headquartered in Waldorf, Germany. SAP provides technology solutions and
services in approximately 188 countries and has more than 68,000 employees. Garcia and others
offered to pay bribes to two government officials, and paid bribes of at least $145,000 to another
senior government official of the Republic of Panama in order to secure software license sales of
approximately $3.7 million to various government agencies; the sales were recorded initially in
the books and records of SAP Mexico and subsequently consolidated into the financial
statements of SAP. Garcia circumvented SAPâs internal controls by falsely justifying the
discount amount offered to its local partner. In doing so Garcia helped to facilitate the local
partnerâs ability to generate excess earnings on the final, end-user sale, which earnings were then
used to create a slush fund to finance the bribes paid to government officials.

Respondent

2. Vicente E. Garcia (age 65), a U.S. citizen residing in Miami, Florida, was the
Vice-President of Global and Strategic Accounts, responsible for sales in Latin America for SAP
from February 2008 until April 2014.

Related Entities

3. SAP SE (âSAPâ) is a European Union corporation headquartered in Waldorf,
Germany, that provides technology solutions and services in over 180 countries. SAPâs
American Depository Shares are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the
Securities Act of 1933, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

4. SAP International, Inc. (ââSAPIâ), a Miami, Florida-based wholly-owned
subsidiary of SAP, is engaged in selling software in the North and Latin American and
Caribbean markets. SAPI does not enter into direct or indirect software or software-related
services deals with end customers. Instead, SAPI employs some of the members of the Latin
America and Caribbean (âLACâ) regional leadership team and provides some back office
operational support for some of the LAC regional subsidiaries. Garcia was on the payroll of
SAPI, but he reported to managers of both SAPI and SAPâs Brazilian subsidiary, and his
reporting chain ultimately went up to SAP in Germany.

 

5. SAP Mexico S.A. de C.V. (âSAP Mexicoâ) is a Mexico City, Mexico-based
wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP engaged in selling software in the Mexican and Central
American markets. SAP Mexico is authorized by SAP to distribute, sell, license, and sublicense
software directly and indirectly to end customers. SAP Mexico is also authorized to provide
customers with software-related services such as implementation, maintenance, training, and
consulting. Garcia negotiated the Panamanian contracts on behalf of SAP Mexico. SAP
Mexicoâs financial statements are consolidated and reported in SAPâs financial statements.

 
Facts

6. From at least June 2009 through November 2013, Garcia, along with others,
planned and executed a scheme to offer and pay bribes to three senior government officials of the
Republic of Panama in order to obtain approximately $3.7 million worth of software sales by
SAP to the Panamanian government. Garcia, in concert with others, paid bribes to one
Panamanian government official in the amount of $145,000, and promised to pay bribes to two
other government officials, all in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the
âFCPAâ).

7. Garcia was SAPâs Vice-President of Global and Strategic Accounts, responsible
for sales in Latin America from February 2008 until April 2014, when SAP requested that he
resign for his misconduct discussed herein. Garcia was employed by SAPI and worked on large
deals all over Latin America using resources and personnel from other SAP subsidiaries
including SAP Mexico.

8. SAP, through its 272 subsidiaries, sells software licenses and related services to
263,000 customers in 188 countries. SAPâs global business is directed and operated from its
headquarters in Waldorf, Germany and executed through its numerous subsidiaries.
Approximately 15% of SAPâs sales are directly to the customer. The remainder of SAPâs
business is conducted through a network of more than 11,500 partners worldwide that provide an
additional workforce of 380,000 individuals skilled in SAP software solutions and technology.
SAPâs sales using a partner can be either (1) a direct sale to a customer with a sales commission
paid to a partner that provides assistance, (11) an indirect sale through a partner that purchases the
software license and resells it to a customer at an independently determined increased price, or
(111) a direct sale to the partner, which acts as a distributor and independently resells the software
licenses to customers in the future.

9. In June 2009, Garciaâs business associate, a Panamanian lobbyist (the
âLobbyistâ), informed Garcia about potential software sales opportunities with the government
of Panama and that he had an existing relationship with the newly elected government, including
a high ranking Government Official A, who was tasked with improving technology solutions
across multiple government agencies in Panama and had significant influence over Panamaâs
software purchasing decisions. Thereafter, SAP began investigating possible software sales to
the Panamanian government. Initially this endeavor was led by local SAP sales employees in
Mexico. Garcia, however, took over the business opportunity by recommending that SAP
designate the Panama government as part of the Premier Customer Network â a group of large,
strategically important, regional customers â which Garcia headed.

10. On February 9, 2010, Government Official A asked in an e-mail whether SAP
could send him a letter inviting him to Mexico for âsome fictional meetings in order to justify a
trip there on Monday and Tuesday of Carnival.â The same day, Garcia acceded to the request
and sent an e-mail to Government Official A with an attached fictitious letter on SAP letterhead
inviting him âto Mexico City so that you can directly and personally evaluate the benefits that
the Government of Mexico has obtained by adopting our products and services.â The letter also
included a fictitious itinerary of proposed meetings that never occurred. The next day, on
February 10, Garcia sent an e-mail from his personal Yahoo! e-mail account inquiring about
possible business opportunities from Government Official A stating: âAny news... ? Was the
document OK for him? Can you ask him to finalize a deal for us in Feb-March, I need between
$5 and $10 million.â

11. In late February 2010, Garcia and another SAP employee traveled from Miami,
Florida to Panama and met with Government Official A and others to discuss business
opportunities. Thereafter, in April 2010, Garcia began preparing a proposal to sell
approximately $29 million worth of software licenses to the Panamanian social security agency,
anticipating that this sale would be the first of multiple deals with various ministries and
agencies of the Panamanian government totaling over $100 million. Ultimately, some of these
additional sales never materialized and others were smaller than expected.

12. Garcia and others were informed by the Lobbyist that in order to obtain these
contracts from the government of Panama, they needed to bribe three Panamanian government
officials that had significant influence in the Panamanian governmentâs award of contracts to
purchase software.

13. In anticipation of the sales to the government of Panama, Garcia and others began
planning the details of the bribery scheme. On June 9 and 10, 2010, Garcia discussed with
others, including via e-mail, their plans to pay bribes to Government Official A (2% of the value
of the contract) and Government Official B (10%), and receive kickbacks for themselves (2%).
Also, on October 26, 2010, e-mails were exchanged with two attached spreadsheets referencing
planned payments to Government Officials A and C of approximately $100,000 and $300,000,
respectively.

14. To facilitate payments to Government Official B, the Lobbyist proposed using a
sham contract for fictitious services to be provided by Government Official Bâs brother-in-lawâs
company. On June 17, 2010, Government Official A received two draft sham contracts with the
stated purpose of having these two back-to-back contracts so that âno trace remains if SAP
conducts an audit... . I made it as simple as possible and made it look like a real contract.â On
June 18, 2010, the Lobbyist e-mailed Garcia an unsigned corrected copy of the proposed
consulting agreement, which provided that Government Official Bâs brother-in-lawâs company
would receive â10% (ten percent) for performance of its Services and Consulting dutiesâ relating
to all âbusiness opportunitiesâ with the Panamanian government.

15. On October 19, 2011, the Lobbyist e-mailed a spreadsheet to Government Official
C indicating that they would share $274,000 in 2011 and $226,000 in 2012. On January 9, 2013,
another business associate of Garcia e-mailed Government Official A stating that Garcia and his
business associate had agreed to give Government Official A some of their kickback so that
Government Official A could receive a larger âcommissionâ of $150,000. In addition, the
business associate confirmed that Government Official A already had been paid $45,000 and
acknowledged that $105,000 was still outstanding.
16. As aresult of Garciaâs conduct in the bribery scheme, SAP, with its local partner,
was able to sell software to the Panamanian government through four contracts from 2010 to
2013. These contracts generated revenues of $3.7 million to SAP.

17. One of the four contracts was a software license sale to the Panamanian social
security agency, which was initially proposed to be a direct sale with the assistance of local
partners. In order to facilitate the bribery scheme, the existing partners were replaced with a new
local Panamanian partner. Because SAP refused to pay additional commission to this new
Panamanian company, Garcia and others began looking for other ways to advance the bribery
scheme. Finally, in the fall of 2010, Garcia finalized an indirect sale of the software license to
the agency through the local partner, which, with Garciaâs assistance, ultimately sought and
obtained an 82% discount on the sale price. Garcia caused various approval forms to be
submitted that misstated the reasons for the large discount. Garcia stated that the discounts were
necessary to compete with other software companies in establishing a relationship with the
government of Panama when, in fact, the discounts were necessary to pay bribes to government
officials. Garcia and others planned to sell SAP software to the intermediary at an 82% discount,
who in turn would sell them at significantly higher prices to the Panamanian government and use
part of the profits from the sale to pay bribes.

18. SAP agreed to sell the software licenses for the Panamanian social security
agency to the local partner for approximately $2.1 million. In November 2010, the local partner
successfully bid $14.5 million for the contract, which was awarded by the Panamanian
government on January 31, 2011. Garcia, along with others, planned to pay bribes to
Panamanian government officials from the proceeds of the software sale to the government of
Panama.

19. Thereafter, as noted above, between June 2012 and December 2013, the
Panamanian government awarded three additional contracts that included SAP software products
valued at approximately $13.5 million, which were also sold at deep discounts by SAP to its
local partner. For these contracts also, Garcia and others agreed to pay bribes to Panamanian
officials from the proceeds of the software sales.

20. Between April 11, 2012 and August 13, 2013, Garcia and his business associate
paid at least $145,000 in bribes to Government Official A. Between December 27, 2011 and
October 29, 2012, another Garcia business associate paid Garcia a kickback of approximately
$85,965 in his bank account in Florida from the proceeds of the sale of SAP software licenses to
the Panamanian government. Thus, Garcia, with the assistance of others, bribed one government
official and promised to pay bribes to two other government officials to obtain contracts to sell
software to Panamanian government, all in violation of the FCPA.

Legal Standards and Violations

21. Section 30A(a) of the Exchange Act sets forth the anti-bribery provisions of the
FCPA. It prohibits an issuer any officer, director, employee or agent of such issuer or any
stockholder thereof acting on behalf of such issuer from using the âmails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to
pay, or authorization of the paymentâ of money to any person, while knowing that all or a

5
portion of such money âwill be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to any foreign
official ... for purposes ofâ, among other things, âinducing such foreign official ... in order to
assist such issuer in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any
person.â

22. By engaging in the conduct described above, Garcia, as an agent of SAP, violated
Section 30A in connection with the sale of software licenses and other related services to the
government of Panama. On behalf of SAP, Garcia participated in structuring the deal as an
indirect sale through the local partner, with the understanding that it would act as a conduit to
send corrupt payments to several government officials. Garcia, along with others, promised to
make bribe payments to two senior government officials and made bribe payments to another
government official, all in violation of the FCPA. Garcia used the mails and other means and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce to bribe government officials. Garcia used his SAP e-
mail account and his personal Yahoo! e-mail account to plan and execute the bribery scheme. In
addition, as part of the bribery scheme, Garcia flew from Miami to Panama to meet with
government officials and others, and Garcia received $85,965 in âkickbacksâ into his bank
account in Florida.

23. Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act provides that no person shall knowingly
circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or
knowingly falsify any book, record or account of an issuer described in Section 13(b)(2) of the
Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 prohibits any person from, directly or indirectly,
falsifying or causing to be falsified any book, record, or account subject to Exchange Act Section
13(b)(2)(A). Scienter is not an element of a Rule 13b2-1 violation. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.2d 732, 740-41 (2""* Cir. 1998).

24. Garcia knowingly falsified SAP Mexicoâs books and records by engaging in a
scheme to create a slush fund at the local partner, which was used to pay bribes to Panamanian
government officials. Garcia also knowingly circumvented the companyâs internal controls to
change the sale of the software licenses from a direct sale to the government of Panama to an
indirect sale through intermediaries at deep discounts in order to facilitate payments to
government officials. Specifically, Garcia justified the deep discounts by falsely claiming in
approval forms that the discounts were necessary to beat competitors and obtain entry into the
Panamanian market when, in fact, the discounts were necessary to generate funds to pay bribes
to government officials. With respect to the leisure trip for Government Official A, Garcia
prepared a fictitious letter and itinerary, and even used a personal e-mail account to avoid
detection of his corrupt activities. Finally, despite signing SAPâs Code of Conduct prohibiting
bribery, he engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme. Accordingly, Garcia violated Section
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1.

Undertaking

25. Respondent hereby undertakes that he shall cooperate fully with the Commission in
any and all investigations, litigations, administrative or other proceedings commenced by the

SEC Charges Former Software Executive With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2015-165

Washington D.C., Aug. 12, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a former executive at a worldwide
software manufacturer has agreed to settle charges that he violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by bribing Panamanian
government officials through an intermediary to procure software license sales.

An SEC investigation found that Vicente E. Garcia, the former vice president of global and strategic accounts for SAP SE, orchestrated a
scheme to pay $145,000 in bribes to one government official and promised to pay two others in order to obtain four contracts to sell SAP
software to the Panamanian government. He essentially caused SAP, which is headquartered in Germany and executes most of its sales
through a network of worldwide corporate partners, to sell software to a partner in Panama at discounts of up to 82 percent. The excessive
discounts enabled the partner to create a slush fund from its excessive earnings on the other end of the sales and tap that money to pay the
bribes to Panamanian government officials so SAP could sell the software. Garcia, who lives in Miami, also received kickbacks from the slush
fund into his bank account.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a criminal action against Garcia.

âGarcia attempted to avoid detection by arranging large, illegitimate discounts to a corporate partner in order to generate a cash pot to bribe
government officials and win business for SAP,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:

e The scheme lasted from 2009 to 2013.

e Garcia circumvented SAPâs internal controls by submitting various approval forms to SAP that falsified the reasons for the excessive
discounts to the local partner.

e Garcia used his SAP e-mail account and his personal e-mail account to communicate details of the bribery scheme and even identify
the government officials and intended monetary amounts.

e In an e-mail to one government official, Garcia attached a letter on SAP letterhead detailing fictional meetings in Mexico as requested
by the official in order to justify a trip there on false pretenses. The next day, Garcia sent a subsequent e-mail asking, âAny news ...?
Was the document OK for him? Can you ask him to finalize a deal for us in Feb-March, | need between $5 and $10 million.â

The SECâs order finds that Garcia violated the anti-bribery and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Garcia
consented to the entry of the cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $85,965, which is the total amount of kickbacks he
received, plus prejudgment interest of $6,430 for a total of $92,395.

The SECâs continuing investigation is being conducted by Ansu Banerjee and supervised by Alka Patel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of
the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California, and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

TO SECTION 21C OF THE
THE BANK OF NEW SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
YORK MELLON 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
CORPORATION, IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST
ORDER
Respondent.
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation (âBNY Mellonâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, BNY Mellon has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for
the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, BNY Mellon consents to the entry of this Order
Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set
forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and BNY Mellonâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery and internal accounting
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by BNY Mellon. The
violations took place during 2010 and 2011, when employees of BNY Mellon sought to
corruptly influence foreign officials in order to retain and win business managing and
servicing the assets of a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.

2. These officials sought, and BNY Mellon agreed to provide, valuable
internships for their family members. BNY Mellon provided the internships without
following its standard hiring procedures for interns, and the interns were not qualified for
BNY Mellonâs existing internship programs.

3. BNY Mellon failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls around its hiring practices sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its
employees were not bribing foreign officials in contravention of company policy.

BNY Mellon

4. BNY Mellon is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in New York,
New York. The companyâs common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: BK). BNY Mellon and its various
subsidiaries provide banking and financial services in North America and elsewhere around
the globe, including in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (âEMEAâ) region. Services
provided to EMEA region clients by BNY Mellon include custody and related services
through its global asset servicing unit (âBNYM Asset Servicingâ), and asset and wealth
management services through its global investment management business division (âBNYM
Asset Managementâ).

her Relevant Entiti nd Indivi ]

5. BNY Mellon Boutique (the âBoutiqueâ) is a wholly owned asset
management firm operating within BNYM Asset Management. Asset management services
provided by BNYM Asset Management are generally carried out in the EMEA region by
BNY Mellonâs various regional subsidiaries, including the Boutique.

6. Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund (the âMiddle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fundâ) is a government body responsible for management and administration of
assets of a Middle Eastern country, as entrusted to it by that countryâs Minister of Finance.
The Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund is wholly owned by that country and was created

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
to perform the function of generating revenue for it. The Minister of Finance serves as
Chairman of the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fundâs Board of Directors and its most
senior members are political appointees. The Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund
generally hires external managers to make day-to-day investment decisions concerning its
assets.

7. European Office (the âEuropean Officeâ) is the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fundâs office in Europe. The European Office is responsible for managing a portion
of the assets entrusted to the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. Unlike the Middle
Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund, its parent, the European Office generally uses its own in-
house investment professionals to actively manage assets for which it is responsible.

8. Officials X and Y are government officials affiliated with the Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund. Official X was a senior official with the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fund during the relevant time period. Official Y was a senior official at the European
Office during the relevant time period.

9, Interns A, B and C (collectively, the âInternsâ) are relatives of Officials X
and Y. Interns A and B are the son and nephew, respectively, of Official X. Intern C is the
son of Official Y. All three Interns were recent college graduates during the relevant time
period.

BNY Mellonâs Business with the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund

10. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellonâs business in the EMEA region
collected fees for services provided to the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. Those
fees arose from government contracts awarded to BNY Mellon through a process requiring
approval from certain foreign government officials, and also from additional assets allocated
to BNY Mellon under existing contracts at the discretion of certain foreign government
officials.

11. The Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund first became a client of BNYM
Asset Servicing in 2000, when the European Office awarded to BNY Mellon custody of
certain assets. Since then, BNY Mellon has earned regular fees for the safekeeping and
administration of Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund assets. According to the terms of
the custody agreement, these fees are subject to increase from time to time as the European
Office allocates additional assets to BNY Mellon. While the total amount of Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund assets under custody by BNY Mellon has varied over time, during
the relevant time period BNY Mellon held Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund assets
totaling approximately $55 billion.

12. BNY Mellon entered an additional agreement with the European Office in
2003 permitting BNYM Asset Servicing to loan out certain of the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fund assets under custody within set guidelines, which varied over time.â This

 

* Such âsecurities lendingâ generally involves loaning a stock, derivative or other security to an individual
investor or firm. It is frequently done as part of a âshort sellingâ strategy on the part of the borrower, who
hopes to profit by immediately selling the security and then buying it back later at a lower price.

3
securities lending arrangement significantly increased BNY Mellonâs revenues from its
dealings with the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. In 2010 and 2011, BNYM Asset
Servicing repeatedly sought to modify the lending guidelines, which had been significantly
restricted following the 2008 economic crash, in order to bring the guidelines back to pre-
2008 levels and further grow the securities lending business with the Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund. During the relevant time period, BNYM Asset Servicing sought to
increase the amount of assets under custody from the European Office.

13. In 2009, the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund became a client of
BNYM Asset Management when the fund entered into an investment management agreement
designating the Boutique to manage assets worth approximately $711 million (the âBoutique
mandateâ). The bulk of the assets under the investment management agreement were funded
in November 2009, with an additional portion transferring to BNY Mellon in June 2010.
Official X was BNYM Asset Managementâs principal point of contact in connection with the
Boutique mandate. According to the terms of the agreement, the amount of assets under
management was subject to change, as the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund could
allocate additional assets to the Boutique mandate at any time. In June 2010, the Middle
Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund transferred an additional $689,000 to BNY Mellon under the
Boutique mandate. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon sought to increase the
amount of its Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund assets under management.

The Internships

14. Officials X and Y requested that BNY Mellon provide their family members
with valuable internships. Officials X and Y made numerous follow-up requests about the
status, timing and other details of the internships for their relatives after the internships had
been offered, and delivering the internships as requested was seen by certain relevant BNY
Mellon employees as a way to influence the officialsâ decisions.

15. In February 2010, at the conclusion of a business meeting, Official X made a
personal and discreet request that BNY Mellon provide internships to two of his relatives:
his son, Intern A, and nephew, Intern B. As a Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund
department head, Official X had authority over allocations of new assets to existing managers
such as the Boutique, and was viewed within BNY Mellon as a âkey decision makerâ at the
Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. Official X later persistently inquired of BNY
Mellon employees concerning the status of his internship request, asking whether and when
BNY Mellon would deliver the internships. At one point, Official X said to his primary
contact at BNY Mellon that the request represented an âopportunityâ for BNY Mellon, and
that the official could secure internships for his family members from a competitor of BNY
Mellon if it did not satisfy his personal request. The same BNY Mellon employee later wrote
toa BNY Mellon colleague that Official X had become âangryâ because BNY Mellon was
experiencing delays in delivering the internships, and had openly questioned the employeeâs
job performance and professionalism because of the delays.

16. As reflected in contemporaneous e-mails and other documents, BNY Mellon
delivered the valuable internship sought by Official X in order to assist BNY Mellon in
obtaining or retaining business. For example:

4
e A Boutique account manager wrote in a February 2010 e-mail concerning the
internship request for Interns A and B that BNY Mellon was ânot in a position to
reject the request from a commercial point of viewâ even though it was a âpersonal
requestâ from Official X. The employee stated: âby not allowing the internships to
take place, we potentially jeopardize our mandate with [the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fund].â

e In June 2010, an employee of BNY Mellon with primary responsibility for the Asset
Management relationship with the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund wrote of
the internships for Interns A and B: âI want more money for this. I expect more for
this... . Weâre doing [Official X] a favor.â

e Ina separate e-mail to a different BNY Mellon colleague, the same employee stated
âT am working on an expensive âfavorâ for [Official X] â an internship for his son and
cousin (donât mention to him as this is not official).â

e The same employee advised a colleague in human resources: â[W]e have to be
careful about this. This is more of a personal request . . . [Official X] doesnât want
[the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund] to know about it.â The same employee
later directed his administrative assistant to refrain from sending e-mail
correspondence concerning Official Xâs internship request âbecause it was a personal
favor.â

After granting Official Xâs request to hire Interns A and B, BNY Mellon retained the
Boutique mandate, and further assets were transferred to BNY Mellon by Official Xâs
department within a few months.

17. In February 2010, around the same time that Official X made his initial
internship request, Official Y asked through a subordinate European Office employee that
BNY Mellon provide an internship to the officialâs son, Intern C. As a senior official at the
European Office, Official Y had authority to make decisions directly impacting BNY
Mellonâs business. Internal BNY Mellon documents reflected Official Yâs importance in this
regard, stating that Official Y was âcrucial to both retaining and gaining new businessâ for
BNY Mellon. One or more European Office employees acting on Official Yâs behalf later
inquired repeatedly about the status and details of the internship, including during discussions
of the transfer of European Office assets to BNY Mellon. At the time of Official Yâs initial
request, a number of recent client service issues had threatened to weaken the relationship
between BNY Mellon and the European Office.

18. The BNY Mellon employee with primary responsibility for managing the
custody relationship with the European Office viewed Official Yâs request as important to
assist BNYM Asset Servicing in obtaining or retaining business. For example:

e The BNY Mellon custody relationship manager explained to more senior officers
within BNY Mellon that granting Official Yâs request was likely to âinfluence any
future decisions taken within [the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund].â

5
e The same BNY Mellon relationship manager expressed to colleagues his concern that
one of BNY Mellonâs competitors would agree to hire Intern C if BNY Mellon would
not, and that BNY Mellon might lose market share to the competitor as a result.

e The relationship manager wrote: âIts [sic] silly things like this that help influence
who ends up with more assets / retaining dominant position.â

e The relationship manager separately wrote that meeting Official Yâs requests was the
âonly wayâ to increase BNY Mellonâs share of business from the European Office,
aside from obtaining assets in new countries.

After granting Official Yâs request to hire his son, Intern C, BNY Mellon retained its existing
custody and securities lending business from the European Office, which continued to grow.

19. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon had an established summer
internship program for undergraduates as well as a separate summer program for
postgraduates actively pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or similar
degree. Admission to the BNY Mellon postgraduate internship program was highly
competitive and characterized by stringent hiring standards. To recruit postgraduates, BNY
Mellon had relationships with a small number of the most highly selective schools in the
United States and the United Kingdom from which it sourced candidates. Successful
applicants had to achieve a minimum grade point average, and had to advance through
multiple rounds of interviews in addition to having relevant prior work experience and a
demonstrated affinity for and interest in financial services work. BNY Mellon also placed an
emphasis on relevant leadership experience.

20. The Interns did not meet these rigorous criteria and BNY Mellon did not
evaluate or hire the Interns through its established internship programs. For example, as
recent graduates not enrolled in any degree program, the Interns did not meet the basic
entrance standard fora BNY Mellon postgraduate internship. Further, contrary to BNY
Mellonâs goal of converting student interns to full-time hires, the Interns were to return to the
Middle East at the conclusion of their internship and BNY Mellon had no plan to hire them as
full-time employees. Nor did the individual Interns have the requisite academic or
professional credentials for its existing internship programs.

21. Though they did not meet the criteria of BNY Mellonâs existing internship
programs, BNY Mellon hired Interns A, B and C. Contrary to its standard practice, BNY
Mellon decided to hire the Interns before even meeting or interviewing them. Indeed, the
special âwork experiencesâ sought by Officials X and Y were not regular undergraduate or
graduate summer internships at all, but customized one-of-a-kind training programs. The
internships were valuable work experience, and the requesting officials derived significant
personal value in being able to confer this benefit on their family members. As requested by
Officials X and Y, BNY Mellon designed customized work experiences for the Interns.
These bespoke internships were rotational in nature, meaning that Interns A, B and C had the
opportunity to work in a number of different BNY Mellon business units, enhancing the
value of the work experience beyond that normally provided to BNY Mellon interns. Interns

6
A and B were placed in Boston, Massachusetts and were employed by BNY Mellon from
August 6, 2010 through February 25, 2011. Intern C was onboarded and placed in London,
England and interned with BNY Mellon from July 4, 2010 through December 17, 2010.
These approximately six-month internships were significantly longer than the work
experiences typically afforded to BNY Mellon interns through the normal summer internship
program.

22. The internships were neither inexpensive nor easy for BNY Mellon to
structure. BNY Mellon determined, because Interns A and B had already graduated from
college, that Interns A and B should be paid above the normal salary scale for BNY Mellon
undergraduate interns but below the scale for postgraduate interns. Intern C was unpaid.
BNY Mellon also coordinated obtaining visas for all three of the Interns so that they could
travel from the Middle East to work in the countries in which they were placed. BNY Mellon
paid the legal fees and filing costs related to the visas. As the BNY Mellon Asset
Management employee responsible for arranging two of the three internships wrote in a
contemporaneous e-mail, the internships constituted an âexpensive favorâ for the requesting
foreign official.

23. BNY Mellon hired all three of the Interns, with the knowledge and approval
of senior BNY Mellon employees:

e According to the BNY Mellon Asset Management employee with primary
responsibility for arranging the internships for Interns A and B, he had
initially struggled to deliver the internships as requested by Official X until
the internships had the âblessingâ of a senior BNY Mellon employee, after
which âit started to move.â The senior employee facilitated the internships by
contacting human resources on behalf of the Interns, forwarding their resumes
and stating that he âwould like us to support.â

e The BNY Mellon relationship manager with lead responsibility for arranging
the internship for Intern C sent an e-mail to two senior BNYM Asset
Servicing officers describing Official Yâs request and seeking their âsupportâ
for the internship. The same relationship manager later wrote to BNY Mellon
colleagues seeking assistance in arranging the internship and stating â[p|lease
know that this request has the backing of both [senior officers].â

e In October 2010, Official Y made a further request that BNY Mellon modify
the custom internship it had created for Intern C so that he could rotate
through an additional BNY Mellon business unit. This request was also
granted with the knowledge and approval of senior BNY Mellon employees.

24. The Interns were less than exemplary employees. On at least one occasion,
Interns A and B were confronted by a BNY Mellon human resources employee concerning
their repeated absences from work. A Boutique portfolio manager who worked with Intern C
observed that his performance was âokayâ and that âhe wasnât actually as hardworking as I
would have hoped.â Despite these issues, BNY Mellon accommodated the Interns in order to
favorably influence Officials X and Y.
BNY Mellonâs FCPA-Related Policies, Training and Internal Controls

25. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon had a code of conduct, as well
as a specific FCPA policy, which prohibited BNY Mellon employees from violating the
statute. While BNY Mellonâs policies stated that âany money ... gift... or anything of
valueâ provided to a foreign official might constitute a bribe, employees were provided with
little additional guidance that was tailored to the types of risks related to hiring faced by BNY
Mellonâs international asset servicing unit and asset management business division.

26. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon provided training on
employeesâ obligations under the FCPA and BNY Mellonâs policies, but did not ensure that
all employees took the training or understood BNY Mellonâs policies.

27. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon had few specific controls
relating to the hiring of customers and relatives of customers, including foreign government
officials. Sales staff and client relationship managers were permitted wide discretion in
making initial hiring decisions and human resources was not trained to flag hires that were
potentially problematic. Senior managers were able to approve hires requested by foreign
officials with no mechanism to ensure that potential hiring violations were reviewed by
anyone with a legal or compliance background. BNY Mellonâs system of internal
accounting controls was insufficiently tailored to the corruption risks inherent in the hiring
of client referrals, and therefore inadequate to fully effectuate BNY Mellonâs policy against
bribery of foreign officials.

Legal Standar n
FCPA Violation

28. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a
cease-and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate
any provision of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew
or should have known would contribute to such violation.

29. Section 30A of the Exchange Act prohibits any issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or any officer, director,
employee, or agent acting on behalf of such issuer, in order to obtain or retain business, from
corruptly giving or authorizing the giving of, anything of value to any foreign official for the
purposes of influencing the official or inducing the official to act in violation of his or her
lawful duties, or to secure any improper advantage, or to induce a foreign official to use his
influence with a foreign governmental instrumentality to influence any act or decision of
such government or instrumentality. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

30. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that (1) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs
general or specific authorization; (11) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit

8
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II) to maintain
accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

31. As described above, BNY Mellon violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act
by corruptly providing valuable internships to relatives of foreign officials from the Middle
Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund in order to assist BNY Mellon in retaining and obtaining
business. BNY Mellon also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, by failing to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that its employees were not bribing foreign officials.

Commission Consideration of BNY Mellonâs Cooperation and
Remedial Efforts

32. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered cooperation
BNY Mellon afforded to the Commission staff and the remedial acts undertaken by BNY
Mellon. Prior to the investigation by the Commission of the Interns, BNY Mellon had
begun a process of enhancing its anti-corruption compliance program including: making
changes to the Anti-Corruption Policy to explicitly address the hiring of government
officialsâ relatives; requiring that every application for a full-time hire or an internship
be routed through a centralized HR application process; enhancing its Code of Conduct
to require that every year each employee certifies that he or she is not responsible for
hiring through a non-centralized channel; and requiring as part of a centralized
application process that each applicant indicate whether she or a close personal
associate is or has recently been a government official, and, if so, additional review by
BNY Mellonâs anti-corruption office is mandated.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the
sanctions agreed to in Respondentâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent BNY Mellon cease
and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations
of Sections 30A and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§
78m(b)(2)(B), and 78dd-1].

B. Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay
disgorgement of $8,300,000, prejudgment interest of $1,500,000 and a civil
money penalty in the amount of $5,000,000, for a total payment of
$14,800,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the
general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue

9
pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and 31 U.S.C. $3717. Payment must
be made in one of the following ways:

() Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission,
which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Pedwire mstructions upon
request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC Web site at http:/Awww.sec.gov/about/oftfices/ofm htm;
or

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashterâs check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter
identifying BN'Y Mellon as the Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of
these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to
Paul G. Block, Assistant Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 33 Arch Street, a3"" Fiocor, Boston, MA O2110.

C. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in
excess of $5,000,000 based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation. If
at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement
(âDivisionâ) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided
materially false or misleading information or materials to the Commission or in a
related proceeding, the Division may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to
the Respondent, petition the Commission to reopen this matter and seek an order
directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil penalty. Respondent may
contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether it
knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1)
contest the findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy,

SEC Charges BNY Mellon With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2015-170

Washington D.C., Aug. 18, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that BNY Mellon has agreed to pay $14.8
million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing valuable student internships to family members
of foreign government officials affiliated with a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.

An SEC investigation found that BNY Mellon did not evaluate or hire the family members through its existing, highly competitive internship
programs that have stringent hiring standards and require a minimum grade point average and multiple interviews. The family members did
not meet the rigorous criteria yet were hired with the knowledge and approval of senior BNY Mellon employees in order to corruptly influence
foreign officials and win or retain contracts to manage and service the assets of the sovereign wealth fund.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, the sovereign wealth fund officials requested that BNY Mellon
provide their family members with internships, and they made numerous follow-up requests about the status, timing, and other details of the
internships for their relatives. BNY Mellon employees viewed the internships as important to keep the sovereign wealth fundâs business.

âThe FCPA prohibits companies from improperly influencing foreign officials with âanything of value,â and therefore cash payments, gifts,
internships, or anything else used in corrupt attempts to win business can expose companies to an SEC enforcement action,â said Andrew J.
Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. âBNY Mellon deserved significant sanction for providing valuable student internships to
family members of foreign officials to influence their actions.â

The SECâs order finds that BNY Mellon lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect the improper hiring practices. The company
did have an FCPA compliance policy, but maintained few specific controls around the hiring of customers and relatives of customers,
including foreign government officials. Sales staff and client relationship managers were permitted wide discretion in their initial hiring
decisions, and human resources personnel were not trained to flag potentially problematic hires. Senior managers were able to approve
hires requested by foreign officials with no mechanism for review by legal or compliance staff. BNY Mellonâs system of internal accounting
controls was insufficiently tailored to the corruption risks inherent in the hiring of client referrals, and therefore was inadequate to fully
effectuate BNY Mellonâs stated policy against bribery of foreign officials.

âFinancial services providers face unique corruption risks when seeking to win business in international markets, and we will continue to
scrutinize industries that have not been vigilant about complying with the FCPA,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement
Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

The SECâs order finds that in 2010 and 2011, BNY Mellon violated the anti-bribery and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, the company agreed to pay $8.3 million in disgorgement, $1.5 million in prejudgment
interest, and a $5 million penalty. The SEC considered the companyâs remedial acts and its cooperation with the investigation when
determining a settlement.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Eric Heining, Rory Alex, Richard Harper, and Rachel Hershfang of the Boston Regional Office. The
case was supervised by Paul G. Block of the FCPA Unit.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

 

COMMISSION,
Civil Action No.
Plaintiff,
Vv.
HITACHI, LTD.,
Defendant.
COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from violations of the books and records and internal accounting
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)-(B)]
by defendant Hitachi, Ltd. (âHitachiâ).

2. In 2005, Hitachi created a subsidiary in South Afmica for the purpose of establishing
a local presence in that country to pursue lucrative public and private contracts, including
government contracts to build two new major power stations.

3. Hitachi sold 25% of the stock in the newly created subsidiary to Chancellor House
Holdings (Pty) Ltd. (âChancellorâ), a local South African company that was a front for the African
National Congress (âANCâ), South Africaâs ruling political party. Hitachiâs arrangement gave

Chancellor â and by proxy the ANC â the ability to share in the profits from any power station
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 2 of 21

contracts secured by Hitachi. Hitachi also entered into an undisclosed âsuccess feeâ arrangement
with Chancellor, wherein Chancellor would be entitled to âsuccess feesâ in the event that the
contract awards were âsubstantially as a resultâ of Chancellorâs efforts.

4, During the bidding process, Hitachi was aware that Chancellor was a funding
vehicle for the ANC. Hitachi nevertheless continued to partner with Chancellor and encourage
Chancellorâs use of its political influence to help obtain the government contracts.

5. As a result, Hitachi was awarded power station contracts in South Africa worth
approximately $5.6 billion.â In April and July 2008, Hitachi paid the ANC â through Chancellor â
âsuccess feesâ totaling approximately $1 million.

6. Hitachiâs South African subsidiary inaccurately recorded its âsuccess feeâ payments
to Chancellor as âconsulting feesâ in its books and records for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The inaccurate books and records of Hitachiâs subsidiary were consolidated into Hitachiâs financial
statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, which were filed with the Commission.

7. In 2010, Hitachiâs South African subsidiary also inaccurately recorded a dividend
worth over a million dollars to be paid to Chancellor, its 25% shareholder. The journal entry
recorded this dividend as âDividends Declaredâ in the subsidiaryâs books and records for the year
ended December 31, 2010. The books and records did not reflect that the dividend was, in fact, an
amount due for payment to a foreign political party in exchange for its political influence in

assisting Hitachi land two government contracts. The subsidiaryâs inaccurate books and records

 

| Where contract amounts, success fees, dividend declarations, and other figures were in
South African rand, those figures have been converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
prevailing at the relevant time.
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 3 of 21

were consolidated into Hitachiâs financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011,
which were filed with the Commission.

8. Hitachi has violated, and unless enjoined will again violate, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)] by failing to
make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflected the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hitachi. Hitachi also has violated, and
unless enjoined will again violate, Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.

Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)] by failing to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; that transactions were recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for
assets; that access to assets was permitted only in accordance with managementâs general or
specific authorization; and that the recorded accountability for assets was compared with the
existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action was taken with respect to any
differences.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), & 78aa].

10. Venue in the District of Columbia is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because acts or transactions constituting federal securities law violations

occurred in this district and, at the time of the violations, Hitachi transacted business in this district.

DEFENDANT

11. Hitachi, Ltd. is a multinational conglomerate that, among other things, designs and
constructs power stations. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan and, including its
subsidiaries, has more than 320,000 employees worldwide.

12. At the trme of the violations, and from at least January 1, 2005 until April 26, 2012,
Hitachiâs American Depositary Shares (âADSsâ) â representing shares of common stock â were
registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 781] and
were listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Hitachi was an issuer of securities in the
United States and filed reports on Form 20-F with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m]. On April 16, 2012, Hitachi filed a Form 25 with the
Commission voluntarily withdrawing its ADSs from listing and registration. The delisting was
effective ten days later, on April 26, 2012, and Hitachiâs duty to file reports under Section 13(a) of
the Exchange Act was automatically suspended at the same time as the delisting. On April 27,
2012, Hitachi filed a Form 15F with the Commission voluntarily terminating its registration under
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and terminating its duty to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. Termination of Hitachiâs registration and duty to file reports with the
Commission became effective on July 26, 2012. Hitachiâs ADSs continue to be traded on the U.S.
over-the-counter market. If Hitachi were to file a new registration statement registering an offering
of its securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 77a, et seq.], or a new

Exchange Act registration statement registering a class of its securities under Section 12 of the
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 5 of 21

Exchange Act, it would once again become subject to reporting obligations under Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act.
OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

13. Hitachi Power Europe GmbH (âHPEâ) was an international supplier of boilers for
power stations. Before 2006, HPE was known as Babcock Hitachi Europe GmbH.â At all relevant
times, HPE was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi based in Germany. In 2014, HPEâs projects
and personnel were transferred to a joint venture formed between Hitachi and another Japanese
conglomerate.

14, Hitachi Power Africa (Pty) Ltd. (âHPAâ) executed power station orders in South
Africa. HPA was established in 2005 and, at all relevant times, was a majority-owned subsidiary
of HPE based in South Africa. In 2014, HPAâs projects and personnel were transferred to the joint
venture above.

15. The African National Congress has been the ruling political party of the
Government of South Africa since 1994.

16. Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. (âEskomâ) is a government-owned and government-run
. public utility established by the Government of South Africa. Eskom supplies approximately 95%
of all electricity in South Africa and the Government of South Africa is Eskomâs sole shareholder.
Thus, Eskom is an instrumentality of a foreign government. From 2006 to at least 2008, Eskomâs
chairman simultaneously served as a member of the ANCâs National Executive Committee.

Johannesburg that in the 1950s housed the law firm of Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo, two
future ANC presidents. From 2005 to at least 2008, Chancellorâs parent organization, Chancellor
House Trust, was administered by a member of the ANC National Executive Committee and a
director of Eskom Enterprises, an Eskom subsidiary.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

 

Background of Hitachiâs Effort to Enter the South African Power Market

18. In 2003, Hitachi began looking to enter the South African power market. At the
time, Eskom, the largest government-owned and government-run public utility in South Africa,
was planning to build new power stations in South Africa. Through its subsidiary in Europe,
Hitachi hired an expert in the South African power industry as a consultant to explore the potential
business opportunity. HPEâs consultant met with public and private power producers, including
Eskom, and learned of Eskomâs plans to build two new power stations, the Medupi power station
and the Kusile power station.

19. HPEâs consultant â who was later appointed as an executive at HPA â never
received training from Hitachi regarding compliance with the FCPA. In fact, neither HPE nor
HPA conducted any FCPA-specific compliance training for any HPE or HPA officers or
employees between January 2005 and December 2008.

20. In April 2005, HPE held meetings in South Africa with senior Hitachi executives to
discuss the business opportunities in that country. Hitachi decided to form a subsidiary in South
Africa â the entity that would become known as HPA â for the purpose of establishing a local
presence to help Hitachi pursue contracts with public and private entities in South Africa, including

the Eskom power station contracts.
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 7 of 21

21. The attendees of the April 2005 meetings also agreed that, in establishing a local
presence in South Africa, Hitachi would seek to identify a local black-owned entity or entities with
whom HPA could partner in connection with its submission of bids, or âtenders,â for government
business. By partnering with a local black-owned entity, HPA would seek to qualify under the
requirements of South Africaâs Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 (âBEEâ), which
promoted participation in the South African economy by companies that were at least 25% owned
by black South Africans or black-owned South African entities. In general, companies that
qualified under the terms of the BEE enjoyed preferential status in government procurements.

Before Submitting Tenders to Win the Eskom Contracts, Hitachi Enters into a Relationship
with Chancellor

Hitachi Identifies Chancellor for a 25% Equity Stake in HPA

 

22. In seeking local BEE partners, HPE prioritized a prospective partnerâs ability to
exert political influence over engineering or operational capacity. Consistent with this criterion,
Hitachi identified Chancellor as a potential partner. Hitachi understood, and it was commonly
known, that both Chancellor and its parent organization, Chancellor House Trust, had extensive
political connections within the Government of South Africa, with the ANC, and with Eskom. For
example, Hitachi knew or could have learned:
Â° An administrator of Chancellor House Trust was a member of the
ANC National Executive Committee from 2002 to 2007;

. The chairman of Eskomâs board of directors, who also was a
member of the ANC National Executive Committee, co-owned a
separate investment company with the chairman of Chancellor

House Trust;
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 8 of 21

Â° An administrator of Chancellor House Trust also was a director of
Eskom Enterprises, an Eskom subsidiary; and

. Chancellorâs chairman was married to a family member of Eskomâs

chief executive officer.

23. While its political connections were extensive, Chancellor lacked any engineering
or operational capabilities that could assist Hitachi with contract performance should it secure the
Eskom contracts. Chancellor differed in this respect from at least one other local South African
entity that Hitachi initially considered for partnership with HPA.

24. Hitachi was fully aware of Chancellorâs operational shortcomings, and sought a
partnership with Chancellor precisely because Chancellor would not provide it operational support.
From an internal profile of Chancellor prepared in 2005, HPEâs senior management was advised
that Chancellor âhas a lean HQ staff and it does not get involved in the operational business of the
companies in which it invests. Support for invested companies is provided via networking at board
level.â The internal profile also specifically highlighted Chancellorâs âgood connections within
Eskom.â

25. Another 2005 Hitachi document identified Chancellor as a âpotentially suitableâ
BEE partner that was âpolitically preferred.â In the documentâs margin next to the discussion of
Chancellor are handwritten notes of an HPE executive that include the words ârecommendation by
Escom [sic]â and âANC treasury.â

26. In a 2010 email, a Hitachi executive who also had served as an alternative director
of HPA in South Africa in 2005 and 2006 wrote to senior Hitachi officials in Japan: âWhen we

; adopted [Chancellor] at the time of HPA establishment, we took ANC influence into consideration

and still we believed it was a right decision.â
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 9 of 21

27. In October 2005, HPE conducted Hitachiâs due diligence of Chancellor. This due
diligence work lasted only a few daysâ time and was not conducted in accordance with any existing
Hitachi procedures. During the course of the Commissionâs investigation, Hitachi was unable to
locate its report reflecting the due diligence conducted of Chancellor.

28. On November 24, 2005, HPE formally entered into a shareholdersâ agreement with
Chancellor. Pursuant to this agreement, Hitachi â through HPE â sold Chancellor a 25% equity
stake in the newly formed HPA. Hitachi also sold a 5% equity stake in HPA to another local entity
~âasmall five-person womenâs group â with HPE maintaining the remaining 70% of the equity in
HPA. In February 2006, a public launch ceremony was held, at which HPA and its BEE
shareholders were introduced to the public.

29. The shareholdersâ agreement expressly provided that Chancellorâs âcontributionâ to
HPA would include, among other things, âlobbying the public and the private sector in the
Republic for new business and to promote [HPAâs] expansion initiatives and to enhance and/or
protect [HPAâs] existing and future business interests within the Republicâ and âassistance in the
identification, preparation, processing, monitoring, support and procuring of tenders from central,
provincial and local government, parastatals and the private sector.â

30. Hitachi charged Chancellor only approximately $190,819 for its 25% equity stake
in HPA. In addition, as part of the transaction, Chancellor obtained a seat on HPAâs board, with
Chancellorâs chairman becoming a director of HPA.

31. In an email dated April 20, 2010, an HPE executive stated, âAfter [an HPA
executive] evaluated each company, he chose ANC-related CH[ancellor] (25%) and a lady-group
(5%) G6 members then), which included the lady ... who had a good relationship with the Mbeki

Administration, to achieve 30%.â
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 10 of 21

The Undisclosed âSuccess Feeâ Arrangement

32. An October 2005 draft of the shareholdersâ agreement for HPA included a specific
provision pursuant to which Chancellor would be financially rewarded in the event that its efforts
substantially resulted in Hitachi winning a government contract.

33. In a November 1, 2005 email, an HPA executive circulated a revised draft of the
shareholdersâ agreement in which the âsuccess feeâ provision had been removed from the attached
revised draft. In the transmittal email, HPA stated that HPE âsupports the principle of rewarding
successâ but that such an arrangement âwill be dealt with in a separate document.â

34. HPA removed the âsuccess feeâ arrangement from the shareholdersâ agreement at
the direction of HPE. As HPA explained in the November 1, 2005 email, âHPA will be required to
disclose the shareholders[â] agreement when BEE audits are conducted by customers, and it is felt
that such a clause could be interpreted in a way in which it is not intended.â

35. Thereafter, Hitachi memorialized its promise to pay Chancellor for its exertion of
influence during the Eskom tender process in a separate, unsigned side-arrangement. The
arrangement was memorialized in a document entitled, Proposal for payment of success fees to
HPAâ[s] Empowerment Shareholders (the âSuccess Fee Arrangementâ), which stated, in part:

[HPE] and HPA believe in rewarding success where it is due. ...
Entitlement to payment of a success fee will be dependent upon the
active involvement and support provided to HPA during the tender /
adjudication phase of a project, and the award of an order to HPA
must be substantially as a result of [Chancellorâs] efforts within [its]
responsible sphere of influence.
36. In August 2006, an HPE executive reported to HPEâs board of directors that HPE

and HPA had agreed to a ââsuccess feeâ arrangement with its BEE partners âas an incentive to them

to help the Company win orders.â

10
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 11 of 21

After Entering into a Success Fee Arrangement with Chancellor, Hitachi Submits Tenders
for Work on Two Power Stations

37. In May 2006, Eskom invited Hitachi and other contractors to tender for work
involved in building the Medupi power station. The project included both the boiler and turbine
components of the power station. In November 2006, Hitachi â through HPE and HPA bidding in
consortium â formally tendered for work on both the boiler and turbine components. Shortly
thereafter, Hitachi withdrew its tender for the turbines for capacity reasons and proceeded with just
its tender to build the boiler works.

38. Later, in the summer of 2007, Eskom also initiated a non-tender process for the
Kusile power station and invited Hitachi to submit an offer for work on the boiler component.
Hitachi â again, through HPE and HPA bidding in consortium â then submitted its initial offer for
work on the boiler component of the Kusile power station.

39, Hitachi considered its entry into the South African power market a high corporate
priority, and HPAâs tenders for the Eskom contracts had the personal attention of Hitachiâs senior
management in Japan. On July 20, 2007, a high-level Hitachi executive wrote to the Minister of
South Africaâs Department of Public Enterprises, the ministry with oversight responsibility for
Eskom, that he and Hitachi âfully supportâ HPAâs power station tenders, and that âI am
continuously monitoring the development of the [Medupi] project.â

During the Pendency of the Eskom Tenders, the ANC Confirms that Chancellor Is an ANC
Funding Vehicle

40. While Hitachi was preparing and submitting its first tender for the Medupi power
station, the South African press publicly exposed Chancellor â with whom Hitachi had entered into
both a shareholdersâ agreement and an undisclosed âsuccess feeâ arrangement â as an alter ego of

the ANC.

11
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 12 of 21

Al. In August 2006, an HPA director received a telephone call from a reporter with the
Mail & Guardian, a South African weekly newspaper that focuses on political analysis,
investigative reporting, and South African news and culture. The reporter asked HPA to comment
on whether there was a link between HPAâs 25% shareholder, Chancellor, and the ANC. HPA
declined to comment.

42. On November 10, 2006, the same day that Hitachi submitted its bid for the Medupi
power station contract, the Mail & Guardian published an article entitled, The ANCâs New
Funding Front. The article exposed Chancellor as a business front set up by the ANC âto seek
profit on its behalf,â generally by acquiring âempowermentâ stakes in businesses seeking state
procurements. âThis means,â the Mail & Guardian stated, âthe ANC, as ruling party, has been
both player and referee.â

43. Both HPA and HPE were aware of the Mail & Guardianâs reporting on
Chancellorâs relationship to the ANC. On November 13, 2006, an HPA director forwarded two

HPE executives a copy of The ANCâs New Funding Front. The same HPA director reported to the

 

HPE executives that he had spoken to Chancellorâs chairman, who had denied the allegations in
the newspaper.

44. In January 2007, both the Mail & Guardian and a separate South African
newspaper, the Financial Mail, published articles that confirmed Chancellor was a funding vehicle
for the ANC. In Financing the ANC, published on January 19, 2007, the Financial Mail quoted
the ANC Secretary General and organizational head of the ANCâs operations as admitting that
Chancellor was an âANC vehicleâ that existed for the sole purpose of funding the ANC. The Mail
& Guardian reported this same admission by the ANC Secretary General a week later, in an article

entitled, ANC Admits It Used BEE Funding Front.

 

12
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 13 of 21

45. After the ANC Secretary General acknowledged publicly that Chancellor was an
ANC funding âvehicle,â an HPA director spoke to Chancellor's chairman, who admitted this fact.

Hitachi Continues to Encourage Chancellor to Exert Its Political Influence to Assist in
Winning the Eskom Contracts

46. Notwithstanding confirmation in the press that Chancellor was an ANC alter ego,
and thus a foreign political party, Hitachi maintained its relationship with Chancellor. As pressure
from Hitachi executives in Japan mounted, HPE and HPA continued to encourage Chancellor to
exert its political influence to win the Eskom contracts.

47. As specified in the shareholdersâ agreement, Chancellor networked to help schedule
meetings with government officials and lobbied on behalf of the HPE and HPA consortium bid.

48. On May 22, 2007, an executive at Hitachi, Ltd. Power Systems, an internal division
of Hitachi, emailed the management team of HPE that, â[g]iven the potential of the South African
market and its importance for Hitachi group, HPE together with Hitachi Power Systems Group
shall devote every effort to winning [the Medupi boiler contract].â A second email sent a week
later relayed that Hitachi in Japan was âworr[ied] about the current situation.â

49, In a May 30, 2007 email, an HPE executive emailed other Hitachi executives that,
even though HPE and HPA âhad not been successful in receiving any update [from Eskom],â
Chancellor and HPAâs 5% shareholder were doing âtheir very bestâ to bring Hitachiâs offer for the
Eskom contracts âin first place.â

50. In August 2007, Eskom issued a letter of award for the boiler and turbine
components of the Medupi power station to the only bidder competing with Hitachi, a consortium

led by a large French multinational company. :
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 14 of 21

Sl. In mid-September 2007, HPE learned that there were difficulties in the
negotiations between Eskom and the French consortium for the Medupi boiler works. HPE
directed Chancellor to help Hitachi win reconsideration of the boiler component of the Medupi
power station contract.

52. On October 8, 2007, HPE executives executed a code of conduct for HPE that,
among other things, specifically prohibited contributions to political parties and required
compliance with all laws. Despite this code of conduct, HPE continued in its relationship with
Chancellor to win government contracts from Eskom.

53. On October 15, 2007, an HPE executive emailed an internal Hitachi memorandum
on the status of the Eskom negotiations to another HPE executive. Under the headings âDecision
Criteriaâ and âMain influencing criteria,â the memorandum expressed confidence that Eskomâs
ANC-led board would favor Hitachi: âBalance of political power in board (ANC driven currently
in our favour).â

54. This prediction proved correct. On October 30, 2007, Eskom and Hitachi â through
HPE and HPA â executed the first of two contracts: a $2.91 billion contract to build the boiler
works for the Medupi power station.

55. In December 2007, the Financial Mail published another article about Hitachiâs
relationship with Chancellor. The Financial Mail quoted an HPE executive as saying that there
was âno proofâ that Chancellor was an ANC front company and if Chancellor was indeed a front-
for the ANC, âthis would contradict our own governance rules.â In fact, as Hitachi knew well
before December 2007, and as the ANCâs Secretary General had confirmed publicly eleven

months earlier, Chancellor was an alter ego of the ANC.

14
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 15 of 21

56. A week after the publication of the Financial Mail article, on December 14, 2007,
Eskom and Hitachi â through HPE and HPA ~ executed the second of two contracts: a $2.71
billion contract to build the boiler works for the Kusile power station.

57. | The Medupi and Kusile power station contracts together accounted for
approximately $5.6 billion in business being awarded to Hitachi by Eskom, among the largest
government contracts ever awarded in South African history.

HPA Pays Chancellor, an ANC Front, Over $1.1 Million in Success Fees, Declares
Substantial Dividends to Chancellor, and Inaccurately Records these Transactions in Its
Books and Records

58. On April 14, 2008, HPA held its annual shareholders meeting. As reflected in the
meeting minutes, HPA agreed to pay a success fee to Chancellor to reward Chancellor for its
assistance in helping Hitachi secure the Eskom power station contracts.

59. Subsequently, Chancellor submitted two invoices to HPA for success fees, which
Chancellor called âtender supportâ fees. On April 30, 2008, HPA paid Chancellor a success fee of
approximately $965,222, based on the Medupi and Kusile power station contracts. On July 2,
2008, HPA paid Chancellor a second success fee of approximately $158,160, based on Eskomâs
acceptance of an option to expand the Kusile power station contract by another two boilers.
Overall, HPA paid success fees to Chancellor totaling approximately $1,123,382.

60. HPA recorded the success fees in its âconsulting feesâ expense account. The
âconsulting feesâ account was included in the profit and loss line item âAdministrative and other
expensesâ in HPAâs Annual Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. Those
financial statements were consolidated into Hitachi's financial statements and filed with the
Commission on Hitachiâs Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (filed July 27,
2009).

15
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 16 of 21

61. | HPE and HPA knew that its âsuccess feeâ payments were in fact payments to the
ANC, a foreign political party. While suggesting that Hitachi was contractually committed to
make these payments, an HPA executive further explained in an August 2012 recorded interview:

One also has to be sensitive to a foreign company operating in
[South Africa] where you have been alerted to the fact that now in
fact, you actually have a political party shareholder who is in
government. Itâs difficult; we were caught between a rock and a
hard place. If we treat them really badly, who knows what can
happen? We are dealing with a state-owned enterprise where the
bosses are appointed by the ANC.

62. On October 15, 2008, HPA executives executed a code of conduct for HPA. Like
the code of conduct executed by executives at HPE a year earlier, the HPA code of conduct, among
other things, specifically prohibited contributions to political parties and required compliance with
all laws.

63. As a result of Hitachi winning the Eskom power station contracts, Chancellor, as a
25% shareholder in HPA, was entitled to receive a 25% share of future profits derived from the
contracts in the form of HPA dividends. In 2010 and 2011, HPA declared and recorded a liability
in its books and records for dividends to be paid to Chancellor. HPAâs journal entries for these
transactions did not reflect that the dividends were, in fact, amounts due for payment to a foreign
political party for its assistance in securing government contracts.

64. On March 18, 2010, HPA declared a dividend of approximately $7,032,680 for all
shareholders based on 2009 profits, of which Chancellor was due a dividend of approximately
$1,758,170.

65. On April 30, 2010, HPA recorded a journal entry for âDividends Declared 18
March 2010â as a liability, with a corresponding reduction of equity in HPAâs books and records

for the year ended December 31, 2010. This dividend declaration reflected on the books and

16
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 17 of 21

records of HPA was consolidated into Hitachiâs financial statements, and filed with the
Commission on Hitachiâs Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 (filed June 24,
2011).

66. The following year, in March 2011, HPA declared a dividend of approximately
$13,073,300 for all shareholders based on 2010 profits, of which Chancellor was due a dividend of
approximately $3,268,325. On March 25, 2011, HPA recorded a journal entry for âDividend
Declaration based on 2010 resultsâ as a liability, with a corresponding reduction of equity in
HPAâs books and records for the year ended December 31, 2011. This dividend declaration
reflected on the books and records of HPA was consolidated into Hitachiâs financial statements for
the year ended March 31, 2012.

67. Hitachi, however, temporanly withheld payment of the 2010 and 2011 dividends to
Chancellor. In an addendum to the shareholdersâ agreement that HPE and Chancellor executed in
late May 2012, Chancellor provided its assurance that it would not pass on dividend payments
from Hitachi to any political party or official. Then, on or about June 29, 2012, Hitachi paid
Chancellor approximately $5,027,170 in what Hitachi deemed dividends and interest on such
dividends.

68. Approximately nineteen months later, in February 2014, HPE repurchased
Chancellorâs shares in HPA â shares that Chancellor had purchased in 2005 for only approximately
$190,819 â for approximately $4.4 million.

69. Thus, in total, Chancellor ~ the ANCâs funding vehicle â received approximately
$10.5 million from Hitachi, a return of over 5,000% on its investment in HPA.

70. During the time it was registered with the Commission, Hitachi failed to devise and
maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. HPE and HPA were able to enter into

17
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 18 of 21

a shareholdersâ agreement and an undisclosed âsuccess feeâ arrangement with Chancellor â a front
for the ANC â to pay that entity for exerting its political influence. Although HPE had a code of
conduct in place before the success fees were paid that specifically prohibited contributions to
political parties, HPA paid Chancellor more than $1.1 million pursuant to this side-arrangement.
HPA was able to do so despite a stream of reporting in the South African media that publicized the
fact that HPAâs 25% shareholder was a funding vehicle for the ANC.

71. HPA also was able to record Chancellorâs invoices for success fee payments as
âconsultingâ expenses, which they were not, without proper documentation or reasonable detail.
Hitachiâs internal accounting controls failed again when Hitachi declared and recorded as
dividends to be paid to Chancellor transactions that, in fact, would instead be payments to a foreign
political party for its assistance in securing government contracts. Among other further internal
accounting controls deficiencies, Hitachi failed to conduct adequate due diligence of Chancellor, a
potential agent and a potential shareholder of HPA, and to keep records of such due diligence, even
though Hitachi intended for Chancellor to use its political influence to help obtain government
contracts.

72. Hitachiâs internal accounting controls, or lack thereof, also were inadequate to
provide reasonable assurances that Hitachi would not violate its own codes of conduct and
compliance policies, the FCPA, or South African law. For example, Hitachi failed to adequately
supervise and ensure compliance with its policies and procedures, and neither HPE nor HPA
conducted any FCPA-specific compliance training during the time period in which Hitachi â
through HPE and HPA â was seeking lucrative contracts with an instrumentality of a foreign

government and authorizing the payments of âsuccess feesâ to a foreign political party.

or respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction while denying the
allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings,â and âa refusal to admit the allegations is
equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies

contains no admission of the allegations, without also stating that Defendant does not deny the
allegations; and (iii) upon the filing of this Consent, Defendant hereby withdraws any papers
filed in this action to the extent that they deny any allegation in the complaint. [f Defendant
breaches this agreement, the Commission may petition the Court to vacate the Final Judgment

UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
","Press Release

SEC Charges Hitachi With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2015-212

Washington D.C., Sept. 28, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Tokyo-based conglomerate Hitachi, Ltd. with
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when it inaccurately recorded improper payments to South Africaâs ruling political party in
connection with contracts to build two multi-billion dollar power plants.

Hitachi has agreed to pay $19 million to settle the SEC charges.

The SEC alleges that Hitachi sold a 25-percent stake in a South African subsidiary to a company serving as a front for the African National
Congress (ANC). This arrangement gave the front company and the ANC the ability to share in the profits from any power station contracts
that Hitachi secured. Hitachi was ultimately awarded two contracts to build power stations in South Africa and paid the ANCâs front company
approximately $5 million in âdividendsâ based on profits derived from the contracts. Through a separate, undisclosed arrangement, Hitachi
paid the front company an additional $1 million in âsuccess feesâ that were inaccurately booked as consulting fees without appropriate
documentation.

âHitachi's lax internal control environment enabled its subsidiary to pay millions of dollars to a politically-connected front company for the
ANC to win contracts with the South African government,â said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SECâs Enforcement Division. âHitachi then
unlawfully mischaracterized those payments in its books and records as consulting fees and other legitimate payments.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia:

e Hitachi was aware that Chancellor House Holdings (Pty) Ltd. was a funding vehicle for the ANC during the bidding process.

e Hitachi nevertheless continued to partner with Chancellor and encourage the company to use its political influence to help obtain
government contracts from Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., a public utility owned and operated by the South African government.

e Hitachi paid âsuccess feesâ to Chancellor for its exertion of influence during the Eskom tender process pursuant to a separate, unsigned
side-arrangement.

Hitachiâs misconduct violated the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically
Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Hitachi agreed to a settlement that would require the company to pay a $19 million
penalty, and it would be permanently enjoined from future violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Jon Jordan and Thierry Olivier Desmet of the FCPA Unit in Miami with assistance from Kathleen
Strandell, David S. Johnson, and Matthew P. Cohen. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department of the African Development Bank, and the South African
Financial Services Board.

âWe particularly appreciate the assistance we received from the African Development Bankâs Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department and
hope this is the first in a series of collaborations,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

In the Matter of ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
COMPANY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I,

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (âBMSâ or
Respondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferââ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderââ), as set forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

SUMMARY

These proceedings arise out of violations of the internal controls and recordkeeping
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the âFCPAâ) by BMS and its majority-owned joint
venture in China. Between 2009 and 2014, BMS failed to design and maintain effective internal
controls relating to interactions with health care providers (âHCPsâ) at state-owned and state-
controlled hospitals in China. Through various mechanisms during this period, certain sales
representatives of the joint venture improperly generated funds that were used to provide corrupt
inducements to HCPs in the form of cash payments, gifts, meals, travel, entertainment, and
sponsorships for conferences and meetings in order to secure new sales and increase existing sales.
BMS falsely recorded the relevant transactions as legitimate business expenses in its books and
records.

RESPONDENT

1. BMS, a Delaware corporation based in New York, NY, develops, licenses,
manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells pharmaceutical and over-the-counter products on a
worldwide basis. The common stock of BMS is registered with the Commission under Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act and its convertible preferred stock is registered with the Commission
under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The common stock of BMS trades on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol BMY.

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

2. Bristol-Myers Squibb (China) Investment Co. Limited (âBMS Chinaâ) is a
company through which BMS conducts business in China. BMS China, in turn, primarily operates
through Sino-American Shanghai Squibb Pharmaceuticals Limited (âSASSâ), a majority-owned
joint venture. BMS holds a 60% equity interest in SASS and has held operational control over this
entity since 2009 when it obtained the right to name the President of SASS and a majority of the
members of SASSâs Board of Directors.

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
FACTS

3. BMS began operating in China in 1982 when it formed SASS, the first Sino-
American pharmaceutical joint venture. Following a successful product launch in 2005, BMS
Chinaâs business grew quickly. By 2009, BMS China had 1490 full-time employees and net sales
of more than $200 million. This upward trend continued through 2014 when the number of full-
time employees expanded to 2464 and net sales reached nearly $500 million.

4. Certain BMS China employees achieved their sales, in part, by providing HCPs and
other government officials with cash and other inducements in exchange for prescriptions and drug
listings.

Failure to Respond to Red Flags

5. BMS China failed to respond effectively to red flags indicating that sales personnel
provided improper payments and other benefits in order to generate sales from HCPs. In 2009,
BMS China initiated a review of travel and entertainment expenses submitted for reimbursement
by its sales personnel and found non-compliant claims, fake and altered invoices and receipts, and
consecutively numbered receipts. Shortly thereafter, BMS China retained a local accounting firm
to conduct monthly post-payment reviews of all claims for travel, entertainment, and meeting
expenses to identify false, improperly documented, and unsubstantiated claims. BMS China
brought this function in-house in early 2011 and the results of both the external and internal
reviews were provided to management of BMS China as well as regional compliance and
corporate business managers who reported directly to senior management of BMS.

6. During the period between mid-2009 and late 2013, BMS China identified
numerous irregularities in travel and entertainment and event documentation, including fake and
altered purchase orders, invoices, agendas, and attendance sheets for meetings with HCPs that
likely had not occurred. BMS China inaccurately recorded the reimbursement of these false claims

as legitimate business expenses in its books and records, which were then consolidated into the
books and records of BMS.

7. Certain BMS China employees admitted that they had submitted false
reimbursement claims and used the funds for the benefit of HCPs in support of sales by BMS
China. They also alleged that the use of false rermbursement claims to fund payments to and for
the benefit of HCPs in order to secure prescription sales was a widespread practice at BMS China.
In emails to the BMS China President in November 2010 and January 2011, certain terminated
employees wrote that they used the funds to pay rebates, provide entertainment, and fund gift cards
for HCPs, as there was no other way to meet their sales targets. Citing the âopen secretâ that HCPs
in China rely upon the âgray incomeâ to maintain their livelihood, they said that they tried to meet
the demands of the HCPs for the benefit of BMS China. Despite the widespread exceptions and
serious allegations of potentially widespread bribery practices, BMS China did not investigate
these claims.
Compliance and Controls Environment

8. Despite its longstanding presence in China, BMS did not implement a formal FCPA
compliance program until April 2006 when it adopted its first standalone anti-bribery policy and
corresponding corporative directive. At approximately the same time, BMS began conducting
compliance assessments and audits of BMS China that included a review of internal controls
relating to anti-bribery risks. These internal reviews revealed weaknesses in the monitoring of
payments made to HCPs, the lack of formal processes around the selection and compensation of
HCPs as speakers, deficiencies in obtaining and documenting the approval of donations,
sponsorships, and consulting arrangements with HCPs, and the failure to conduct post-event
verification of meetings and conferences sponsored by sales representatives. Reports of these
findings were provided to senior management of BMS China as well as members of BMSâs global
compliance department.

9. These identified controls deficiencies were not timely remediated and compliance
resources were minimal. The corporate compliance officer responsible for the Asia-Pacific region
through 2012 was based in the U.S. and rarely traveled to China. There was no dedicated
compliance officer for BMS China until 2008, and no permanent compliance position in China
until 2010. In addition, the BMS sales force in China received limited training and much of it was
inaccessible to a large number of sales representatives who worked in remote locations. For
example, when BMS rolled out mandatory anti-bribery training in late 2009, 67% of employees in
China failed to complete the training by the due date.

10. Annual internal audits of BMS China repeatedly identified substantial gaps in
internal controls, and the results were reported to the Audit Committee and senior management of
BMS. In connection with each audit, the audit team cited a lack of effective controls and
documentation relating to interactions with HCPs and the monitoring of potential inappropriate
payments to HCPs. Among Internal Auditâs conclusions were that BMS Chinaâs controls around
the review and approval of travel and entertainment expenses and gifts to HCPs were not effective
and that it failed to track payments to HCPs, including high-risk payments, in its quarterly review
of potential inappropriate payments, and to enforce controls relating to the documentation,
approval, and payment of distributor rebates. Internal Audit also cited the lack of due diligence
assessments of distributor compliance, including anti-bribery compliance, the failure to properly
document and approve agreements with HCPs who served as speakers, and the lack of a
mechanism to ensure that services were received in exchange for sponsorships. As a result,
Internal Audit issued a series of qualified opinions in connection with its annual audits of BMS
China between 2009 and 2013.

Internal Documents Reveal Improper Benefits Provided to HCPs

11. Emails and other BMS China documents detail, among other things, proposed
âactivity plans,â âaction plans,â and plans for âinvestmentsâ in HCPs to increase prescription sales.
These contemporaneous documents were prepared at the direction of, and sometimes transmitted
to, district and regional sales managers of BMS China, and show that sales representatives used
funds derived from travel and expense claims to make cash payments to HCPs and to provide gifts,

4
meals, entertainment, and travel to HCPs in order to induce them to prescribe products sold and
marketed by BMS China. The sales representatives provided a variety of benefits to HCPs,
ranging from small food and personal care items to shopping cards, jewelry, sightseeing, and cash
payments, in exchange for prescription sales. This kind of conduct was captured in a July 2013
email from a sales representative to a regional manager. The sales representative explained that a
former sales representative had offered cash for sales to HCPs at a local hospital and âthe attitude
of the director of the infectious diseases department was extremely clear when I took over: âNo
money, no prescription.ââ Similarly, the work plans prepared by other sales representatives also
identified correlations between the value of the benefits provided to specific HCPs and the volume
of prescription sales expected.

12. Certain documents within BMS China were replete with references to
âinvestmentsâ made in order to obtain sales, such as offering speaking engagements and
sponsorships for domestic and international conferences and meetings in exchange for
prescriptions. Some sales representatives also sought to increase prescription sales and maintain
drug listings at pharmacies by hosting cash promotions and events for pharmacy employees.
Based on the volume of prescriptions, certain BMS China sales representatives gave cash,
shopping cards, and foodstuffs as promotional prizes to pharmacy employees; at least one sales
representative characterized the expenses as a âdepartmental development feeâ in
contemporaneous documents.

LEGAL STANDARDS

13. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder or any other person that is, was, or would
be a cause of the violation due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such violation.

Violations of the Recordkeeping and Internal Controls Provisions of the FCPA

 

14. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and Keep books,
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
disposition of the assets of the issuer. 15 U.S.C. Â§78m(b)(2)(A).

15. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to devise and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (1)
transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B).

16. As described herein, BMS, through the actions of certain BMS China employees,
violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by falsely recording, as advertising and
promotional expenses, cash payments and expenses for gifts, meals, travel, entertainment, speaker
fees, and sponsorships for conferences and meetings provided to foreign officials, such as HCPs at
state-owned and state-controlled hospitals as well as employees of state-owned pharmacies in
China, to secure prescription sales. BMS also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by
failing to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls relating to payments and
benefits provided by sales representatives at BMS China to these foreign officials. As identified in
various internal reviews, audits, and investigations conducted since at least 2009, BMS lacked
effective internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that funds advanced and
reimbursed to employees of BMS China were used for appropriate and authorized purposes.

REMEDIAL EFFORTS

17. BMS has implemented significant measures to enhance its anti-bribery and general
compliance training and policies and to strengthen its accounting and monitoring controls relating
to interactions with HCPs, including travel and entertainment expenses, meetings, sponsorships,
grants, and donations funded by BMS China. BMS took numerous steps to improve the internal
controls and compliance program at BMS China. Examples include a 100% pre-reimbursement
review of all expense claims; the implementation of an accounting system designed to track each
expense claim, including the request, approval, and payment of each claim; and the retention of a
third-party vendor to conduct surprise checks at events sponsored by sales representatives.
Additionally, BMS terminated over ninety employees, and disciplined an additional ninety
employees, including sales representatives and managers of BMS China, who failed to comply
with or sufficiently supervise compliance with relevant policies. In addition, BMS replaced certain
BMS China officers as part of an overall effort to enhance âtone at the topâ and a culture of
compliance. Further, BMS revised the compensation structure for BMS China employees by
reducing the portion of incentive-based compensation for sales and distribution, eliminated gifts to
HCPs, implemented enhanced due diligence procedures for third-party agents, implemented
monitoring systems for speaker fees and third-party events, and incorporated risk assessments
based on data analytics into its compliance program.
IV.

agreed to in Respondent BMSâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Bristol-Myers Squibb

SEC Charges Bristol-Myers Squibb With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2015-229

Washington D.C., Oct. 5, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that New York-based pharmaceutical company
Bristol-Myers Squibb has agreed to settle charges that its joint venture in China made cash payments and provided other benefits to health
care providers at state-owned and state-controlled hospitals in exchange for prescription sales.

Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay more than $14 million to settle the SECâs finding that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and
reaped more than $11 million in profits from its misconduct.

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Bristol-Myers Squibb lacked effective internal controls over
interactions with health care providers at BMS China, its majority-owned joint venture. Between 2009 and 2014, BMS China sales
representatives sought to secure and increase business by providing health care providers in China with cash, jewelry and other gifts, meals,
travel, entertainment, and sponsorships for conferences and meetings. BMS China inaccurately recorded the spending as legitimate business
expenses in its books and records, which were then consolidated into the books and records of Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Among the findings in the SECâs order:

e Bristol-Myers Squibb failed to respond effectively to red flags indicating that sales personnel provided bribes and other benefits to
generate sales from health care providers in China.

e Bristol-Myers Squibb did not investigate claims by certain terminated employees of BMS China that faked invoices, receipts, and
purchase orders were widely used to fund improper payments to health care providers.

e Bristol-Myers Squibb was slow to remediate gaps in internal controls over interactions with health care providers and monitor potential
inappropriate payments to them that were identified repeatedly in annual internal audits of BMS China between 2009 and 2013.

âBristol-Myers Squibbâs failure to institute an effective internal controls system and to respond promptly to indications of significant
compliance gaps at its Chinese joint venture enabled a widespread practice of providing corrupt inducements in exchange for prescription
sales to continue for years,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

The SECâs order finds that Bristol-Myers Squibb violated the FCPAâs internal controls and recordkeeping provisions. Without admitting or
denying the findings, Bristol-Myers Squibb consented to the order and agreed to return $11.4 million of profits plus prejudgment interest of
$500,000 and pay a civil penalty of $2.75 million. Bristol-Myers Squibb also agreed to report to the SEC for a two-year period on the status of
its remediation and implementation of FCPA and anti-corruption compliance measures.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I,

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) against The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company
(âGoodyearâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Making Findings, and
Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderââ), as set forth below.
TI.
On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds' that:
Summary

1. This case involves violations of the books, records, and internal control provisions of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by Goodyear. Goodyear, headquartered in Akron,
Ohio, is one of the worldâs largest tire companies. From 2007 through 2011, Goodyear
subsidiaries in Kenya (Treadsetters Tyres Ltd., or âTreadsettersâ) and Angola (Trentyre Angola
Lda., or âTrentyreâ) routinely paid bribes to employees of government-owned entities and
private companies to obtain tire sales. These same subsidiaries also paid bribes to police, tax,
and other local authorities. In all, between 2007 and 2011, Goodyear subsidiaries in Kenya and
Angola made over $3.2 million in illicit payments.

2. All of these bribery payments were falsely recorded as legitimate business expenses
in the books and records of these subsidiaries which were consolidated into Goodyearâs books and
records. Goodyear did not prevent or detect these improper payments because it failed to
implement adequate FCPA compliance controls at its subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Respondent

3. Goodyear, an Ohio corporation headquartered in Akron, Ohio, is one of the
worldâs largest tire manufacturers. Goodyear has manufacturing facilities in 22 countries and sells
tires in most countries around the world. Goodyearâs common stock is registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on The NASDAQ Stock
Market.

Other Relevant Entities

4. Magister Ltd. (âMagisterâ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goodyear
incorporated in Mauritius, and headquartered in South Africa. Magister holds the shares and
oversees the operations of the Goodyear subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa. During the relevant
time period this included Treadsetters in Kenya and Trentyre in Angola.

5. Treadsetters is a retail tire distributor incorporated and located in Kenya. During
the relevant time period, Treadsetters was an indirect subsidiary of Goodyear, and had annual
revenues of approximately $20 million. Goodyear divested its ownership interest in Treadsetters
in 2013.

6. Trentyre is a retail tire distributor incorporated and located in Angola. Trentyre
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Goodyear. During the relevant time period, Trentyre had
annual revenues between $6 million and $20 million.

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Improper Payments in Kenya

7. Treadsetters is a retail tire distributor in Kenya. In 2002, Goodyear acquired a
minority ownership interest in Treadsetters. By 2006, Goodyear had acquired a majority ownership
interest in the company, though the day-to-day operations of Treadsetters continued to be run by
Treadsettersâ founders and the local general manager. During the relevant time period, Treadsetters
had annual revenues of approximately $20 million.

8. From 2007 through 2011, Treadsettersâ management regularly authorized and paid
bribes to employees of government-owned or affiliated entities, and private companies, to obtain
business. The practice was routine and appears to have been in place prior to Goodyearâs
acquisition of Treadsetters. The bribes generally were paid in cash and falsely recorded on
Treadsettersâ books as expenses for promotional products.

9. Treadsettersâ general manager and finance director were at the center of the
scheme. They approved payments for phony promotional products, and then directed the finance
assistant to write-out the checks to cash. Treadsettersâ staff then cashed the checks and used the
money to make improper payments to employees of customers, which included both government-
owned entities and private companies.

10. Between 2007 and 2011, Treadsetters paid over $1.5 million in bribes in connection
with the sale of tires. This included improper payments to employees of government-owned or
affiliated entities including the Kenya Ports Authority, the Armed Forces Canteen Organization,
the Nzoia Sugar Company, the Kenyan Air Force, the Ministry of Roads, the Ministry of State for
Defense, the East African Portland Cement Co., and Telkom Kenya Ltd. During that same time
period, Treadsetters also made approximately $14,457 in improper payments to local government
officials in Kenya, including city council employees, police, and building inspectors.

11. Goodyear did not detect or prevent these improper payments because it failed to
conduct adequate due diligence when it acquired Treadsetters, and failed to implement adequate
FCPA compliance training and controls after the acquisition.

Improper Payments in Angola

12. Trentyre was incorporated in 2007, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goodyear.
Trentyre is primarily engaged in selling new tires for mining equipment. During the relevant time
period, Trentyre had annual revenues between $6 million and $20 million.

13. From 2007 through 2011, Trentyre paid over $1.6 million in bribes to employees of
government-owned or affiliated entities, and private companies, to obtain tire sales. Trentyre paid
approximately $1.4 million of these bribes to employees of government-owned or affiliated
entities in Angola, including the Catoca Diamond Mine, UNICARGAS, Engevia Construction
and Public Works, the Electric Company of Luanda, National Service of Alfadega, and Sonangol.
A majority of these improper payments were paid to employees of Trentyreâs largest customer at
the time, the Catoca Diamond Mine, which is owned by a consortium of mining interests,
including Endiama E.P., Angolaâs national mining company, and ALROSA, a Russian mining
company. During the same time period, Trentyre also made approximately $64,713 in improper
payments to local government officials in Angola, including police and tax authorities.

14. The bribery scheme was put in place by Trentyreâs former general manager. To
hide the scheme and generate funds for the improper payments, Trentyre falsely marked-up the
costs of its tires by adding to its invoice price phony freight and customs clearing costs. On a
monthly basis, as tires were sold, the phony freight and clearing costs were reclassified to a
balance sheet account. Trentyre made improper payments to employees of customers both in cash
and through wire transfers. As bribes were paid, the amounts were debited from the balance sheet
account, and falsely recorded as payments to vendors for freight and clearing costs.

15. Goodyear did not prevent or detect these improper payments because it failed to
implement adequate FCPA compliance training and controls at this subsidiary.

Legal Standards and Violations

16. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was, or
would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known
would contribute to such violation.

17. Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. Â§78m(b)(2)(A)].

18. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(1) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization;
(11) transactions are recorded as necessary (1) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C. Â§78m(b)(2)(B)].

19. As described above, Goodyear subsidiaries in Kenya and Angola made improper
payments to employees of government-owned entities and private companies to obtain business.
These improper payments were falsely recorded as legitimate business expenses in the books and
records of these subsidiaries which were consolidated into Goodyearâs books and records.
Accordingly, Goodyear violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. As described above,
Goodyear also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to devise and maintain
sufficient accounting controls to prevent and detect these improper payments.
Goodyearâs Cooperation and Remedial Efforts

20. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. After
receiving information about the bribes, Goodyear promptly halted the improper payments and
reported the matter to Commission staff. Goodyear also provided significant cooperation with the
Commissionâs investigation. This included voluntarily producing documents and reports and other
information from the companyâs internal investigation, and promptly responding to Commission
staffs requests for information and documents. These efforts assisted the Commission in efficiently
collecting evidence including information that may not have been otherwise available to the staff.

21. Goodyear also has undertaken remedial efforts. In Kenya, Goodyear divested its
ownership interest in Treadsetters, and ceased all business dealings with the company. In Angola,
after Goodyear halted the improper payments its subsidiary lost its largest customer. Goodyear is
now in the process of divesting this subsidiary.

22. Goodyear also undertook disciplinary action against certain employees, including
executives of its Europe, Middle East and Africa region who had oversight responsibility, for
failing to ensure adequate FCPA compliance training and controls were in place at the companyâs
subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa.

23. Goodyear also implemented improvements to its compliance program, both specific
to its operations in sub-Saharan Africa, and globally. In Africa, the improvements include
expanded on-line and in-person anti-corruption training for subsidiary management, sales, and
finance personnel; regular audits, by internal audit, specifically focused on corruption risks;
quarterly self-assessment questionnaires required of each subsidiary regarding business with
government-affiliated customers; quarterly management certifications from every subsidiary that
cover among other things controls over financial reporting; and annual testing of internal controls
at each subsidiary. To increase oversight, Goodyear also put in place a new regional management
structure, and added new compliance, accounting, and audit positions. Goodyear is also making
technology improvements, where possible, to electronically link subsidiaries in sub-Saharan
Africa to its global network. At the parent company, Goodyear created a new senior position of
Vice President of Compliance and Ethics, which further elevated the compliance function within
the company. Goodyear has also expanded on-line and in-person anti-corruption and ethics
training at its other subsidiaries, and implemented a new Integrity Hotline Web Portal, which
enhanced usersâ ability to file anonymous online reports to its hotline system. With that system,
Goodyear is also implementing a new case management system for legal, compliance and internal
audit to document and track complaints, investigations and remediation. Goodyear also has
updated its policies governing third-party agents and vendors, and is in the process of
implementing a new third-party due diligence software tool.
IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in the Respondent Goodyearâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Goodyear cease and
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of
Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

B. Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of
$14,122,525 and prejudgment interest of $2,105,540 to the United States Treasury.
If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule
of Practice 600. Payments must be made in one of the following ways:

1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
shall provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United
States postal money order, payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Goodyear as the Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy
of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Brian O. Quinn, Assistant Director,
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington,
DC 20549.

C. Respondent shall report to the Commission staff periodically, at no less than twelve-
month intervals during a three-year term, the status of its remediation and
implementation of compliance measures. Should respondent discover credible
evidence, not already reported to the Commission staff, that questionable or corrupt
payments or questionable or corrupt transfers of property or interests may have been
offered, promised, paid, or authorized by Respondent entity or person, or any entity
or person while working directly for Respondent, or that related false books and
records have been maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to the
Commission staff. During this three-year period, Respondent shall: (1) conduct an
initial review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two
(2) follow-up reviews and reports, as described below:

1) Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a written report within one
(1) year of the entry of this Order setting forth a complete description of its
FCPA and anti-corruption related remediation efforts to date, its proposals
reasonably designed to improve the policies and procedures of Respondent
for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption
laws, and the parameters of the subsequent reviews (the âInitial Reportâ).
The Initial Report shall be transmitted to Brian O. Quinn, Assistant Director,
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F
Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Respondent may extend the time
period for issuance of the Initial Report with prior written approval of the
Commission staff.

2) Respondent shall undertake at least two (2) follow-up reviews, incorporating
any comments provided by the Commission staff on the previous report, to
further monitor and assess whether the policies and procedures of
Respondent are reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the
FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws (the âFollow-up Reportsâ).

3) The first Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later than one (1) year
after the Initial Report. The second Follow-up Report shall be completed by
no later than one (1) year after the completion of the first Follow-up Report.
Respondent may extend the time period for issuance of the Follow-up
Reports with prior written approval of the Commission staff.

4) The periodic reviews and reports submitted by Respondent will likely
include proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive business
information. Public disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation,
impede pending or potential government investigations or undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the
reports and the contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-
public, except (1) pursuant to court order, (2) as agreed by the parties in
writing, (3) to the extent that the Commission staff determines in its sole
discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commissionâs
discharge of its duties and responsibilities, or (4) is otherwise required by
law.

Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty
based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation and related
enforcement action. If at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division
of Enforcement (âDivisionâ) obtains information indicating that Respondent
knowingly provided materially false or misleading information or materials to the
Commission or in a related proceeding, the Division may, at its sole discretion
and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to reopen this
matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay a civil money penalty.
Respondent may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative
proceeding whether it knowingly provided materially false or misleading
information, but may not: (1) contest the findings in the Order; or (2) assert any
defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to any statute of
limitations defense.

SEC Charges Goodyear With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2015-38

Washington D.C., Feb. 24, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company with violating
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries paid bribes to land tire sales in Kenya and Angola.

Goodyear agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle the SECâs charges.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, Goodyear failed to prevent or detect more than $3.2 million in
bribes during a four-year period due to inadequate FCPA compliance controls at its subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa. Bribes were generally
paid in cash to employees of private companies or government-owned entities as well as other local authorities such as police or city council
officials. The improper payments were falsely recorded as legitimate business expenses in the books and records of the subsidiaries, which
were consolidated into Goodyearâs books and records.

âPublic companies must keep accurate accounting records, and Goodyearâs lax compliance controls enabled a routine of corrupt payments by
African subsidiaries that were hidden in their books,â said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SECâs Enforcement Division. âThis
settlement ensures that Goodyear must forfeit all of the illicit profits from business obtained through bribes to foreign officials as well as
employees at commercial companies in Angola and Kenya.â

The SECâs order finds that Goodyearâs subsidiary in Kenya bribed employees of the Kenya Ports Authority, Armed Forces Canteen
Organization, Nzoia Sugar Company, Kenyan Air Force, Ministry of Roads, Ministry of State for Defense, East African Portland Cement Co., and
Telkom Kenya Ltd. Goodyearâs subsidiary in Angola bribed employees of the Catoca Diamond Mine, which is owned by a consortium of
mining interests including Angolaâs national mining company Endiama E.P. and Russian mining company ALROSA. Others bribed in Angola
worked at UNICARGAS, Engevia Construction and Public Works, Electric Company of Luanda, National Service of Alfadega, and Sonangol.

The SECâs order finds that Goodyear violated the books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws: Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Goodyear neither admitted nor denied the SECâs findings. The
settlement reflects the companyâs self-reporting, prompt remedial acts, and significant cooperation with the SECâs investigation. Goodyear
must pay disgorgement of $14,122,525 - which comprises the companyâs illicit profits in Kenya and Angola - plus prejudgment interest of
$2,105,540. Goodyear also must report its FCPA remediation efforts to the SEC for a three-year period.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Devon A. Brown and Brian T. Fitzsimons, and the case was supervised by Brian O. Quinn. The SEC
thanks the Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-

In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
FLIR SYSTEMS, INC., EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate
that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against FLIR Systems, Inc.
(âFLIRâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted
an Offer of Settlement (the âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting
or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the
subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in
Section V, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and
internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by FLIR. In
2009, employees of FLIR provided unlawful travel, gifts and entertainment to foreign
officials in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to obtain or retain business. The travel and gifts
included personal travel and expensive watches provided by employees in FLIRâs Dubai
office to government officials with the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Interior (the âMOTIâ). The
extent and nature of the travel and the value of the gifts were concealed by certain FLIR
employees and, as a result, were falsely recorded in FLIRâs books and records. FLIR

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
lacked sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent the improper travel and gifts. Also,
from 2008 through 2010, FLIR provided significant additional travel to the same MOI
officials, which was booked as business expenses, but for which there is insufficient
supporting documentation to confirm the business purpose. As a result of the unlawful
conduct, FLIR earned over $7 million in profits from the sales to the MOI.

Respondent

2. FLIR Systems, Inc. is an Oregon-based corporation whose common stock
is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market. FLIR, founded in 1978, develops infrared technology for use in thermal
imaging and other sensing products and systems, night vision, and camera systems for
government and commercial customers. On September 30, 2002, in connection with a
settled accounting fraud case, the Commission ordered FLIR to cease and desist from
violations of the anti-fraud and related provisions of the federal securities laws.

FLIRâs Business with the Saudi Ministry of Interior

3. Stephen Timms (âTimmsâ) was the head of FLIRâs Middle East office in
Dubai during the relevant time period, and was one of the company executives responsible
for obtaining business for FLIRâs Government Systems division from the MOI. Yasser
Ramahi (âRamahiâ) reported to Timms and worked in business development in Dubai.â
Both Timms and Ramahi were employees of FLIR.

4. In November 2008, FLIR entered into a contract with the MOT to sell
binoculars using infrared technology for approximately $12.9 million. Ramahi and Timms
were the primary sales employees responsible for the contract on behalf of FLIR. In the
contract, FLIR agreed to conduct a âFactory Acceptance Test,â attended by MOI officials,
prior to delivery of the binoculars to Saudi Arabia. The Factory Acceptance Test was a key
condition to the fulfillment of the contract. FLIR anticipated that a successful delivery of

the binoculars, along with the creation of a FLIR service center, would lead to an additional
order in 2009 or 2010.Â°

âWorld Tourâ

5. In February 2009, Ramahi and Timms began preparing for the July 2009
Factory Acceptance Test. Ramahi and Timms then made arrangements to send MOI
officials on what Timms later referred to as a âworld tourâ before and after the Factory
Acceptance Test. Among the MOI officials for whom Ramahi and Timms provided the
âworld tourâ were the head of the MOIâs technical committee and a senior engineer on the
committee, who played a key role in the decision to award FLIR the business.

6. The trip proceeded as planned, with stops in Casablanca, Paris, Dubai and
Beirut. While in the Boston area, the MOI officials spent a single 5-hour day at FLIRâs

 

Â° On November 17, 2014, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings

against Timms and Ramahi for their role in this same conduct.
Â° At the same time, Ramahi and Timms were also involved in FLIRâs negotiations to sell
security cameras to the MOI. In May 2009, FLIR signed an agreement for the integration of its
cameras into another companyâs products for use by the MOI. The contract was valued at
approximately $17.4 million and FLIR hoped to win additional future business with the MOI
under this agreement.
Boston facility completing the equipment inspection. The agenda for their remaining seven
days in Boston included just three other 1-2 hour visits to FLIRâs Boston facility, some
additional meetings with FLIR personnel, at their hotel, and other leisure activities, all at
FLIRâs expense. At the suggestion of Timmsâ manager, a U.S.-based Vice President
responsible for global sales to foreign governments, Ramahi also took the MOI on a
weekend trip to New York while they were in Boston. In total, the MOI officials traveled
for 20 nights on their âworld tour,â with airfare and luxury hotel accommodations paid by
FLIR. There was no business purpose for the stops outside of Boston.

7. Timms forwarded the air travel expenses for the MOI to his manager for
approval, attaching a summary reflecting the full extended routing of the travel. The
manager approved the travel, directing him to make the expenses appear smaller by
âbreak[ing] it in 2 [submissions.]â Timms also forwarded the travel charges and an
itinerary showing the Paris and Beirut stops, to FLIRâs finance department. FLIRâs finance
department processed and paid the approved air expenses the next day. Neither Timmsâ
manager nor anyone in FLIRâs finance department questioned the itinerary or the travel
expense, although the itinerary reflected travel to locations other than Boston.

8. After receiving questions from Timmsâ manager, Ramahi and Timms later
claimed that the MOIâs âworld tourâ had been a mistake. They told the FLIR finance
department that the MOI had used FLIRâs travel agent in Dubai to book their own travel
and that it had been mistakenly charged to FLIR. They then used FLIRâs third-party agent
to give the appearance that the MOI paid for their travel. Timms also oversaw the
preparation of false and misleading documentation of the MOI travel expenses that was
submitted to FLIR finance as the âcorrectedâ travel documentation. FLIR finance then
made an additional payment to the Dubai travel agency for the remaining travel costs.

9. Following the equipment inspection in Boston, the MOI gave its permission
for FLIR to ship the binoculars. The MOI later placed an order for additional binoculars
for an approximate price of $1.2 million. In total, FLIR earned revenues of over $7 million
in profits in connection with its sales of binoculars to the MOI.

Additional Travel

10. From 2008 through 2010, FLIR paid approximately $40,000 for additional
travel by MOI officials. For example, Ramahi took the same MOI officials who went on
the âworld tourâ to Dubai over the New Year holiday in December 2008 and again in 2009.
FLIR paid for airfare, hotel, and expensive dinners and drinks. FLIR also paid for hotels,
meals and first class flights for the MOI officials to travel within Saudi Arabia to help FLIR
win business with other Saudi government agencies. Although the trips were booked as
business expenses, the supporting documentation is incomplete and it is not possible to
determine whether all the trips in fact had a business purpose.

11. Moreover, in June and July of 2011, a FLIR regional sales manager
accompanied nine officials from the Egyptian Ministry of Defense on travel paid for by a
FLIR partner. The travel centered on a legitimate Factory Acceptance Test at FLIRâs
Stockholm factory. The travel, however, also included a non-essential visit to Paris, during
which the officials spent only two days on demonstration and promotion activities relating
to FLIR products. In total, the government officials traveled for 14 days and most of the
officials only participated in legitimate business activities on four of those days. Three
officials engaged in two additional days of training in Sweden. The total travel costs were
approximately $43,000. FLIR subsequently reimbursed the partner for the majority of the
travel costs, based upon cursory invoices which were submitted without supporting
documentation.
Expensive Watches

12. At Timmsâ and Ramahiâs instruction, in February 2009, FLIRâs third-party
agent purchased five watches in Riyadh, paying approximately 26,000 Saudi Riyal (about
U.S. $7,000). Ramahi and Timms gave the watches to MOI officials during a mid-March
2009 trip to Saudi Arabia to discuss several business opportunities with the MOI. The
MOI officials who received the watches included two of the MOI officials who
subsequently went on the âworld tourâ travel.

13. Within weeks of his visit to Saudi Arabia, Timms submitted an expense
report to FLIR for retrmbursement of the watches. The expense report clearly identified the
watches as âEXECUTIVE GIFTS: 5 WATCHESâ costing $1,425 each. Shortly
thereafter, Timms specified that the watches were given to MOI officials, and identified the
specific officials who received the watches.

14. Despite these red flags, the reambursement was approved by Timmsâ
manager and, based on that approval and the submitted invoices, FLIRâs finance
department paid the reimbursement to Timms.

15. In July 2009, in connection with an unrelated review of expenses in the
Dubai office, FLIRâs finance department flagged Timmsâ reimbursement request for the
watches. In response to their questions, Timms claimed that he had made a mistake and
falsely stated that the expense report should have reflected a total of 7,000 Saudi Riyal
(about $1,900) for the watches, rather than $7,000 as submitted. Ramahi also told FLIR
investigators that the watches were each purchased for approximately 1,300-1,400 Saudi
Riyal (approximately $377) by FLIRâs third-party agent. In September 2009, at Timmsâ
direction, FLIRâs agent maintained the false cover story in response to emailed questions
from FLIRâs finance department. Timms and Ramahi also obtained a false invoice
reflecting that the watches cost 7,000 Saudi Riyal, which Timms submitted to FLIR finance
in August 2009. The false, revised invoice was processed by FLIR.

FLIRâs FCPA-Related Policies and Training and Internal Controls

16. During the relevant time, FLIR had a code of conduct, as well as a specific
anti-bribery policy, which prohibited FLIR employees from violating the FCPA. FLIRâs
policies required employees to record information âaccurately and honestlyâ in FLIRâs
books and records, with âno materiality requirement or threshold for a violation.â FLIR
employees, including Timms and Ramahi, received training on their obligations under the
FCPA and FLIRâs policy, although the company did not ensure that all employees,
including Ramahi, completed the required training.

17. FLIR had few internal controls over travel in its foreign sales offices at the
time. Although FLIR had policies and procedures over travel for its domestic operations,
there were no controls or policies in place governing the use of foreign travel agencies.
Instead, FLIR foreign sales employees worked directly with FLIRâs foreign travel agencies
to arrange travel for themselves and others. Sales managers, such as Timms, were solely
responsible for expense approvals for their sales staff. Timmsâ manager was responsible
for approving travel-related expenses for all non-U.S.-based senior sales employees (such
as Timms) and approving the payment of large invoices to the foreign travel agencies.

18. FLIR also had few controls over the giving of gifts to customers, including
foreign government officials. Sales staff and managers were responsible for all expense
approvals for gifts and accounts payable was not trained to flag expenses that were
potentially problematic. To the contrary, the initial expense submission for the watches
was labeled in large English print âEXECUTIVE GIFTS: 5 WATCHESâ for a total of
$7,123, and was accompanied by email confirmation that the watches were provided to 5
MOI âofficers,â when it was approved by Timmsâ manager and processed and paid by
FLIR accounts payable department.

Remedial Efforts

19. In November 2010, FLIR received a complaint letter from FLIRâs third-
party agent, and began an investigation that lead to the discovery of the improper watches
and travel. FLIR subsequently self-reported the conduct to the Commission and cooperated
with the Commissionâs investigation.

20. Subsequent to the conduct described herein, FLIR undertook significant
remedial efforts including personnel and vendor terminations. FLIR broadened its relevant
policies and trainings and implemented a gift policy. FLIR enhanced access by its
employees to its anti-bribery policy by providing translations into languages spoken in all
countries in which it has offices. FLIR is in the process of enhancing its travel approval
system in its foreign offices, including requiring all non-employee travel to be booked
through either one large, designated travel agency or a limited number of designated
regional travel agencies after receiving advance written approval from senior business
personnel and the legal department. All travel agencies will be vetted through FLIRâs full
FCPA due diligence framework, be subject to all of FLIRâs current FCPA training
obligations, and cannot be reimbursed for travel bookings for non-employees in the absence
of appropriate approvals. FLIR added additional FCPA training and procedures for its
finance staff, and enhanced its third-party diligence process and contracts. FLIR also
engaged outside counsel and forensic accountants to conduct a compliance review of travel
and entertainment expenses in its operations outside the U.S.

Legal Standards and FCPA Violations

21. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a
cease-and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate
any provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other
person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the
person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation.

22. Section 30A of the Exchange Act prohibits any issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or any officer, director,
employee, or agent acting on behalf of such issuer, in order to obtain or retain business,
from corruptly giving or authorizing the giving of, anything of value to any foreign official
for the purposes of influencing the official or inducing the official to act in violation of his
or her lawful duties, or to secure any improper advantage, or to induce a foreign official to
use his influence with a foreign governmental instrumentality to influence any act or
decision of such government or instrumentality. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

23. Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to
make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and

fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. Â§
78m(b)(2)(A)].

24. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that (1) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs
general or specific authorization; (11) transactions are recorded as necessary (1) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II) to maintain
accountability for assets; (111) access to assets 1s permitted only in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

25. As described above, FLIR violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act by
corruptly providing expensive gifts of travel, entertainment, and personal items to the
MOI officials to retain and obtain business for FLIR. Respondent also violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, by failing to devise and maintain a sufficient system of
internal accounting controls to prevent the provision and approval of the watches and the
travel and the falsification of FLIRâs books and records to conceal the conduct. As a result
of this same conduct, FLIR failed to make and keep accurate books and records in violation
of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the
sanctions agreed to in Respondentâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of

and records have been maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to the
Commission staff. During this two-year period, Respondent shall: (1) conduct an initial
review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two follow-up

and anti-corruption related remediation efforts to date, its proposals
reasonably designed to improve the policies and procedures of
Respondent for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws, the parameters of the subsequent

SEC Charges Oregon-Based Defense Contractor With FCPA
Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2015-62

Washington D.C., April 8, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Oregon-based FLIR Systems Inc. with violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by financing what an employee termed a âworld tourâ of personal travel for government officials in the
Middle East who played key roles in decisions to purchase FLIR products. FLIR earned more than $7 million in profits from sales influenced by
the improper travel and gifts.

FLIR, which develops infrared technology for use in binoculars and other sensing products and systems, agreed to settle the SECâs charges by
paying more than $9.5 million and reporting its FCPA compliance efforts to the agency for the next two years. The SEC previously charged
two FLIR employees in the case.

âFLIRâs deficient financial controls failed to identify and stop the activities of employees who served as de facto travel agents for influential
foreign officials to travel around the world on the companyâs dime,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against FLIR, the company had few internal controls over gifts
and travel out of its foreign sales offices. Two employees in its Dubai office provided expensive watches to government officials with the
Saudi Arabia Ministry of Interior in 2009, and they arranged for the company to pay for a 20-night excursion by Saudi officials that included
stops in Casablanca, Paris, Dubai, Beirut, and New York City. The value of the gifts and the extent and nature of the travel were falsely
recorded in FLIRâs books and records as legitimate business expenses, and the companyâs internal controls failed to catch the improper
payments despite documentation suggesting that extravagant gifts and travel were being provided.

The SECâs order finds that from 2008 to 2010, FLIR paid approximately $40,000 for additional travel by Saudi government officials, including
multiple New Yearâs Eve trips to Dubai with airfare, hotel, and expensive dinners and drinks. FLIR also accepted cursory invoices from a FLIR
company partner without any supporting documentation to pay extended travel of Egyptian officials in mid-2011.

The SECâs order finds that FLIR violated the anti-bribery provisions of Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the internal
controls and books-and-records provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. FLIR self-reported the misconduct to
the SEC and cooperated with the SECâs investigation. FLIR consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings and agreed to
pay disgorgement of $7,534,000, prejudgment interest of $970,584 and a penalty of $1 million for a total of $9,504,584.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by FCPA Unit members Cameron P. Hoffman and Tracy L. Davis in the San Francisco office. The SEC
appreciates the assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and the United Arab Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.

FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondents. AND-DESIST ORDER
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against BHP Billiton Ltd. and BHP Billiton Plc
(collectively, âBHPBâ or âRespondentsâ).

I.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the âOffersâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.

IIl.
On the basis of this Order and Respondentsâ Offers, the Commission findsâ that:

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentsâ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Summary

1. This matter concerns BHPBâs failure to devise and maintain sufficient internal
controls over a global hospitality program that the company hosted in connection with its
sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games. BHPB invited approximately 176
government officials and employees of state-owned enterprises (collectively, âgovernment
officialsâ) to attend the Olympics at BHPBâs expense. The majority of these invitations were
extended to government officials from countries in Africa and Asia that had well-known histories
of corruption. The three to four day hospitality packages included event tickets, luxury hotel
accommodations, meals, other hospitality, and, in many instances, offers of business-class airfare
for government officials and their guests. BHPB informed its employees that â[o]}ne of the core
objectives [of the Olympic sponsorship] is to maximize the commercial investment made in the
Games through assisting [BHPB] to strengthen relationships with key local and global
stakeholders, e.g.: Government Ministers, Suppliers and Customers,â and that the hospitality
program was âa primary vehicle to ensure this goal is achieved.â

2. BHPB recognized that inviting government officials to the Olympics created a
heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws and the companyâs own Guide to Business
Conduct, but the internal controls it developed and relied upon in an effort to address this risk were
insufficient. As a result, BHPB invited government officials who were directly involved in, or in a
position to influence, pending contract negotiations, efforts to obtain access rights, regulatory
actions, or business dealings affecting BHPB in multiple countries. In addition, BHPBâs books
and records, namely certain internal forms that employees prepared in order to invite a government
official to the Olympics, did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect BHPBâs pending
negotiations or business dealings with the government official at the time of the invitation.

3. As aresult of this conduct, BHPB violated the internal controls and books and
records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ).

Respondent

4. BHP Billiton (âBHPBâ) is a combination of two companies: BHP Billiton Limited,
which is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, and BHP Billiton Plc, which is headquartered in
London, England. Since 2001, BHPB has operated under a Dual Listed Company structure, under
which BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc operate as a single economic entity, run by a
unified Board of Directors and management team. BHP Billiton Limited American Depositary
Shares (ââADSsâ) and BHP Billiton Plc ADSs are registered with the Commission pursuant to
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the tickers
âBHPâ and âBBLâ respectively.

Background

5. BHPB is a global resources company that is among the worldâs leading producers
of major commodities, including iron ore, coal, oil and gas, copper, aluminum, manganese,
uranium, nickel, and silver. As of June 30, 2014, the end of its most recently completed fiscal
year, BHPB had a market capitalization of approximately $190 billion, with over 140 locations,
operations in 25 countries, and a workforce of more than 128,000 employees and contractors.

6. During the relevant period, BHPB operated through different business divisions,
called Customer Sector Groups (âCSGsâ). These CSGs included Iron Ore, Aluminium, Petroleum,
Base Metals, Diamonds and Specialty Products, Stainless Steel Materials, Manganese,
Metallurgical Coal, and Energy Coal. Each CSG had its own president, which reported to a
member of BHPBâs Group Management Committee.* BHPB also had a Minerals Exploration
Group (âMinExâ) that assisted the CSGs with exploration activities.

7. Under BHPBâs operating model during the relevant period, each CSG President
was responsible for ensuring their businessesâ compliance with the companyâs Guide to Business
Conduct. Every CSG President also was required to certify annually that they had read and
understood the Guide, confirmed that their direct reports had done the same, and discussed it with
their direct reports. BHPB had a centralized legal department. In addition, it had an advisory body
with internal and external membership called the Global Ethics Panel (âEthics Panelâ), which
advised business leaders on compliance with the Guide to Business Conduct and other business
ethics issues. BHPB did not have an independent, centralized compliance group within its legal
department, or otherwise.

BHPBâs Hospitality Program for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games
A. The Scope and Goals of BHPBâs Olympic Hospitality Program

8. In December 2005, BHPB and the Beijing Organizing Committee announced their
agreement for BHPB to become an official sponsor of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Under
this agreement, BHPB paid a sponsorship fee and supplied the raw materials used to make the
Olympic medals. In exchange, BHPB received the rights to use the Olympic trademark and other
intellectual property in public announcements and advertisements, as well as priority access to
tickets, hospitality suites, and accommodations in Beijing during the August 2008 Games.

9. BHPB established an Olympic Sponsorship Steering Committee (âOSSCâ) to plan,
oversee, and implement its sponsorship program, which involved multiple different branding,

promotion, and relationship-building initiatives. The chair of the OSSC, who also was the chair of
the Ethics Panel, reported directly to BHPBâs CEO.

10. One of BHPBâs objectives for the sponsorship was âto reinforce and develop
relationships with key stakeholdersâ in China and in âproduct and investor markets, and regions
where we have or would like to have operations.â BHPBâs strategy for accomplishing its
objectives included â[u]tiliz[ing] Olympic hospitality to motivate China-based stakeholders,
including customers, suppliers, government and media, to enhance business opportunities for BHP
Billiton in Chinaâ and â[u]tiliz[ing] Olympic hospitality to build relationships with stakeholders
from product and investor markets, and regions where we have or would like to have operations.â

11. One of the companyâs sponsorship-related initiatives was a global hospitality
program under which BHPB invited guests from around the world, including foreign government
officials and representatives of state-owned enterprises, to attend the Beijing Olympics on three to
four day hospitality packages. The hospitality packages included luxury hotel accommodations,
meals, event tickets, and sightseeing excursions, at a cost of approximately $12,000 to $16,000 per
package. In addition, BHPB executives approved the offer of round trip business class airfare to
approximately 51 foreign government officials, as well as the airfares for 35 of these government

 

? Tn 2012 and 2013, BHPB re-organized to consolidate the CSGs into five business units: Petroleum and Potash;
Copper; Iron Ore; Coal; and Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel.
officialsâ spouses or guests. Apart from BHPBâs desire to enhance business opportunities by
strengthening relationships with its guests, these trips had no other business purpose.

12. An internal e-mail to CSG presidents and other senior BHPB business managers
emphasized the importance of the hospitality program to the success of BHPBâs sponsorship,
stating, â[a]s you know we have made a commitment to support the Beijing Olympic Games in
2008. One of the core objectives is to maximise the commercial investment made in the Games
through assisting [BHPB] to strengthen relationships with key local and global stakeholders, e.g.:
Government Ministers, Suppliers and Customers. The BHP Billiton Hospitality Program is a
primary vehicle to ensure this goal is achieved.â

13. In early 2007, BHPB employees prepared country-specific Olympic Leverage
Plans, which summarized BHPBâs business and Olympic-related objectives. In a number of
instances, these plans discussed inviting key stakeholders, including government officials, to help
BHPB develop relationships with a view to increasing or maintaining its business opportunities.
For example, the Olympic Leverage Plan prepared for one country stated that BHPBâs business
objectives in that country included âgaining access to regions that will provide growth for
[BHPBâs] businessâ and âgaining port access.â The plan further stated that the hospitality program
would âprovide useful relationship building opportunity for . . . stakeholdersâ and that the invitees
would include the countryâs Minister of Mines and Minister of Transport. The Olympic Leverage
Plan for another country, while not specifically addressing the hospitality program, stated that one
of the goals for the sponsorship was âus[ing] Olympics program to strengthen and build the govtâs
confidence and relationship with [BHPB], to help facilitate approvals for future projects.â

14. After Olympic Leverage Plans were prepared for each country, BHPB business
managers submitted lists of potential invitees and were instructed to rank them in order of
importance, with âCategory Aâ being those âmost critical to the business.â Internal BHPB
presentations discussed the need to establish âthe business benefitâ of an Olympic invitation.

15. Eventually, BHPB invited approximately 650 people to attend the Beijing
Olympics, including 176 government officials, 98 of whom were representatives of state-owned
enterprises that were BHPB customers or suppliers. BHPB also invited the spouses of 102 of these
government officials. Most of the invited government officials were from countries in Africa and
Asia where there was a known risk of corruption. Sixty of these government officials ultimately
attended, 24 of them with their spouses or guests. A number of other invited government officials
accepted their invitations, but then cancelled before the Olympics began.

B. BHPBâs Insufficient Internal Controls over the Olympic Hospitality Program

16. Early in its planning for the Olympics, BHPB identified the risk that inviting
government officials to the Olympics could potentially violate anti-corruption laws and the
companyâs own Guide to Business Conduct. The company relied on its existing operating model
and an Olympic-specific internal approval process to address this risk. However, these internal
controls, and BHPBâs implementation of them, were insufficient.

17. BHPB developed a hospitality application which business managers were required
to complete for any individuals, including government officials, whom they wished to invite.
These applications included the following questions:

9. What business obligation exists or is expected to develop
between the proposed invitee and BHP Billiton?
10. Is BHP Billiton negotiating or considering any contract, license
agreement or seeking access rights with a third party where the
proposed invitee is in a position to influence the outcome of that
negotiation?

11. Do you believe that the offer of the proposed hospitality would
be likely to create an impression that there is an improper
connection between the provision of the hospitality and the business
that is being negotiated, considered or conducted, or in any way
might be perceived as breaching the Companyâs Guide to Business
Conduct?

If yes, please provide details.

12. Are there other matters relating to the relationship between BHP Billiton
and the proposed invitee that you believe should be considered in relation to the
provision of hospitality having regard to BHP Billitonâs Guide to Business
Conduct?

18. BHPB required each such application to be filled out and signed by an employee
with knowledge of the inviteeâs relationship with the company, and approved in writing by the
president of the relevant CSG or the BHPB country president.â A cover sheet that accompanied
the blank forms included a short description of anti-bribery provisions in the Guide to Business
Conduct and urged employees to re-read the section of the Guide concerning travel, entertainment,
and gifts before completing the form. However, the controls did not adequately address the anti-
bribery risks associated with offering expensive travel and entertainment packages to government
officials.

19. First, BHPB did not require independent legal or compliance review of hospitality
applications by someone outside the CSG that was submitting the application, and did not clearly
communicate to its employees the fact that the Ethics Panel was not reviewing and approving each
invitation to a government official. On the one hand, BHPBâs internal website stated that the
hospitality applications were subject to âscrutiny by the Ethics Panel [steering committee],â and
the hospitality applications themselves stated that, â[r]equests for travel and accompanying spouses
will be approved by the Olympic Sponsorship Steering Committee and the Global Ethics Panel
Sub-Committee.â E-mails sent to some BHPB business managers by a member of the OSSC staff
stated that the Ethics Panel had âapprovedâ their applications.

20. However, other than reviewing approximately 10 hospitality applications for
government officials in mid-2007 in order to assess the invitation process, the OSSC and the Ethics
Panel subcommittee did not review the appropriateness of individual hospitality applications or
airfare requests. The Ethics Panelâs charter stated that its role simply was to provide advice on
ethical and compliance matters, and that âaccountability rest[ed] with business leaders.â Members
of the Ethics Panel understood that, consistent with their charter, their role with respect to
implementation of the hospitality program was purely advisory. As a result, business managers
had sole responsibility for reconciling the competing goals of inviting guests â including

 

* In countries where multiple CSGs operated, BHPB had employees designated as âcountry presidentsâ or âcountry
managersâ to coordinate the activities of the various business units.
government officials â who would âmaximize [BHPBâs] commercial investment made in the
Olympic Gamesâ without violating anti-bribery laws.

21. Second, some hospitality applications were not accurate or complete. Many
applications identified an employee of a state-owned enterprise as a âCustomer,â but failed to
identify the invitee as a âRepresentative of Government.â In addition, a number of applications
contained âNoâ responses to Question 10, even when BHPB had pending negotiations, efforts to
obtain access rights, regulatory actions, or other business dealings in which the government
official was directly involved or in a position to influence. Furthermore, in a number of instances,
BHPB business people were provided with examples of language that had been used by other
employees when responding to Questions 10 and 11 in order to explain why an invitation was
appropriate, even when there was a âYesâ response to Questions 10-12. As a result, many
hospitality applications contained the exact same statements in response to Questions 10 and 11,
rather than a description of the specific facts and circumstances relating to that government
official.*

22. Third, while BHPB had an annual Guide to Business Conduct review and
certification process, and generalized training, it did not provide its employees and executives with
any specific training on how to fill out the hospitality forms or how to evaluate whether an
invitation to a government official complied with the Guide. During the relevant period, this
portion of the Guide included a case example concerning a negotiation between BHPB and a
Ministry for Planning in a particular country, in which the Minister indicated that it would help his
consideration of the companyâs application if the Minister and his wife could visit BHPBâs
operations in Australia. The example stated that âthis kind of situation requires the utmost caution
and you must consult senior management. You must not offer to provide anything that could be
reasonably regarded as an attempt to unduly influence the Ministerâs decision. This means that
you must not pay for travel by the Ministerâs wife.â However, BHPB did not provide any
guidance to its senior managers on how they should apply this portion of the Guide when
determining whether to approve invitations and airfares for government officialsâ spouses.

23. Fourth, although the form asked whether any business was âexpected to developâ
with the invitee, BHPB did not institute a process for updating hospitality applications or
reassessing the appropriateness of invitations to government officials if conditions changed.
Almost all of the hospitality applications relating to government officials were approved and
submitted in mid-2007. However, BHPB did not require hospitality forms to be updated, or
invitations to be reconsidered, in those situations when government officials subsequently became
involved in negotiations, attempts by BHPB to obtain access rights, or other pending matters.

24. Fifth, hospitality applications were submitted by individual CSGs, and generally
only reflected negotiations between the government official and that CSG. While lists of invitees
were circulated among senior BHPB business managers, BHPB had no process in place to

 

* For example, a number of hospitality forms included the following response to Question 10: âYes, the invitee is in
a position to influence the outcome of the pending contract, however, this is an organization that we have been
conducting business with for over five years. Negotiations and contract outcomes are a regular occurrence but due
to the lengthy relationship with BHP Billiton there is evidence [of] a long term commitment that would not
necessarily be influenced by this gesture. It is a way of rewarding the business that has previously been conducted
with BHP Billiton.â
determine whether the invited government official also was involved in other CSGsâ negotiations,
efforts to obtain access rights, or other business dealings.

C, As a Result of its Insufficient Internal Controls, BHPB Invited Government Officials
who were Directly Involved in, or in a Position to Influence, Pending Negotiations,
Regulatory Actions, or Business Dealings with BHPB

25. As aresult of its failure to design and maintain sufficient internal controls over the
Olympic global hospitality program, BHPB invited a number of government officials who were
directly involved with, or in a position to influence, pending negotiations, efforts by BHPB to
obtain access rights, or other pending matters.

Republic of Burundi

26. In mid-2007, BHPBâs MinEx group submitted a hospitality application form to
invite the as-yet-unidentified Burundi Minister of Mines and spouse to the Olympics, with airfare
included. Because BHPB was not currently in negotiations with the Minister of Mines at the time,
the hospitality application form contained a âNoâ response to Question 10. However, BHPB had a
joint venture (âJVâ) in Burundi with an entity that was in danger of losing a nickel exploration
permit unless it made a substantial near-term financial investment in the project or negotiated a
renewal or amendment of the permit. Under Burundi law, the Minister of Mines was responsible
for reviewing an application to renew or amend a mining permit and presenting the application to
the countryâs Council of Ministers for final approval.

27. In late 2007 and early 2008, BHPB began to negotiate directly with the newly-
appointed Minister of Mines to extend and modify the JVâs nickel exploration permit. However,
BHPB employees did not update the hospitality application or take steps to re-review the
appropriateness of the invitation after these negotiations began. As noted above, no such re-review
was required by the internal controls that BHPB relied upon for the Olympic hospitality program.
The Minister of Mines and his wife attended the Olympics as BHPBâs guests for four days.

Republic of the Philippines

28. In July 2007, BHPB became embroiled in a dispute with a local JV partner
concerning a prospective nickel mining operation in the Philippines. The JV partner sued BHPB in
local court and filed requests with the countryâs Secretary of Department of Environment and
Resources (âDENRâ), requesting reversion of the mining rights that the JV partner had assigned to
the JV.

29. In October 2007, a BHPB employee from the Stainless Steel Materials CSG
submitted a hospitality application to invite the Secretary and his spouse to attend the Olympics,
with airfare included. The completed application contained a âYesâ response to Question 10, but
only described a technical services agreement that BHPB was considering submitting to the DENR
for the Secretaryâs approval. Question 10 of the hospitality form did not explicitly require, and the
employeeâs response did not provide, any information about the Secretaryâs role in reviewing the
JV partnerâs reversion request or the fact that the President of the Philippines had designated the
Secretary to mediate the dispute between BHPB and its JV partner. The form included a âNoâ
response to Question 11.

30. The Secretary accepted BHPBâs invitation in December 2007. In March 2008, he
issued a decision denying the JV partnerâs reversion request and continued during the ensuing
months to mediate the partiesâ dispute. In late July, BHPB became concerned that the companyâs
JV partner had learned about the Olympics invitation. As a result, BHPB withdrew the invitation
shortly before the Olympics began.

Democratic Republic of the Congo

31. In mid-2007, MinEx submitted a hospitality application form to invite the Governor
of the Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the âDRCâ) and his spouse,
with airfare included. Following its June 2007 review of 10 invitations to government officials, the
Ethics Panel subcommittee advised MinEx to provide more detail about whether the invitation
involved Gecamines, a state-owned entity with which BHPB was attempting to negotiate a copper
exploration deal. In response, MinEx submitted a revised application that contained a âNoâ
response to Question 10, stating, â[t]he issuing and management of mineral titles and negotiations
with third parties in DRC have nothing to do with the Governorâs roles and responsibilities.
Although [BHPB] are currently engaged in negotiations with State copper company, Gecamines,
the Governor of Katanga will have no influence in these dealings.â

32. Later in 2007, however, BHPB employees held several meetings with the
Governor. Internal summaries of these meetings noted that the Governor was âa close ally of [the
DRC] Presidentâ and that having the Governor as BHPBâs ally âcould be the key to unlock a
successful entry in a deal with Gecamines.â In spite of obtaining this information after making the
initial decision to invite the Governor of Katanga and his wife to the Olympics, BHPB employees
did not update the hospitality application form or take steps to re-review the appropriateness of the
invitation. No such re-review was required under the internal controls that BHPB relied upon for
the Olympic hospitality program. The Governor accepted the invitation, but then cancelled before
the Olympics.

Republic of Guinea

33. In May 2007, MinEx submitted a hospitality application to invite the Guinea
Minister of Mines and his spouse to the Olympics, with airfare included. The application
contained a âNoâ response to Question 10, and in response to Question 11 it stated, âNo. A sound
professional relationship with the Guinea Ministry of Mines is key for the success of the [BHPB]
exploration and mining business in this country.â Following its June 2007 review of 10 invitations
to government officials, the Ethics Panel subcommittee advised MinEx to provide additional
information concerning this invitation. The MinEx employee who had prepared the original form
asked BHPBâs Guinea country president to respond to the request for information concerning any
pending negotiations with the Minister. The country president replied that âof courseâ there would
be âfurther negotiationsâ regarding the upcoming renewal of a bauxite mining concession held by
BHPB and the governmentâs intention to review all existing mining concessions, but that the
response to Question 11 was âkey in that regard.â

34. This information was not passed along to the Ethics Panel subcommittee, however,
and the form was not updated to accurately reflect the pending negotiations across all of the CSGs
operating in Guinea. Because they received no response to the Guinea country presidentâs email,
MinEx officials mistakenly understood that the Ethics Panel had approved the invitation. The
Minister accepted the invitation on behalf of himself and his wife in January 2008, but cancelled
shortly before the Olympics began.
Legal Standards and FCPA Violations

35. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or
should have known would contribute to such violation.

36. Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, issuers are required to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer.

37. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, issuers are required to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(1) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization;
(11) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

38. As a result of the conduct described above, BHPB violated Section 13(b)(2)(A)
because its books and records, namely certain Olympic hospitality applications, did not, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect pending negotiations or business dealings between
BHPB and government officials invited to the Olympics. BHPB violated Section 13(b)(2)(B)
because it did not devise and maintain internal accounting controls over the Olympic hospitality
program that were sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that access to assets and
transactions were in executed in accordance with managementâs authorization.

BHPBâs Cooperation and Remedial Efforts

39. In response to the Commissionâs investigation, BHPB retained outside counsel to
assist it with conducting an extensive internal investigation into potential improper conduct in
the jurisdictions that were the subject of the staff's inquiry. BHPB provided significant
cooperation with the Commissionâs investigation by voluntarily producing large volumes of
business, financial, and accounting documents from around the world in response to the staffs
requests, and by voluntarily producing translations of key documents. BHPBâs counsel
conducted scores of interviews and provided the staff with regular reports on the findings of its
internal investigation.

AO. BHPB also has undertaken significant remedial actions. BHPB has created a
compliance group within its legal department that is independent from the business units. This
compliance group is responsible for FCPA compliance, among other things, and reports directly
to BHPBâs general counsel and Audit Committee. In addition, it has reviewed its existing anti-
corruption compliance program and implemented other changes. These include embedding
independent anti-corruption managers into its businesses and further enhancing its policies and
procedures concerning hospitality, gift giving, use of third party agents, business partners, and
other high-risk compliance areas. BHPB also has enhanced its financial and auditing controls,
including policies to specifically address conducting business in high-risk markets. BHPB has
conducted extensive employee training on anti-corruption issues and overhauled its processes for
conducting internal investigations of potential violations of anti-corruption laws.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents BHP Billiton Ltd.âs and BHP Billiton Plceâs Offers.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents cease and desist from

SEC Charges BHP Billiton With Violating FCPA at Olympic Games

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2015-93

Washington D.C., May 20, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global resources company BHP Billiton with
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when it sponsored the attendance of foreign government officials at the Summer Olympics.

BHP Billiton agreed to pay a $25 million penalty to settle the SECâs charges.

An SEC investigation found that BHP Billiton failed to devise and maintain sufficient internal controls over its global hospitality program
connected to the companyâs sponsorship of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government officials and
employees of state-owned enterprises to attend the Games at the companyâs expense, and ultimately paid for 60 such guests as well as
some spouses and others who attended along with them. Sponsored guests were primarily from countries in Africa and Asia, and they
enjoyed three- and four-day hospitality packages that included event tickets, luxury hotel accommodations, and sightseeing excursions
valued at $12,000 to $16,000 per package.

âBHP Billiton footed the bill for foreign government officials to attend the Olympics while they were in a position to help the company with its
business or regulatory endeavors,â said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âBHP Billiton recognized that
inviting government officials to the Olympics created a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws, yet the company failed to implement
sufficient internal controls to address that heightened risk.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, BHP Billiton required business managers to complete a
hospitality application form for any individuals they sought to invite to the Olympics, including government officials. However, the company
did not clearly communicate to employees that no one outside the business unit submitting the application would review and approve each
invitation. BHP Billiton failed to provide employees with any specific training on how to complete forms or evaluate bribery risks of the
invitations. Due to these and other failures, a number of the hospitality applications were inaccurate or incomplete, and BHP Billiton
extended Olympic invitations to government officials connected to pending contract negotiations or regulatory dealings such as the
companyâs efforts to obtain access rights.

âA âcheck the boxâ compliance approach of forms over substance is not enough to comply with the FCPA,â said Antonia Chion, Associate
Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âAlthough BHP Billiton put some internal controls in place around its Olympic hospitality
program, the company failed to provide adequate training to its employees and did not implement procedures to ensure meaningful
preparation, review, and approval of the invitations.â

The SECâs order finds that BHP Billiton violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The settlement,
in which the company neither admits nor denies the SECâs findings, reflects BHP Billitonâs remedial efforts and cooperation with the SECâs
investigation and requires the company to report to the SEC on the operation of its FCPA and anti-corruption compliance program for a one-
year period.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Dmitry Lukovsky and Devon Leppink Staren, and the case was supervised by Alec Koch. The SEC
appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Australian Federal
Police.

SEC Announces Two Non-Prosecution Agreements in FCPA
Cases

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2016-109

Washington D.C., June 7, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced non-prosecution agreements (NPAs) with two
unrelated companies that will forfeit ill-gotten gains connected to bribes paid to Chinese officials by foreign subsidiaries.
Massachusetts-based internet services provider Akamai Technologies has agreed to pay $652,452 in disgorgement plus $19,433 in interest.
According to the NPA, Akamaiâs foreign subsidiary arranged $40,000 in payments to induce government-owned entities to purchase more
services than they actually needed. Employees at the foreign subsidiary violated the companyâs written policies by providing improper gift
cards, meals, and entertainment to officials at these state-owned entities to build business relationships.

Rhode Island-based residential and commercial building products manufacturer Nortek Inc. has agreed to pay $291,403 in disgorgement plus
$30,655 in interest. According to the NPA, approximately $290,000 in improper payments and gifts were made to Chinese officials by
Nortekâs subsidiary in order to receive preferential treatment, relaxed regulatory oversight, or reduced customs duties, taxes, and fees.
These included cash payments, gift cards, meals, travel, accommodations, and entertainment.

Both companies self-reported the misconduct promptly, and they cooperated extensively with the ensuing SEC investigations. The non-
prosecution agreements stipulate that the companies are not charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and do not
pay additional monetary penalties.

âWhen companies self-report and lay all their cards on the table, non-prosecution agreements are an effective way to get the money back
and save the government substantial time and resources while crediting extensive cooperation,â said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC
Enforcement Division.

Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit, added, âAkamai and Nortek each promptly tightened their internal
controls after discovering the bribes and took swift remedial measures to eliminate the problems. They handled it the right way and got
expeditious resolutions as a result.â

Among the companiesâ actions outlined in the NPAs:
e Reported the situation to the SEC on their own initiative in the early stages of internal investigations.

e Shared detailed findings of the internal investigations and provided timely updates to enforcement staff when new information was
uncovered.

e Provided summaries of witness interviews and voluntarily made witnesses available for interviews, including those in China.
e Voluntarily translated documents from Chinese into English.
e Terminated employees responsible for the misconduct.

e Strengthened their anti-corruption policies and conducted extensive mandatory training with employees around the world with a focus
on bolstering internal audit procedures and testing protocols.

The SECâs investigations were conducted by Peter Bryan Moores, Asita Obeyesekere, Mark Albers, and Trevor Donelan. The cases were
supervised by Paul G. Block. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice.

CORPORATION and FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
LARS FROST, AND-DESIST ORDER
Respondents.
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Analogic Corporation (âAnalogicâ) and Lars
Frost (collectively âRespondentsâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent Analogic has submitted
an Offer of Settlement which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to
which the Commission is a party, Respondent Analogic admits the Commissionâs jurisdiction over
it and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent Lars Frost has also
submitted an Offer of Settlement which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent Lars
Frost consents to the entry of this Order, as set forth below.

Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentsâ Offers of Settlement, the Commission finds'
that:

Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the books and records and internal accounting
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by Analogic, a medical device
manufacturer headquartered in Peabody, Massachusetts, and by Lars Frost, a citizen and resident of
Denmark and the former Chief Financial Officer of Analogicâs wholly-owned Danish subsidiary,
BK Medical ApS (âBK Medicalâ), which sells ultrasound equipment.â

2. From at least 2001 through early 2011, BK Medical participated in hundreds of
highly suspicious transactions at its distributorsâ direction which posed a significant risk of bribery
or other improper conduct. The suspicious transactions involved BK Medicalâs distributor in
Russia, as well as, to a lesser extent, its distributors in Ghana, Israel, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and
Vietnam. The transactions routinely involved fictitious invoices issued by BK Medical at inflated
prices, overpayments to BK Medical from the distributors against the inflated invoices, and
subsequent payments by BK Medical out of the distributorsâ excess funds to unknown third parties
all over the world for unknown reasons. In short, for at least nine years, BK Medical acted as a
conduit for its distributors to funnel money to parties, and for reasons, unknown to BK Medical.
Approximately $20 million flowed through BK Medical from these distributors, with over $16
million from BK Medicalâs Russian distributor.

3. BK Medical and, by extension, Analogic derived millions in profits from its sales to
the distributors that directed these suspicious transactions. BK Medicalâs participation in the
transactions resulted in Analogic failing to maintain accurate books and records. Analogic also
failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
prevent and detect this improper conduct that occurred over nearly a decade.

4. Respondent Lars Frost, who was BK Medicalâs Chief Financial Officer from 2008
to 2011, personally authorized approximately 150 conduit payments to unknown third parties
during his tenure at BK Medical despite knowing that the payments violated BK Medicalâs internal
accounting controls. Frost also submitted numerous false quarterly sub-certifications to Analogic.
As a result of his conduct, Frost was a cause of Analogicâs violations described herein.

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentsâ Offers of Settlement and are not binding

on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Â° Lars Frost 1s not related to Analogicâs current Chief Financial Officer, who shares the same last
name.

2
Respondents

5. Analogic Corporation is a Massachusetts corporation that designs and
manufactures advanced medical imaging, ultrasound, and security technology systems. Its
corporate headquarters is in Peabody, Massachusetts and its common stock is registered pursuant
to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol âALOG.â
Among others, Analogic has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Denmark named BK Medical ApS,
which focuses on the manufacture and sale of ultrasound systems. Analogic acquired BK Medical
in 1996 and BK Medicalâs financial results are wholly incorporated into Analogicâs.

6. Lars Frost, age 50, is a resident and citizen of Denmark. From approximately
October 2008 through September 2011, Frost was the Chief Financial Officer of BK Medical. In
this role, he reported to Analogicâs corporate controller and chief accounting officer in the United
States.

Facts

7. Analogicâs ultrasound business is primarily pursued by BK Medical, which sells
ultrasound products to end users â e.g., clinical practitioners â throughout the world. During the
relevant period, BK Medical sold ultrasound products (1) directly to end users through BK
Medicalâs direct sales force, and (ii) indirectly to end users through distributors. The transactions
detailed below took place in connection with BK Medicalâs sales to distributors, which sold BK
Medicalâs ultrasound systems to government-owned hospitals, among other end users.

A. BK Medicalâs Participation in Improper Payment Arrangements

8. From at least December 2001 through early 2011, BK Medical participated in an
improper payment arrangement scheme with its principal distributor selling BK Medicalâs
ultrasound products in Russia. The Russian distributor, located in Moscow, was BK Medicalâs
largest distributor by revenue. The arrangement was employed in connection with the majority of
BK Medicalâs sales to the Russian distributor during the relevant period and generally involved
three steps, each of which the Russian distributor directed.

9. The first step involved the creation of one or more fictitious documents reflecting
an inflated purchase price for the product or products BK Medical was selling to the Russian
distributor.

a. After BK Medical and the Russian distributor reached agreement on the terms of a
particular sale, the Russian distributor would request that BK Medical create a
fictitious, second invoice at an inflated price. The Russian distributor would send
BK Medical a template invoice with the inflated price, which was regularly well in
excess of 100% of the original, agreed-upon price. BK Medicalâs distributor sales
staff understood the inflated price to reflect the price the ultimate end user would
pay to the distributor.
b. BK Medicalâs customer service staff would cut and paste BK Medicalâs logo onto
the template invoice and complete other pertinent fields, such as an invoice number.
These steps were taken outside BK Medicalâs standard invoice-generation system,
in violation of BK Medicalâs internal accounting controls. The fictitious, second
invoice would subsequently accompany the ultrasound products when they were
shipped to Russia. An invoice prepared by BK Medicalâs standard invoice-
generation system reflecting the agreed-upon, actual price would also be sent to the
Russian distributor, often electronically.

c. Separately, the Russian distributor also often sent BK Medical a purported contract
for the sale that listed the higher, inflated price. One of BK Medicalâs distributor
sales staff â often an administrative assistant â would execute the contract on behalf
of BK Medical. BK Medical maintained copies of certain of the fictitious contracts
and fictitious, second invoices.

10. Next, rather than pay the agreed-upon, actual price for the products, the Russian
distributor would pay BK Medical at the inflated price via wire payment. BK Medical recorded
only the agreed-upon, actual price as revenue and credited the excess amount to its accounts
receivable account for the Russian distributor. At times, this resulted in BK Medicalâs accounts
receivable balance for the Russian distributor to be in a net credit position â in other words, BK
Medical effectively owed the Russian distributor money, rather than vice versa.

11. Then, at some point weeks or months later, the Russian distributor would direct BK
Medical to make a wire payment out of the excess funds to a third party that was otherwise
unknown to BK Medical. BK Medical complied with the directives, despite not knowing the
purpose of the payments or the nature of the payees.

a. The directive often came in the form of an email or fax, with only the payeeâs wire
information and the amount. The payees ranged from apparent shell corporations
located in places such as Belize, the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Seychelles,
to specific individuals in Russia. At times, a fictitious invoice for marketing,
logistics, or other services ostensibly rendered to BK Medical by the payee would
accompany the directive from the Russian distributor. These invoices were not
entered into BK Medicalâs accounts payable system, as BK Medicalâs internal
accounting controls required.

b. Two approvals were generally required before BK Medical made the payments.
First, an individual in BK Medicalâs distributor sales staff would approve the
payment. Next, an individual in BK Medicalâs finance staff would review and
approve the wire transfer. The payee banks to which the payments were sent were
located all over the world, although approximately half of the payments went to
banks in Latvia, on Russiaâs border.

c. The payments were not made through BK Medicalâs accounts payable system, as
was required by BK Medicalâs internal accounting controls. Instead, BK Medical

4
simply credited its cash account and made an offsetting debit to its accounts
receivable account for the Russian distributor. In those instances where the Russian
distributor had provided a fictitious invoice from the payee, the authorizing
signatures would be applied directly on the fictitious invoice, which would
subsequently be kept in BK Medicalâs files.

d. For the majority of the payments to third parties, the payment amount was less than
the sum of the amounts the Russian distributor had previously overpaid BK
Medical and that remained as excess funds in BK Medicalâs accounts receivable
account for the Russian distributor. On at least two occasions, however, payments
to third parties were made before sufficient overpayment funds had been paid to BK
Medical. In those two cases, BK Medical made approximately $95,000 in total
payments to unknown third parties, for unknown reasons, before receiving the
funds from the Russian distributor.

12. In total, during at least the period December 2001 to early 2011, BK Medical
served as a conduit for at least 180 of these payments to third parties pursuant to this arrangement
with its Russian distributor, totaling approximately $16.1 million. Over this period, BK Medical,
and by extension Analogic, recorded approximately $21.6 million in revenue on its sales to its
Russian distributor.

13. During this same period, BK Medical participated in similar arrangements, but to a
lesser degree, with its distributors in Ghana, Israel, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Vietnam. The
arrangements broadly followed the same structure, though the degree to which fictitious documents
were created varied by distributor. Over this period, BK Medical served as a conduit for at least 80
payments to third parties pursuant to arrangements with these other distributors, totaling
approximately $3.8 million.

14. BK Medicalâs participation in these payment arrangements with its distributors
created a significant risk that BK Medical was facilitating bribery or other prohibited conduct, such
as embezzlement or tax evasion.

B. Identification of Bribery Risks Associated with Distributors

15. In or around 2004, BK Medicalâs Vice President of Sales for distributors asked his
principal contact at the Russian distributor about the purpose of the payments to third parties and
later memorialized his understanding in the form of a ghostwritten email from the contact to
himself. The email stated, among other things, that the payments were necessary due to âRussian
market conditionsâ; that âthe level of official salaries in many sectors are still extremely lowâ; that
the payments are for, among other things, âgeneral improvements of the standard of living of ...
persons on high levelsâ; and that â[i]f you cannot continue to help us with the money transfers, we
will risk up to 90% of our B-K business.â The email then stated: âPlease understand that your
western word âbribeâ is not used in our Russian market. We talk about customer obligations,
nothing else ....â Notwithstanding these red flags, the payments to unknown third parties
continued for six more years.
16. In 2008, a Senior Vice President at Analogic concluded that BK Medical presented
a âsignificantly greater riskâ of violating the FCPA than Analogicâs other business lines, because
BK Medicalâs products âgo in completed form to ... hospitals, many of which are government
owned.â In addition to recommending that BK Medical implement a FCPA training program, the
Senior Vice President recommended in an email to Analogicâs senior management that BK
Medical put in place an âofficial process for validating that their distribution partners do not, or are
not likely to engage in prohibited behavior.â Analogic then provided a business ethics and FCPA
compliance training to BK Medical sales and finance staff, but no official process was
implemented, and no steps were taken to validate whether its Russian distributor or any other
distributor was engaged in prohibited behavior.

C. Analogic Failed to Make and Keep Accurate Books and Records and Maintain
an Adequate Internal Accounting Control System

17. BK Medicalâs participation in the transactions involved the routine creation and/or
ratification of several types of fictitious documents, which BK Medical maintained in its books and
records and, in some cases, used to support payments made to third parties. These documents
included fictitious BK Medical invoices, contracts, and invoices from third parties for services
never rendered to BK Medical. Moreover, BK Medical made and recorded hundreds of
transactions in its books and records for which BK Medical did not know the business purpose and
therefore was unable to account for accurately. These recorded transactions, and the fictitious
documents upon which they were predicated, were incorporated into Analogicâs books and
records, which were rendered inaccurate as a result.

18. Analogicâs internal accounting controls system was also deficient. BK Medical
was able to process hundreds of sham, conduit transactions involving millions of dollars in
payments outside the companyâs accounting systems for nearly ten years.

D. Lars Frostâs Role in Analogicâs Inaccurate Books and Records and
Internal Accounting Controls Failures

19. Frost jomed BK Medicalâs finance department in 1999 and was promoted
ultimately to BK Medicalâs Chief Financial Officer position in approximately October 2008, which
position he held until Analogic caused BK Medical to terminate his employment in September
2011. In the CFO role, Frost was BK Medicalâs chief accounting officer, was responsible for
ensuring BK Medicalâs compliance with its internal accounting controls, and reported directly to
Analogicâs corporate controller and chief accounting officer in the United States.

20. During his tenure at BK Medical, Frost approved approximately 150 payments
outside of BK Medicalâs accounts payable system to unknown third parties, approximately 10 of
which were while he was the BK Medical CFO. At times, he authorized the payments by applying
his initials to fictitious invoices from third parties for services never rendered to BK Medical. BK
Medical had regularly participated in these transactions before Frost became CFO of BK Medical
and he took no steps to stop them after he became CFO.

6
21. Frost authorized payments to unknown third parties outside the accounts payable
system knowing that doing so was inconsistent with â and circumvented â the internal accounting
controls in place at BK Medical, which required all payments to be processed through accounts
payable. Further, both before and after he became BK Medicalâs CFO, Frost executed internal
sub-certifications for Analogic on a quarterly basis certifying BK Medicalâs compliance with its
accounts payable controls, among other internal accounting controls, notwithstanding knowledge
that the payments violated those controls. As BK Medicalâs CFO, Frost also signed quarterly
financial-statement sub-certifications for Analogic, certifying that all material financial
transactions at BK Medical had been properly recorded, notwithstanding that Frost did not know
the business purpose of the payments to third parties. Both of these sets of sub-certifications were
incorporated into Analogicâs books and records. Frost was also aware of the fictitious contracts
that BK Medicalâs Russian distributor requested BK Medical execute. Finally, Frost also
completed quarterly checklists for Analogicâs controller, the purpose of which was to identify
unusual transactions and changes in the status of internal controls, among other matters. Frost
failed to disclose the payment arrangements in connection with these checklists or in related
discussions with Analogicâs controller. These incomplete checklists were also incorporated into
Analogicâs books and records.

Violations of the Recordkeeping and Internal Accounting Controls Provisions of the FCPA

22. As a result of the conduct described above, Analogic violated Section 13(b)(2)(A)
of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and
accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions
of their assets.

23. As aresult of the conduct described above, Analogic also violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization.

24. As aresult of his conduct described above, Lars Frost was a cause of Analogicâs
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

25. As a result of his conduct described above, Lars Frost also violated Section 13(b)(5)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, which prohibit persons from knowingly
circumventing or knowingly failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls,
knowingly falsifying any book, record or account, and directly or indirectly falsifying or causing to
be falsified any book, record, or account.

Analogicâs Self-Report, Cooperation, and Remedial Efforts
206. Upon discovering the payment arrangements at BK Medical, Analogic halted the
transactions, conducted an internal investigation, and subsequently self-reported its findings,

including an accounting of all of the suspicious payments to third parties by distributor and

7
recipient. Analogic thereafter generally cooperated with the Commission staff's investigation.
Analogic further took a number of remedial efforts, including (1) terminating BK Medicalâs
relationship with eight distributors; (2) improving BK Medicalâs distributor due diligence and
distributor agreements; (3) terminating a number of BK Medical employees (including Lars Frost
and the Vice President of Sales for distributors) and disciplining other BK Medical employees
involved in the transactions; (4) enhancing Analogicâs general oversight of BK Medical and hiring
a corporate compliance officer; (5) remediating and improving BK Medicalâs internal accounting
controls; and (6) requiring additional and ongoing compliance training for BK Medical and
Analogic employees.

27. In determining to accept Analogicâs Offer, the Commission considered Analogicâs
self-report, cooperation, and remedial acts.

Non-Prosecution Agreement

28. BK Medical has entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the United States
Department of Justice that acknowledges responsibility for conduct relating to certain of the
findings in this Order.

29. Respondent Analogic acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil
penalty based in part upon BK Medicalâs payment of a $3,402,000 criminal fine as part of BK
Medicalâs settlement with the United States Department of Justice.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondentsâ Offers.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Analogic cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

B. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Lars Frost cease and
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A),
13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.

C. Respondent Analogic shall, within 14 days of the entry of this Order, pay
disgorgement of $7,672,651 and prejudgment interest of $3,810,311 to the Securities and
Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to
Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue
pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.
D. Respondent Lars Frost shall pay a civil money penalty of $20,000 to the Securities
and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to
Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). Payment shall be made in the following installments: $5,000
within 14 days of entry of this Order; $2,500 within 120 days of entry of this Order; $5,000 within
240 days of entry of this Order; and $7,500 within 360 days of entry of this Order. If any payment
is not made by the date the payment is required by this Order, the entire outstanding balance of the
civil money penalty, plus any additional interest accrued pursuant to pursuant to 31 U.S.C. Â§ 3717,
shall be due and payable immediately, without further application.

Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1) Respondents may transmit payment electronically to the Commission,
which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon

request;

(2) Respondents may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Analogic or Lars Frost as a Respondent in these proceedings, as appropriate, and the file number of
these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Paul G.
Block, Assistant Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Boston
Regional Office, 33 Arch Street, Boston, MA 02110.

E. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent Lars Frost agrees that in any Related
Investor Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction
of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondentâs payment of a
civil penalty in this action (âPenalty Offsetâ). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants
such a Penalty Offset, Respondent Lars Frost agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a
final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the
amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall
not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a âRelated Investor Actionâ

9
means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

V.

It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section

issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§
523(a)(19).

SEC Charges Medical Device Manufacturer With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2016-126

Washington D.C., June 21, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Massachusetts-based medical device
manufacturer Analogic Corp. and its wholly-owned Danish subsidiary have agreed to pay nearly $15 million to settle parallel civil and criminal
actions involving Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations.

An SEC investigation found that Analogicâs Danish subsidiary, BK Medical ApS, engaged in hundreds of sham transactions with distributors
that funneled about $20 million to third parties, including individuals in Russia and apparent shell companies in Belize, the British Virgin
Islands, Cyprus, and Seychelles.

Analogic agreed to pay $7.67 million in disgorgement and $3.8 million in prejudgment interest to settle the SECâs charges that it failed to
keep accurate books and records and maintain adequate internal accounting controls. In determining the settlement, the SEC considered
Analogicâs self-reporting, remedial acts, and general cooperation with the SECâs investigation. BK Medical agreed to pay a $3.4 million
criminal fine in a non-prosecution agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âAnalogicâs subsidiary, BK Medical, allowed itself to be used as a slush fund for its distributors, funneling millions of dollars around the world
at its distributorsâ direction without knowing the purpose of the payments or anything about the recipients,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of
the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âIssuers and their subsidiaries cannot turn a blind eye to suspicious payments, even if they
believe they are simply âhelping outâ a business partner.â

Lars Frost, BK Medicalâs former Chief Financial Officer, agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty to the SEC to settle charges that he knowingly
circumvented the internal controls in place at BK Medical and falsified its books and records.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Analogic and Frost:
e From at least 2001 through early 2011, at the direction of its distributors, BK Medical participated in hundreds of highly suspicious
transactions that posed a significant risk of bribery or other improper conduct, such as embezzlement or tax evasion.

e At its distributorsâ request, BK Medical would issue fictitious inflated invoices to the distributors and direct the overpayments it received
to third parties identified by the distributors. BK Medical did not have a relationship with the third parties and did not know if the
payments had any business purpose.

e BK Medicalâs Russian distributor accounted for at least 180 payments totaling more than $16 million. BK Medical participated in similar
arrangements, but to a lesser degree, with distributors in Ghana, Israel, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Vietnam, for which BK Medical acted
as a conduit for at least 80 payments totaling approximately $3.8 million.

e Frost, who was BK Medicalâs CFO from 2008 to 2011, personally authorized approximately 150 conduit payments and submitted false
quarterly sub-certifications to Analogic.

Frost, a Danish citizen, consented to the SECâs order without admitting or denying the findings that he caused Analogicâs violations and that
he violated provisions of the federal securities laws and a related SEC rule that prohibit the knowing circumvention of internal controls and
knowing falsification of books and records.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by James R. Drabick and Patrick Noone of the Boston Regional Office and was supervised by Paul G.
Block of the FCPA Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office
for the District of Massachusetts, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the Danish State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and
International Crime, the Austrian Financial Market Authority, the Latvian Financial and Capital Market Commission and the Financial Services
Commission of the British Virgin Islands.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
LAN Airlines S.A. EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I,

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against LAN Airlines S.A. (ââLANâ or âRespondentâ),
now known as LATAM Airlines Group.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the entry of this
Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderââ), as
set forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (the âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. 78dd] by Respondent LAN Airlines S.A. In 2006 and 2007,
LAN, through Ignacio Cueto Plaza (âthe CEOâ), the current CEO of LAN, authorized $1.15
million in improper payments to a third party consultant in Argentina in connection with LANâs
attempts to settle disputes on wages and other work conditions between LAN Argentina S.A.
(âLAN Argentinaâ), a subsidiary of LAN, and its employees.* At the time, LAN understood that
it was possible the consultant would pass some portion of the $1.15 million to union officials in
Argentina. The payments were made pursuant to an unsigned consulting agreement that
purported to provide services that LAN understood would not occur. The CEO authorized
subordinates to make the payments that were improperly booked in the Companyâs books and
records, which circumvented LANâs internal accounting controls.

Respondent

2. LAN Airlines S.A. (âLANâ) was a publicly traded airline company headquartered
in Santiago, Chile, that provided passenger and cargo airline services throughout Latin America.
LAN merged with TAM, S.A. in 2012. Throughout the relevant period, LANâs common stock
was registered in the United States pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and LAN filed
annual and quarterly reports as required under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules
thereunder. Prior to the merger with TAM, LANâs common stock traded on the NYSE under the
symbol âLFL.â

Relevant Entities

3. LATAM Airlines Group (âLATAMYâ) is a Chilean based holding company. LAN
became LATAM after the merger of LAN and its consolidated subsidiaries/or affiliates and TAM,
S.A. and its consolidated subsidiaries (âTAMâ) on June 22, 2012. Following the merger,
LATAMâs holdings included LAN and its subsidiaries/or affiliates in Peru, Argentina, Colombia
and Ecuador, TAM and its subsidiaries, and LAN Cargo and its affiliates. LATAMâs common
stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and LATAM files annual and
quarterly reports as required under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules thereunder.
LATAMâs common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol âLFL.â

4. LAN Argentina S.A. (âLAN Argentinaâ), formerly known as AERO 2000, was a
subsidiary of LAN during the relevant period. LAN Argentina began operations in 2005, and

operated domestic and international flights throughout Latin America. It continues to do business
as part of LATAM. LAN Argentinaâs books and records were consolidated into the books and
records of LAN and later LATAM.

5. Atlantic Aviation Investments LLC (âAAIâ) was an indirect subsidiary of LAN
incorporated in Delaware. LAN used AAI to conceal the sham payments to a company controlled
by its consultant in Argentina. AAIâs books and records were consolidated into the financial
statements of LAN and later LATAM.

LANâs Entry into Argentina

6. For several years prior to 2004, LAN, a Chilean airline, explored expansion into
Argentina. LAN put its Vice President of Business Development at LAN Cargo, a LAN
subsidiary, in charge of the expansion efforts. The Vice President of Business Development was
based in Miami, Florida, and reported directly to the CEO.

7. In late 2004, the Vice President of Business Development received a call from a
lawyer and purported business consultant in Argentina offering to help LAN with its expansion
efforts. The two men later met in Buenos Aires and discussed the obstacles that LAN might face
in trying to break into the Argentine airline market. Following the meeting, they kept in touch.

8. In early 2005, officials from the Argentine Transportation Secretaryâs Office
contacted LAN to ask whether it would be interested in purchasing Lineas Aereas Federales S.A.
(âLAFSAâ), a state owned airline, as a means to enter Argentina. LAN declined the offer to
purchase LAFSA but continued discussions with government officials to enter into the market.
Eventually the officials informed LAN that LAFSA would cease operations and LAN could enter
the Argentine market through the purchase of 49% of the shares of AERO 2000, a non-operating
Argentinean airline that possessed an airline operation certificate and owned various flight routes.
As part of the deal, LAN agreed to hire workers from LAFSA and another Argentine airline,
Southern Winds, to operate AERO 2000.

9. In March 2005, the CEO and the Vice President of Business Development met with
the President of Argentina and the Transportation Secretary, as well as other officials from the
Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, and Transportation to finalize the
terms of the deal. LAN completed its purchase of 49% of AERO 2000 on or about April 2005, and
AERO 2000 began operations in June 2005. In December 2005, AERO 2000âs name was changed
to LAN Argentina S.A. The LAN employees primarily involved in these negotiations were the
Vice President of Business Development and the General Manager of LAN Argentina, who later
became Chief Operating Officer of LAN. Both employees reported directly to the CEO.

LAN Faces Major Issues Upon Entering the Argentine Market

10. Upon entering the Argentine passenger airline market LAN immediately faced
several major issues impacting its viability and began losing money. First, it needed to meet
demands from labor unions representing the employees acquired from LAFSA and Southern
Winds. Second, LAN needed majority ownership of its Argentine subsidiary, and therefore had to

3
persuade the Argentine government to change its existing law on foreign ownership of domestic
airlines and to increase caps on airfares. Third, LAN needed regulatory authorization to operate
various flight routes, both domestically and internationally, in Argentina. Since the Argentine
passenger airline market was heavily regulated by the government, particularly officials within the
Department of Transportation who had close ties to the unions, LAN engaged in discussions with
government officials with each of these issues.

11. LAN executives, including the CEO, knew that for LAN Argentina to become
profitable it would need an infusion of cash. LAN asked Argentine government officials to
liberalize the laws on foreign ownership so that LAN could own a majority share of LAN
Argentina and sought government authorization to raise regulated airfares. On or about August 8,
2006, the President of Argentina signed a Decree that enabled LAN to become a majority owner of
LAN Argentina and allowed LAN to raise airfares by 20%. LAN Argentina was also awarded
critical additional flight routes by the Transportation Secretary.

LAN Encounters Problems with the Unions in Argentina

12. The Argentine government in March 2005, required that LAN hire between six and
eight hundred employees from the defunct LAFSA and Southern Winds airlines. LAN was bound
by the existing bargaining agreements between LAFSA, Southern Winds and the labor unions.

13. There were five unions representing airline employees in Argentina. They included
the grounds crew union, the Asociacidn del Personal Aeronautico (APA), the pilotsâ union, the
Asociacion de Pilotos de Lineas AÃ©reas (APLA), the mechanicsâ union, AsociaciÃ©n del Personal
Tecnico Aeronautico (APTA), the flight attendantsâ union, AsociaciÃ©n de Tripulantes de Cabina de
Pasajeros de Empresas Aerocomerdiales (ATCPEA), and the supervisorsâ union, Union del
Personal Superior y Profesional de Empresas Aerocomerciales (UPSA).

14. All of the unions were powerful and unafraid to make demands on LAN. They
sought wage increases and additional benefits, and used the terms of their respective Collective
Bargaining Agreements (âCBAsâ) as leverage. These labor agreements contained provisions that
LAN believed were unfavorable, such as restrictions on the hours employees could work and their
work locations.

15. The mechanicsâ union, the flight attendantsâ union and the supervisorsâ union each
had a single-function rule contained in their collective CBAs. The single-function rule was a
provision that limited workers from performing more than one work function for LAN. The
single-function rule was loosely interpreted and for the most part not enforced by the unions. Had
it been enforced, the single-function rule would have required LAN to double its work force and
would have seriously imperiled LANâs ability to continue its operations in Argentina.

16. Around 2006 the unions began campaigning for wage increases. The unions
threatened to enforce the single-function rule unless LAN Argentina agreed to a substantial wage
increase. LANâs management, including the CEO, attempted to negotiate on the wage issues but
made no progress and things worsened over time. Eventually there were work stoppages and
slowdowns on the part of the workforce, including strikes involving the pilotsâ and the mechanicsâ
unions.

17. In early 2006, the consultant again contacted the Vice President of Business
Development and offered to assist LAN in Argentina. By this time, the consultant was a Cabinet
Advisor in the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, Department of
Transportation. On January 31, 2005, the Secretary of Transportation appointed the consultant as a
Cabinet Advisor âad-honoremâ pursuant to an unpublished Resolutionâ

LAN Makes Improper Payments

18. Beginning in the summer of 2006, the consultant supplied some LAN executives
with information on how to deal with specific union members and the unions in general.
Eventually, the consultant offered to negotiate directly with the unions on LANâs behalf, making it
clear that he would expect compensation for such negotiations, and that payments would be made
to third parties who had influence over the unions. After his staff informed the CEO that the
consultant was well connected with the unions and could effectively negotiate an agreement with
union officials, the CEO approved the retention of the consultant.

19. During the summer of 2006, the CEO approved payments totaling $1,150,000 to
the consultant in connection with LANâs attempts to settle disputes on wages and other work
conditions with the unions. At the time, the CEO understood that it was possible the consultant
would pass some portion of the $1.15 million to union officials in Argentina. The CEO approved
the payments to get the unions to abandon their threats to enforce the single-function rule and to
get them to accept a wage increase lower than the amount asked for in negotiations. LAN and the
consultant agreed that LAN would make the payment to a company controlled by the consultant in
Argentina. In 2006, LAN did not have a policy requiring that due diligence be performed on
consultants, and neither the CEO nor LAN conducted any due diligence on the consultant or any of
his related entities.

20. Around August 2006, the CEOâs staff informed him that the consultant had reached
an oral agreement to settle the wage dispute with the mechanicsâ union on LANâs behalf.
Although the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement with the mechanicsâ union would remain
unchanged, the CEO understood that the union would orally agree not to seek enforcement of the
single-function rule for a period of four years in exchange for a wage increase of approximately
15% of salary. The wage increase of approximately 15% was lower than the amount originally
sought by the mechanicsâ union.

21. Around August 2006, the flight attendantsâ and supervisorsâ unions both agreed to
accept wage increases of approximately 15% and 10% respectively of salaries. The amounts were
lower than the amounts originally sought by each union.

 

The consultant resigned from the position on or about July 2, 2009.

5
Sham Contract with Consultantâs Company

22. On October 2, 2006, the consultant sent the Vice President of Business
Development an e-mail attaching a draft consulting contract between LAN and the consultantâs
company for his âconsideration.â The consultant copied the e-mail and draft contract to a chief
advisor to the Transportation Secretary who oversaw airline and union issues. The following day,
the Vice President of Business Development forwarded the draft contract to the CEO for his
review. The contract described the $1,150,000 to be paid to the consultantâs company in three
installments, and falsely stated that the consultant would undertake a study of existing air routes in
Argentina and the regional market as a basis for the payment. The draft contract was never signed
by the parties. The CEO knew that the consultant would not perform a study. The CEO did not
inform anyone at LAN that the contract falsely stated the purpose of the payments to the
consultant.

23. To further disguise the sham arrangement, an unrelated LAN subsidiary, AAI
incorporated in Delaware, was used to make the improper payments to the consultantâs company.
Around October 20, 2006, the consultantâs company sent a backdated invoice for $300,000 to AAT,
the LAN subsidiary that was designated by LAN to make the improper payments to the
consultantâs company. The invoice indicated that the amount due was for âconsulting services
provided by and payable...under contract signed by both parties.â It also contained wire transfer
instructions to a brokerage account in Virginia owned by the consultant and his wife. On October
20, 2006, LAN wired the $300,000 to the brokerage account. Additional invoices for $300,000 on
November 21, 2006 and $550,000 on January 17, 2007 were sent to AAI and paid to the same
brokerage account. All of the improperly booked payments to the consultantâs company were
intentionally mis-recorded as payments to âother debtorsâ on AAIâs books and records.

24. In November 2007, the Vice President of Business Development received an
invoice from the consultant for $58,000 payable to an account in Spain in the name of another
company, which was owned by the consultantâs son and wife and was headquartered in Costa
Rica. The invoice was also directed for payment by LANâs AAI subsidiary. The payment was in
addition to the $1.15 million already authorized by the CEO and paid to the consultant. The CEO
received a copy of the invoice via e-mail from the Vice President of Business Development. Like
the consultantâs draft contract, the invoice indicated that it was for payment for a study of existing
air routes in Argentina and the regional market, which the CEO knew was inaccurate. In
November 2007, LAN paid the invoice.

25. The CEO approved the consultantâs compensation and instructed the CFO of LAN
to pay the consultantâs invoices. The invoices contained false references to consulting services that
were never rendered by the consultant. At the trme he approved the payments to the consultant, the
CEO knew that the unsigned consulting contract with the consultantâs company was a sham
contract. The CEO did not inform the CFO or LANâs legal department that $1,150,000 in
payments was being made to the consultantâs company pursuant to a fake contract for improper
purposes. Further, while copied on an email attaching the $58,000 invoice for payment to the
company owned by consultantâs son and wife, the CEO took no action to stop the payment, which
he knew contained false references to services never rendered.

6
26. LAN obtained a benefit of $6,743,932 as a result of the improper payments to
resolve LANâs union issues.

Failure to Maintain Accurate Books and Records

27. LAN, directly and through LAN Argentina and AAI, failed to make and keep
books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflected LANâs transactions with the
consultantâs company and the company owned by consultantâs son and wife. The improper
payments were concealed within AAIâs books and records in transitory holding accounts. Later,
the payments were mis-recorded in AAIâs accounts as âvarious other debtorsâ debits.â LAN failed
to accurately disclose in its books and records that payments to consultantâs company and the
company owned by consultantâs son and wife could benefit union officials in Argentina.

Failure to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

28. LAN failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting
controls. The controls in place during 2006 and 2007 were minimal and clearly deficient. The
conduct in Argentina involved executives at the highest levels of LAN. High level executives
approved the payments to the consultantâs company and to the company owned by consultantâs son
and wife, and other executives and managers made the payments while overlooking numerous red
flags. During the relevant period LAN had no internal controls requiring due diligence on third
parties, and as a result no due diligence was conducted on the consultant or his related entities, or
the company owned by his son and wife. If a due diligence review had been conducted on the
consultant, LAN might have become aware of his January 2005 appointment as a Cabinet Advisor
to Argentinaâs Transportation Secretary.

29. The payments to the consultant were supported by a sham contract between the
consultantâs company and AAI, a LAN subsidiary incorporated in Delaware that had no personnel
and was completely unrelated to LANâs business in Argentina. LANâs legal department reviewed
the sham contract with the consultantâs company and raised no concerns. The contract was never
finalized and never signed by the parties. LANâs accounting division did not require any proof of
services before paying the $1,150,000 to the consultantâs company, and no one questioned why
payments were wired to a U.S. brokerage account in the name of the consultant and his wife rather
than to an account in the name of the consultantâs company. Similarly, LAN paid $58,000 to a
Costa Rican company owned by the consultantâs wife and son without any proof of services.
Despite the consultantâs receipt of illicit funds in 2006 and 2007, LAN executives considered
hiring him again in 2009 to work on another airline matter but ultimately did not retain him.

30. LAN did not implement even the most basic compliance controls until 2008, when
it issued a new Code of Conduct, which for the first time contained anti-corruption policies. The
company did not offer any compliance training until about 2010, and the training was minimal and
did not apply to all employees. Training did not become compulsory for managers until about
2011.
31. LAN did not implement a comprehensive company-wide corporate compliance
program until early 2014. In addition, the primary individuals who caused the controls failures at
LAN and LAN Argentina are still with the company and no disciplinary action has been taken
against them.

Legal Standards and Violations

32. As a result of the conduct described above, LAN violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to make and keep books, records, and accounts which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
issuer.

33. In addition, as a result of the conduct described above, LAN violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (1) transactions are
executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization; (11) transactions are
recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II) to
maintain accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect
to any differences.

Remedial Actions and Undertakings

34. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
undertaken by Respondent. In 2008, LAN began steps to create a basic compliance program by
hiring a new General Counsel and Vice President who was tasked with monitoring the compliance
department. In 2013, LATAM adopted a new Code of Conduct, as well as other internal corporate
policies, including an Anti-Corruption Guide, a Gifts, Travel, Hospitality and Entertainment
Policy, an Escalation Policy, and Procurement and Payment policies. The new compliance
program was implemented in early 2014. LAN also hired a new Compliance Manager who, along
with two deputies and a senior compliance analyst, oversees twenty people, including regional
heads of legal, located in nine different regions to ensure compliance. LATAM also now requires
annual training of employees who must certify compliance with LANâs Code of Conduct.

35. Respondent undertakes to do the following: in connection with this action and any
related judicial or administrative proceeding or investigation commenced by the Commission or to
which the Commission is a party, Respondent (i) agrees to appear and be interviewed by
Commission staff at such times and places as the staff requests upon reasonable notice; (11) will
accept service by mail or facsimile transmission of notices or subpoenas issued by the Commission
for documents or testimony at depositions, hearings, or trials, or in connection with any related
investigation by Commission staff; (111) appoints Respondent's undersigned attorney as agent to
receive service of such notices and subpoenas; (iv) with respect to such notices and subpoenas,
waives the territorial limits on service contained in Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

8
and any applicable local rules, provided that the party requesting the testimony reimburses
Respondent's travel, lodging, and subsistence expenses at the then-prevailing U.S. Government per
diem rates; and (v) consents to personal jurisdiction over Respondent in any United States District
Court for purposes of enforcing any such subpoena.

36. Respondent undertakes to engage an Independent Compliance Monitor pursuant to
the provisions set forth in Attachment A of the Order.

37. Respondent undertakes to require the Independent Compliance Monitor to enter
into an agreement that provides that for the period of engagement and for a period of two years
from completion of the engagement, the Independent Compliance Monitor shall not enter into any
employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with
Respondent, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents
acting in their capacity. The agreement will also provide that the Independent Compliance
Monitor will require that any firm with which he/she is affiliated or of which he/she is a member,
and any person engaged to assist the Independent Compliance Monitor in performance of his/her
duties under this Order shall not, without prior written consent of the Division of Enforcement,
enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship
with Respondent, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents
acting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years after
the engagement.

38. Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertaking(s) set forth above. The
certification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide written evidence of compliance in the form
of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The
Commission staff may make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and
Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and supporting material shall be
submitted to Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, FCPA Unit Chief, Division of Enforcement, U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Mail Stop 5631, Washington, D.C.
20549, with a copy to the Office of Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than sixty
(60) days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.

Deferred Prosecution Agreement

39, Respondent has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department
of Justice that acknowledges responsibility for criminal conduct relating to the findings in the
Order. Specifically, Respondent acknowledges responsibility for (i) violating the internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§
78m(b)(2)(B), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a); and (11) violating the FCPAâs books and records provisions,
15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a).
Non-Imposition of a Civil Penalty

AO. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty
based upon its payment of a $12,750,000 criminal fine as part of Respondentâs settlement with the
United States Department of Justice.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent LAN Airlines S.A.âs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent LAN Airlines S.A. cease

Retention of Monitor and Term of Engagement

1. The Company shall engage an independent compliance monitor (the âMonitorââ)
not unacceptable to the Commission staff within sixty (60) calendar days of the issuance of the
Order. The Monitor shall have, at a minimum, the following qualifications: (1) demonstrated

laws, including experience counseling on FCPA issues; (11) experience designing and/or
reviewing corporate compliance policies, procedures, and internal accounting controls, including
FCPA and anti-corruption policies, procedures, and internal accounting controls; (111) the ability
to access and deploy resources as necessary to discharge the Monitorâs duties; and (iv) sufficient
independence from the Company to ensure effective and impartial performance of the Monitorâs
duties. The Commission staff may extend the Companyâs time period to retain the Monitor in its
sole discretion. If the Monitor resigns or is otherwise unable to fulfill the obligations herein, the
Company shall retain a Monitor that is not unacceptable to the Commission staff within thirty
(30) calendar days.

2. The Company shall retain the Monitor for a period of not less than twenty-seven
(27) months from the date the Monitor is retained (the âTerm of the Monitorshipâ), unless the
Commission staff finds, in its sole discretion, that there exists a change in circumstances
sufficient to terminate the Monitorship early or extend the Monitorship as set forth in paragraphs

24-25 (Termination or Extension of Monitorship).
Company âs Obligations

3. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Monitor, and provide the Monitor
with access to all information, documents, records, facilities, and employees as reasonably
requested by the Monitor. The Company shall use its best efforts to provide the Monitor with
access to the Companyâs former employees and its third-party vendors, agents, and consultants.

4. The parties agree that no attorney-client relationship shall be formed between the
Company and the Monitor. In the event that the Company seeks to withhold from the Monitor
access to information, documents, records, facilities, current or former employees of the
Company, its third-party vendors, agents, or consultants that may be subject to a claim of
attorney-client privilege or to the attorney work-product doctrine, or where the Company
reasonably believes production would otherwise be inconsistent with applicable law, the
Company shall work cooperatively with the Monitor to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of
the Monitor. If, during the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor believes that the Company is
unreasonably withholding access on the basis of a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product doctrine, or other asserted applicable law, the Monitor shall promptly notify the
Commission staff.

5. Any disclosure by the Company to the Monitor concerning corrupt payments,
false books and records, and internal accounting control failures shall not relieve the Company of
any otherwise applicable obligation to truthfully disclose such matters to the Commission staff.

Monitorâs Mandate
6. The Monitor shall evaluate the effectiveness of the internal accounting controls,

record-keeping, and financial reporting policies and procedures of the Company as they relate to
the Companyâs current and ongoing compliance with the anti-bribery, books and records, and
internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws
(the âanti-corruption lawsâ), and make recommendations reasonably designed to improve the
effectiveness of the Companyâs internal accounting controls and corporate compliance program
(the âMandateâ). This Mandate shall include an assessment of the Board of Directorsâ and
senior managementâs commitment to, and effective implementation of, the corporate compliance
program. In carrying out the Mandate, to the extent appropriate under the circumstances, the
Monitor may coordinate with Company personnel, including in-house counsel, compliance
personnel, and internal auditors. The Monitor may rely on the product of the Companyâs
processes, such as the results of studies, reviews, sampling and testing methodologies, audits,
and analyses conducted by or on behalf of the Company, as well as the Companyâs internal
resources (e.g., legal, compliance, and internal audit), which can assist the Monitor in carrying
out the Mandate, provided the Monitor has confidence in the quality of those resources and the
use of those resources are maintained independent of the Companyâs normal functions to ensure
the Monitorâs independence.

7. During the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor shall conduct an initial review
and two follow-up reviews and prepare an initial report and a first and second follow-up report,
and issue a Certification Report if appropriate, as described below.

Initial Review and Report

8. Promptly upon being retained, the Monitor shall prepare a written work plan,

which shall be submitted to the Company and the Commission staff for comment no later than

forty five (45) calendar days after being retained.
9. In order to conduct an effective initial review and to understand fully any existing
deficiencies in the Companyâs internal accounting controls and corporate compliance program,
the Monitorâs work plan shall include such steps as are reasonably necessary to understand the
Companyâs business and FCPA risks faced throughout its business. The steps shall include:

a. inspection of relevant documents, including the internal accounting
controls, record-keeping, and financial reporting policies and procedures
as they relate to the Companyâs compliance with the books and records,
internal accounting controls and anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA;

b. onsite observation of selected systems and procedures comprising the
Companyâs corporate compliance program, including anti-corruption
compliance procedures, internal accounting controls, record-keeping, due
diligence, and internal audit procedures, including at sample sites;

C. meetings with, and interviews of, relevant Company employees, officers,
directors, its third-party vendors, agents, or consultants and other persons
at mutually convenient times and places; and

d. risk-based analyses, studies and testing of the Companyâs corporate
compliance program.

10. The Monitor may take such steps as are reasonably necessary to develop an
understanding of the facts and circumstances surrounding prior FCPA violations that may have
occurred, but shall not conduct his or her own inquiry into those historical events.

11. The Company and Commission staff shall provide any comments concerning the

work plan within twenty five (25) calendar days in writing to the Monitor. Any disputes
between the Company and the Monitor with respect to the written work plan shall be decided by
the Commission staff in its sole discretion. Following comments by the Company and
Commission staff, the Monitor will have fifteen (15) calendar days to make revisions to the
initial work plan.

12. The initial review shall commence no later than ninety (90) calendar days from
the date of the engagement of the Monitor (unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the
Monitor, and the Commission staff). The Monitor shall issue a written report within one
hundred fifty (150) calendar days of commencing the initial review, setting forth the Monitorâs
assessment and, if necessary, making recommendations reasonably designed to improve the
effectiveness of the Companyâs internal accounting controls and corporate compliance program
as they relate to the Companyâs compliance with the anti-corruption laws. The Monitor should
consult with the Company concerning his or her findings and recommendations on an ongoing
basis and should consider the Companyâs comments and input to the extent the Monitor deems
appropriate. The Monitor may also choose to share a draft of his or her report with the Company
and Commission staff prior to finalizing them. The Monitor shall provide the report to the Board
of Directors of the Company and contemporaneously transmit a copy to Commission staff.

13. Within ninety (90) calendar days after receiving the Monitorâs initial report, the
Company shall adopt and implement all recommendations in the report, provided, however, that
as to any recommendation that the Company considers unduly burdensome, impractical or
costly, or inconsistent with applicable law or regulation, the Company need not adopt that

recommendation at that time, but may submit in writing to the Monitor and the Commission staff
within fifteen (15) days of receiving the report, an alternative policy, procedure, or system
designed to achieve the same objective or purpose.

14. In the event the Company and the Monitor are unable to agree on an acceptable
alternative proposal, the Company shall promptly consult with the Commission staff. Any
disputes between the Company and the Monitor with respect to the recommendations shall be
decided by the Commission staff in its sole discretion. The Commission staff may consider the
Monitorâs recommendation and the Companyâs reasons for not adopting the recommendation in
determining whether the Company has fully complied with its obligations. Pending such
determination, the Company shall not be required to implement any contested
recommendation(s).

15. With respect to any recommendation that the Monitor determines cannot
reasonably be implemented within ninety (90) calendar days after receiving the report, the
Monitor may extend the time period for implementation with prior written approval of the
Commission staff.

Follow-Up Reviews

16. The Monitor shall conduct a minimum of two Follow-Up Reviews. The Monitor
shall submit a written work plan for each follow-up review to the Company and Commission
staff within sixty (60) calendar days after the issuance of either the initial report, or the
applicable follow-up report. The Company and Commission staff shall provide any comments
concerning the work plan within fifteen (15) calendar days in writing to the Monitor. Any
disputes between the Company and the Monitor with respect to the written work plan shall be

decided by the Commission staff in its sole discretion. Following comments by the Company

6
and Commission staff, the Monitor will have fifteen (15) calendar days to make revisions to the

follow up work plan.

17. The Monitor shall commence the follow-up review pursuant to the work plan no
later than ninety (90) calendar days after the issuance of the initial report, or applicable follow-up
report, (unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the Monitor and the Commission staff). The
Monitor shall issue its written follow-up report within one hundred-twenty (120) calendar days
of commencing the follow-up review. The follow-up report shall set forth the Monitorâs
assessment of, and any additional recommendations regarding, the Companyâs internal
accounting controls and corporate compliance program as they relate to the Companyâs
compliance with the anti-corruption laws; the Monitorâs assessment of the implementation by the
Company of any recommendations made in the initial report, or follow-up report if applicable;
and the Monitorâs assessment of the commitment of the Companyâs Board of Directors and
senior management to compliance with the FCPA.

18. Within ninety (90) calendar days after receiving the Monitorâs follow-up report,
the Company shall adopt and implement all recommendations in the report, provided, however,
that as to any recommendation that the Company considers unduly burdensome, impractical or
costly, or inconsistent with applicable law or regulation, the Company need not adopt that
recommendation at that time, but may submit in writing to the Monitor and the Commission staff
within fifteen (15) days of receiving the report, an alternative policy, procedure, or system

designed to achieve the same objective or purpose.
19. In the event the Company and the Monitor are unable to agree on an acceptable
alternative proposal within fifteen (15) days, the Company shall promptly consult with the
Commission staff. Any disputes between the Company and the Monitor with respect to the
recommendations shall be decided by the Commission staff in its sole discretion. The
Commission staff may consider the Monitorâs recommendation and the Companyâs reasons for
not adopting the recommendation in determining whether the Company has fully complied with
its obligations. Pending such determination, the Company shall not be required to implement
any contested recommendation(s). The Monitor shall repeat the process of Follow-Up Reviews
until the terms in paragraph 21 (Certification of Compliance) or paragraphs 24-25 (Termination
or Extension of Monitorship) are met.

20. Throughout the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor shall disclose to the
Commission staff any credible evidence that corrupt or otherwise suspicious transactions
occurred, or payments of things of value were offered, promised, made or authorized by any
entity or person within the Company, or any entity or person working directly or indirectly for or
on behalf of the Company, or that related false books and records may have been maintained by
or on behalf of the Company. The Monitor shall contemporaneously notify the Companyâs
General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, or Audit Committee for further action unless at the
Monitorâs discretion he or she believes disclosure to the Company would be inappropriate under
the circumstances. The Monitor shall address in his or her reports the appropriateness of the
Companyâs response to all improper activities, whether previously disclosed to the Commission

staff or not.
Certification of Compliance

21. At the conclusion of the ninety (90) calendar day period following the issuance of
the second follow-up report, or later follow-up report if applicable, if the Monitor believes that
the Companyâs compliance program is reasonably designed and implemented to detect and
prevent violations of the anti-corruption laws and is functioning effectively, the Monitor shall
certify the Companyâs compliance with its compliance obligations under the Order. The Monitor
shall then submit to the Commission staff a written report (âCertification Reportâ) within sixty
(60) calendar days. The Certification Report shall set forth an overview of the Companyâs
remediation efforts to date, including the implementation status of the Monitorâs
recommendations, and an assessment of the sustainability of the Companyâs remediation efforts.
The Certification Report should also recommend the scope of the Companyâs future self-
reporting. Also at the conclusion of the ninety (90) calendar day period following the issuance
of the second follow-up report, the Company shall certify in writing to the Commission staff,
with a copy to the Monitor, that the Company has adopted and implemented all of the Monitorâs
recommendations in the initial and follow-up report(s), or the agreed-upon alternatives. The
Monitor or the Company may extend the time period for issuance of the Certification Report or
the Companyâs certification, respectively, with prior written approval of the Commission staff.

Self-Reporting Period

22. At such time as the Commission staff approves the Certification Report and the
Companyâs certification, the monitorship shall be terminated, and the Company will be permitted
to self-report to the Commission staff on its enhanced compliance obligations for the remainder

of the term of the Order. The Commission staff, however, reserves the right to terminate the
monitorship absent certification by the Monitor, upon a showing by the Company that
termination is, nevertheless, in the interests of justice.

23. If permitted to self-report to the Commission staff, the Company shall thereafter
submit to the commission staff a written report after seven (7) months setting forth a complete
description of its remediation efforts to date, its proposals to improve the Companyâs internal
accounting controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with the anti-corruption
laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent reviews. The Company shall disclose any
credible evidence that corrupt or otherwise suspicious transactions occurred, or payments of
things of value were offered, promised, or provided to foreign officials, that it learns of that
occurred after the date of this Consent. The Company may extend the time period for issuance
of the self-report with prior written approval of the Commission staff.

Termination or Extension of the Monitorship

24. If at the conclusion of the ninety (90) calendar-day period following the issuance
of the second follow-up report, or later follow-up report if applicable, the Commission staff
concludes in its sole discretion that the Company has not by that time successfully satisfied its
compliance obligations under the Order, the Term of the Monitorship shall be extended for nine
(9) months. Under such circumstances, the Monitor shall commence the Follow-Up Reviews in
accordance with Paragraphs 16-19.

25. If at the conclusion of the thirty-six (36) month period the Commission staff
concludes the Company has not met its obligations under the Order, the Commission staff in its

sole discretion may extend the Monitorship or Self-Reporting requirements up to forty-eight (48)

10
months from the issuance of the Order, and require reporting as set forth for Follow-Up Reviews
or Self-Reporting.
Extensions of Time
26. Upon request by the Monitor or the Company, the Commission staff may extend
any procedural time period set forth above for good cause shown.
Confidentiality of Reports
27. The reports submitted by the Monitor and the periodic reviews and reports
submitted by the Company will likely include confidential financial, proprietary, competitive
business or commercial information. Public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations or undermine the objectives
of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the contents
thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except (1) pursuant to court order,
(11) as agreed to by the parties in writing, (111) to the extent that the Commission determines in its
sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commissionâs discharge of its
duties and responsibilities, or (iv) is otherwise required by law.
Address for All Written Communications and Reports
28. All reports or other written communications by the Monitor or the Company
directed to the Commission staff shall be transmitted to the Chief of the FCPA Unit and to Tracy
L. Price, Assistant Director, Division of Enforcement, U.S. Securities and Exchange

Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC. 20549.

LAN Airlines Settles FCPA Charges

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2016-151

Washington D.C., july 25, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that South American-based LAN Airlines has
agreed to pay more than $22 million to settle parallel civil and criminal cases related to improper payments it authorized during a dispute
between the airline and its union employees in Argentina.

An SEC investigation found that when LAN encountered problems negotiating labor agreements with the unions, it was contacted by a
consultant from Argentina who offered to negotiate on the companyâs behalf. The consultant made clear that he would expect compensation
for such negotiations, and that payments would be made to third parties who had influence over the unions. LANâs CEO approved $1.15
million in payments to the consultant through a sham contract for a purported study of existing air routes in Argentina. The CEO knew that
no actual study would be performed and that it was possible the consultant would pass some portion of the money to union officials in
Argentina to settle the wage disputes.

To settle the SECâs charges that it failed to keep accurate books and records and maintain adequate internal accounting controls, LAN agreed
to pay $9.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. In a deferred prosecution agreement announced today by the U.S.
Department of Justice, LAN agreed to pay a $12.75 million penalty.

Earlier this year, the SEC charged LANâs CEO Ignacio Cueto Plaza with FCPA violations and he settled the charges.

âLAN used a sham consulting agreement to make its financial reporting appear as though the company was funding a study rather than
steering money to settle labor disputes,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âThis settlement along
with our prior case against the CEO shows that public companies and their executives must be truthful and forthcoming about its overseas
consulting agreements or otherwise pay the consequences.â

Under the settlement, LAN must retain an independent compliance monitor for a period of not less than 27 months. In reaching the
settlement, the SEC considered LANâs remedial acts and general cooperation with the investigation.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Denise Hansberry and Tracy L. Price of the FCPA Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the
Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.

In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS, PURSUANT
TO SECTION 21C OF THE

SAP SE, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
Respondent. IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST
ORDER

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) against SAP SE (âSAPâ or
Respondentâ).

II.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the entry of this
Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (the âOrderâ),
as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ) by SAP SE (âSAPâ), a
European Union corporation headquartered in Waldorf, Germany. The violations occurred due
to deficient internal controls, which allowed SAPâs former Vice-President of Global and
Strategic Accounts, Vicente E. Garcia, to discount the software price to a former SAP local
partner at a level sufficient to permit Garcia and the local partner to pay $145,000 in bribes to
one senior Panamanian government official, and offer bribes to two others. Through these
bribes, Garcia secured government sales contracts of approximately $3.7 million for SAP, and
also self-profited through kickbacks. By excessively discounting the SAP software, Garcia
created a slush fund that the partner used to pay the bribes and kickbacks. Garcia concealed his
scheme from others at SAP, circumvented SAPâs internal controls, and justified the excessive
discounts by falsifying SAPâs internal approval forms.

2. The deep discounts that Garcia used to create the slush fund were falsely recorded
as legitimate discounts on the books of SAPâs Mexican subsidiary, which were subsequently
consolidated into SAPâs financial statements. In addition, SAP failed to devise and maintain an
adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
these improper payments to government officials did not occur.

Respondent

3. SAP SE (âSAPâ) is a European Union corporation headquartered in Waldorf,
Germany. SAPâs American Depository Shares are registered with the Commission pursuant to
Section 12(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. SAP
markets its software all over the world through various country subsidiaries.

Related Individual and Entities

4. Vicente E. Garcia is a U.S. citizen residing in Miami, Florida. Garcia was SAPâs
Vice-President of Global and Strategic Accounts, responsible for sales in Latin America for SAP
from February 2008 until April 2014, when SAP terminated Garcia for his misconduct described
herein.

5. SAP International, Inc. (ââSAPIâ), a Miami, Florida-based wholly-owned
subsidiary of SAP, is engaged in selling software in the Latin American and Caribbean markets.
SAPI does not enter into direct or indirect software or software-related services deals with end
customers. Instead, SAPI employs some of the members of the Latin America and Caribbean
(âLACâ) regional leadership team and provides some back office operational support for some of
the LAC regional subsidiaries. Garcia was on the payroll of SAPI.

 

6. SAP Mexico S.A. de C.V. (âSAP Mexicoâ) is a Mexico City, Mexico-based
wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP engaged in selling software in the Mexican and Central
American markets. SAP Mexico is authorized by SAP to distribute, sell, license, and sublicense
software directly and indirectly to end customers. Garcia negotiated the Panamanian contracts
on behalf of SAP Mexico. SAP Mexicoâs financial statements are consolidated and reported in
SAPâs financial statements.
Facts

A. Background

7. SAP, through its 272 subsidiaries, sells software licenses and related services to
263,000 customers in 188 countries. SAPâs global business is directed and operated from its
headquarters in Waldorf, Germany and executed through its numerous subsidiaries. SAPâs
business is conducted through a network of more than 11,500 partners worldwide that provide an
additional workforce of 380,000 individuals skilled in SAP software solutions and technology.
SAPâs sales using a local partner can be either (i) a direct sale to a customer with a sales
commission paid to a partner that provides assistance, (11) an indirect sale through a partner that
purchases the software license and resells it to a customer at an independently determined
increased price, or (iii) a direct sale to the partner, which acts as a distributor and independently
resells the software licenses to customers in the future.

8. From 2008 to April 2014, Garcia served as SAPâs Vice-President of Global and
Strategic Accounts and was responsible for sales in Latin America for SAP. Although Garcia
was technically employed by SAPI, SAP presented him to customers as an SAP employee and
his supervisors included employees of SAPI (from January 16, 2010 to April 10, 2014), SAPâs
Brazilian subsidiary (from February 25, 2008 to January 15, 2010), and indirectly SAP
(throughout the relevant time period).

9. In June 2009, SAP conducted an internal investigation and found that Garcia
violated its internal Code of Business Conduct when he invited an executive of Petroleos
Mexicanos (âPEMEXââ), the Mexican national oil company, to an SAP marketing event at the
Monaco Grand Prix. SAP did not find any attempt to improperly influence any government
official in connection with the 2008 PEMEX sale. As a result of the internal investigation, SAP
revised its policies prohibiting government officials or employees from attending any
âhospitalityâ event, which it defined as any event where business constitutes less than 80% of the
event.

B. Garcia Bribed Government Officials in Panama to Obtain Business for SAP

10. Garcia continued working for SAP, and from at least June 2009 to November
2013, he along with others outside of SAP, planned and executed a bribery scheme in Panama, as
described below.

11. In June 2009, Garciaâs business associate, a Panamanian lobbyist (the
âLobbyistâ), informed Garcia about potential software sales opportunities with the government
of Panama and that he had an existing relationship with the newly elected government, including
a high ranking Government Official A, who was tasked with improving technology solutions
across multiple government agencies in Panama and had significant influence over Panamaâs
software purchasing decisions. Around the same time, SAP independently began investigating
possible software sales to the Panamanian government. Initially the overall SAP endeavor was
led by local SAP sales employees in Mexico and Panama. Garcia, however, took over the
business opportunity by recommending that SAP designate the Panama government as part of
the Premier Customer Network â a group of large, strategically important, regional customers â
that Garcia headed.

12. Garcia and others outside of SAP were informed by the Lobbyist that in order to
obtain contracts from the government of Panama, they needed to bribe three Panamanian
government officials that had significant influence in the Panamanian governmentâs award of
contracts to purchase software.

13. In anticipation of the sales to the government of Panama, Garcia and others
outside of SAP began planning the details of the bribery scheme. On June 9 and 10, 2010,
Garcia discussed with others, including via personal e-mail, their plans to pay bribes to
Government Official A (2% of the value of the contract) and Government Official B (10%), and
receive kickbacks for themselves (2%). Also, on October 26, 2010, e-mails were exchanged
with two attached spreadsheets referencing planned payments to Government Officials A and C
of approximately $100,000 and $300,000, respectively.

14. One of the four contracts was a software license sale to the Panamanian social
security agency, which was initially proposed to be a direct sale with the assistance of local
partners. In order to facilitate the bribery scheme, the existing partners were replaced with a new
local Panamanian partner. This last-minute change, and other red flags, triggered an SAP
compliance review which resulted in SAP rejecting Garciaâs request to pay a commission to the
local partner. Therefore, Garcia and others began looking for other ways to advance the bribery
scheme. Finally, in the fall of 2010, Garcia finalized an indirect sale of the software license to
the agency through the local partner, who, with Garciaâs assistance, ultimately sought and
obtained an 82% discount on SAPâs sale price to the local partner. Garcia caused various
approval forms to be submitted that misstated the reasons for the large discount. Garcia stated
that the discounts were necessary to compete with other software companies in establishing a
relationship with the government of Panama when, in fact, the discounts were necessary to fund
and pay bribes to government officials. Garcia and others planned to sell SAP software to the
local partner at an 82% discount, who in turn would sell the software at significantly higher
prices to the Panamanian government and use part of the profits from the sale to pay bribes.

15. Garcia, as a senior vice-president of SAP responsible for sales in Latin America,
used his knowledge of the availability of discounts to push through large discounts in order to
create a slush fund from which the local partner was able to pay the bribes. SAP routinely
provides large discounts to local partners for legitimate reasons that Garcia used to justify the
illegitimate discounts. Once Garcia obtained approval of the discounts based on his falsified
justification forms, the bribes were then paid from the local partner.

16. SAP agreed to sell the software licenses for the Panamanian social security
agency to the local partner for approximately $2.1 million, an 82% discount. In November 2010,
the local partner successfully bid $14.5 million for a contract, which included SAP software. On
January 31, 2011, the Panamanian government awarded the contract to the local partner. Garcia,
along with others, planned to pay bribes to Panamanian government officials from the proceeds
of the software sale to the government of Panama.
17. Thereafter, between June 2012 and December 2013, the Panamanian government
awarded three additional contracts that included SAP software products valued at approximately
$13.5 million, which were also sold at deep discounts by SAP to its local partner. For these
contracts also, Garcia and others outside of SAP agreed to pay bribes to Panamanian officials
from the proceeds of the software sales.

18. As aresult of Garciaâs conduct in the bribery scheme, SAP, with its local partner,
was able to sell software to the Panamanian government through four contracts from 2010 to
2013. These contracts generated revenues of approximately $3.7 million to SAP.

19. The deep discounts that Garcia used to create the slush fund were falsely recorded
as legitimate discounts on the books of SAP Mexico, which were subsequently consolidated into
SAPâs financial statements.

SAPâs Insufficient Internal Controls

20. SAP lacked adequate internal controls to ensure that discounts to local partners
were not improperly used. SAPâs system required employees to electronically submit requests
within SAP to obtain approval of discounts to local partners. SAP employees, however, had
wide latitude in seeking and approving discounts to local partners, and employeesâ explanations
for the discounts were accepted without verification. There were also no requirements for
heightened anti-corruption scrutiny for large discounts. Garcia was therefore able to evade the
basic approval procedures by taking advantage of his position and his knowledge of how
discounts were approved. Furthermore, the nature of Garciaâs reporting structure made it easy
for him to implement the bribery scheme. Although Garcia was located in Miami and employed
by SAPI, he variously reported to supervisors employed by other regional subsidiaries and used
employees from other subsidiaries such as SAP Mexico to execute the sales to the Panamanian
government. This indirect reporting structure at SAP created gaps in supervising Garcia that
provided him the opportunity to use the large discounts for creating a slush fund for bribes.
Because of the deficient controls, Garcia was able to provide the partner with deep enough
discounts to enable him to implement the bribery scheme, which continued unabated for over
four years.

SAPâs Cooperation and Remediation

21. | When SAP learned of the conduct as a result of the SECâs inquiry, SAP
conducted a thorough internal investigation and extensively cooperated with the SECâs
investigation by, among other things: (1) conducting an internal investigation; (11) voluntarily
producing approximately 500,000 pages of documents and other information quickly, identifying
significant documents and translating documents from Spanish; (111) conducting witness
interviews, sharing Power-Point presentations and timelines; (iv) facilitating an interview of
Garcia at work at SAPI offices in Miami without alerting him to the investigation into his
conduct; and (v) initiating a third party audit of the local partner.

22. After being alerted to Garciaâs misconduct, SAP terminated Garcia and undertook
remediation efforts to uncover any other possible misconduct and to improve its FCPA
compliance. Specifically, SAP audited all recent public sector Latin American transactions,

5
regardless of Garciaâs involvement, to analyze partner profit margin data especially in
comparison to discounts so that any trends could be spotted and high profit margin transactions
could be identified for further investigation and audit. SAP also implemented new policies and
procedures to detect and prevent similar issues from recurring in the future. For example, SAP
elevated the status of its Chief Compliance Officer (âCCOâ) by having that person now report
directly to the CFO, who is a member of the Executive Board, and gave the CCO authority to
independently terminate employees and partner contracts. SAP conducted, and continues to
conduct, regular anti-corruption training, as well as anti-corruption audits through its internal
audit function.

23. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.

Legal Standards and Violations

24. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires every issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act âto make and keep books,
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.â

25. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires every issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to devise and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that, among other
things, transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific
authorization; transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other applicable
criteria; transactions are recorded as necessary to maintain accountability for assets; and access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization.

26. As aresult of the conduct described above, the discounts used to fund the bribe
payments were misrecorded in SAP Mexicoâs books and records as legitimate discounts to a
local partner. SAP Mexicoâs books and records were consolidated into SAPâs books and
records. Based on the foregoing, SAP violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.

27. SAP also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to devise
and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls relating to approving and
granting discounts to local partners. As described herein, SAP lacked effective internal controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that discounts provided to local partners were not
being used to pay bribes.

Findings

28. Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that SAP violated Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent SAPâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent SAP cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

B. Respondent shall pay disgorgement of $3,700,000, representing ill-gotten gains
received in connection with the bribery scheme, and prejudgment interest of $188,896 to the
Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States
Treasury subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). Payment shall be made within ten (10)
days of the date of this Order. If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue
pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.

Payments must be made in one of the following ways:

(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which shall
provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through
the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United States
postal money order, payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or
mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying SAP as
the Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the
cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Alka N. Patel, Assistant Regional
Director, Division of Enforcement, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 444 South
Flower Street, Suite 900, Los Angeles, California 90071.

C. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty
based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation and related enforcement action. If at
any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement (âDivisionâ) obtains
information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided materially false or misleading
information or materials to the Commission, or in a related proceeding, the Division may, at its
sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to reopen this
matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay a civil money penalty. Respondent
may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether it knowingly
provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1) contest the findings in the
Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to, any statute of
limitations defense.

SEC Charges Software Company With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2016-17

Washington D.C., Feb. 1, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that software manufacturer SAP SE has agreed
to give up $3.7 million in sales profits to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when procuring business in
Panama.

An SEC investigation found that SAPâs deficient internal controls allowed a former SAP executive to pay $145,000 in bribes to a senior
Panamanian government official and offer bribes to two others in exchange for lucrative sales contracts. The SEC charged the SAP executive,
Vicente E. Garcia, in a separate enforcement action last year that included a parallel criminal action. Garcia has been sentenced to 22
months in prison.

âSAPâs internal controls failed to flag Garciaâs misconduct as he easily falsified internal approval forms and disguised his bribes as discounts,â
said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:
e SAP is headquartered in Germany and executes most of its sales through a network of worldwide corporate partners, including a
partner in Panama.

e The bribery scheme involved providing large discounts of up to 82 percent to SAPâs Panamanian partner, who used the excessive
discounts to create a slush fund out of which to pay bribes to Panamanian officials on Garciaâs behalf so SAP could sell software.

e SAP had no requirements for heightened anti-corruption scrutiny for such large discounts.

e SAP falsely recorded the slush fund as legitimate discounts on the books of SAPâs Mexican subsidiary, and the figures were
subsequently consolidated into SAPâs financial statements.

e SAP failed to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls to provide reasonable assurances that the
discounts were recorded in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The SECâs order finds that SAP violated the internal controls provisions and the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Without admitting
or denying the findings, SAP consented to the entry of the cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $3.7 million in profits
from SAP's software sales to the Panamanian government plus prejudgment interest of $188,896. The settlement reflects SAPâs cooperation
and remedial measures.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Ansu Banerjee and supervised by Alka Patel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S.
Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California, and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
SA/NV, FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-

Respondent.

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be and hereby are instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) against Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (âAB InBevâ or

Respondentâ).
Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. This matter concerns AB InBevâs violations of the books and records and internal
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), which occurred at its
Indian wholly owned subsidiary, Crown Beers India Private Limited (âCrownâ). From 2009 to
2012, AB InBev held a 49% interest in an Indian joint venture, InBev India International Private
Limited (âTIPLâ), which managed the marketing and distribution of Crown beer. During this
period, II[PL used third-party sales promoters to make improper payments to Indian government
officials to obtain beer orders and to increase brewery hours for Crown in 2011. IIIPL invoiced
Crown for reimbursement for certain of these expenses, and Crown paid or accrued them. In doing
so, Crown recorded certain of these expenses in its books as legitimate promotional costs. During
this period, Crown had inadequate internal accounting controls to detect and prevent these
improper payments and to ensure that transactions involving these promoters were recorded
properly in its books. As a result, Crownâs books, which were consolidated into AB InBevâs books
and records, did not accurately and fairly reflect the nature of the promotersâ transactions.

2. Furthermore, in December 2012, AB InBev entered into a separation agreement
with a former Crown employee containing language that impeded the employee from
communicating directly with the Commission staff about possible securities law violations. AB
InBev had also used the same or similar language in other separation agreements in the past.

Respondent

3. AB InBev, a global brewer, is a Belgian company headquartered in Leuven,
Belgium. AB InBev was formed in November 2008 through the merger of Anheuser-Busch
Companies Inc. (âAnheuser-Buschâ) and InBev SA/NV (âInBevâ). AB InBevâs American
Depositary Receipts trade on the New York Stock Exchange and have been registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act since September 16, 2009. AB InBev
has, through various direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates, approximately 155,000
employees based in 25 countries around the world. AB InBev files annual reports with the
Commission on Form 20-F.

Other Relevant Entities

4. Crown is a wholly owned subsidiary of AB InBev and is headquartered in
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. Crownâs financial results are consolidated into AB InBevâs
financial statements, which are filed with the Commission.

 

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
5. IIIPL, a defunct company formerly based in Gurgaon, India, was a joint venture
between AB InBev and RJ Corp, an Indian corporation. InBev (AB InBevâs predecessor) and RJ
Corp formed II[PL in 2007 to brew and sell beer in India and Nepal. Prior to its dissolution in
early 2015, RJ Corp and AB InBev owned 51% and 49% of IIIPL, respectively. AB InBev and RJ
Corp each had the right to appoint four IIIPL directors, with RJ Corp having the right to appoint
the Chairman, who cast the tie-breaking vote on all but certain specified matters. RJ Corp
appointed the II[PL CEO, who had the power to appoint the other members of the II[PL
management team, except for the CFO, whom AB InBev appointed. Throughout the relevant
period, the top financial officer at Crown acted as the top financial officer at IIIPL. From mid-
2011 through early 2014, Crownâs in-house counsel also acted as II[PLâs in-house counsel.

Facts
A. Background
6. AB InBevâs predecessor corporate entities, Anheuser-Busch and InBev,

independently entered the Indian beer market before the two companies merged in November
2008. Anheuser-Busch entered the Indian market in 2007 through a joint venture with Crown and
subsequently bought out its partner, making Crown a wholly owned subsidiary. InBev entered the
Indian market in 2007 through II[PL. Post-merger, AB InBev continued to operate in India
through both Crown and IIIPL.

7. Pre-merger, Crown controlled the marketing, distribution, and sale of the beer it
brewed. The Anheuser-Busch/InBev merger, however, triggered a provision in the IIIPL joint
venture shareholdersâ agreement that required IIIPL to manage the marketing, distribution, and sale
of beer brewed by Crown. Thereafter, IPL controlled the third-party sales promoters that were
used to facilitate the sale and marketing of Crownâs beers in both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
Among other tasks, these promoters administered retail promotional programs and liaised with
Indian state government authorities.

8. The sale of beer in India is predominantly regulated by individual states. In the
state of Andhra Pradesh, the Andhra Pradesh Beverages Corporation Limited (âAPBCLâ), an
instrumentality of the government of Andhra Pradesh, purchases beer directly from brewers and
sells beer directly to private retailers. In the state of Tamil Nadu, the Tamil Nadu State Marketing
Corporation (ââTASMACââ), an instrumentality of the government of Tamil Nadu, controls both
wholesale and retail beer sales, purchasing beer from brewers and selling to consumers through
TASMAC retail outlets.

B. Third-Party Promoters of AB InBevâs and IIIPLâs Beers Provided Improper Benefits
and Payments to Indian Government Officials

9. In early 2009, IIIPLâs CEO and his appointed executives formulated a plan to
increase IIIPLâs market share in Andhra Pradesh by providing improper benefits and payments to
government officials through third-party sales promoters.
Promoter Company A

 

10. In 2009, IIPL hired a promoter for the state of Andhra Pradesh, Promoter
Company A. Promoter Company A had no experience in the alcohol industry. Promoter
Company A received excessive commissions and reimbursements for questionable promotional
charges. For example, Promoter Company A sought reimbursement from IIIPL of certain
âdisplayâ charges that had no substantiation and were billed on a âper caseâ basis rather than based
on the actual amount spent on the display. Promoter Company A used these excessive
commissions and reimbursements to make improper payments to government officials at APBCL.

11. There was no executed contract in place to govern the relationship between
Promoter Company A and IIIPL. Neither HIPL nor Crown conducted any due diligence on
Promoter Company A. Instead, the contractual terms of IIIPLâs agreement with Promoter
Company A were documented only in two short internal emails between IIIPL employees.
Promoter Company A was replaced by a successor entity in April 2012, but neither IIIPL nor
Crown conducted any due diligence on the successor entity at that time. Even though Crownâs in-
house counsel forwarded AB InBevâs FCPA due diligence forms to IIIPL staff and offered to help
complete them, the due diligence forms were never completed. Neither company executed a
written contract with the successor entity until September 2012.

12. In December 2009, AB InBev received an internal complaint regarding compliance
and internal control issues at IIIPL, including potential FCPA issues related to Promoter
Company A. In response, AB InBev expedited an already-planned internal audit of IIIPL, which
AB InBev staff conducted in early 2010. This audit did not scrutinize Promoter Company Aâs
activities or expenses. Still, the 2010 audit identified various deficiencies at IPL, including
(a) a lack of documented business policies and procedures for significant functions such as
procurement, vendor selection, and expense reimbursement; (b) a lack of awareness about FCPA
compliance; and (c) inadequate information technology controls regarding financial processes and
expense payments. AB InBev did not rectify many of the issues identified in the audit until 2011
or early 2012.

13. From April 2009 until March 2012, IPL generally incurred the initial costs of
marketing and selling Crownâs beer and then sent invoices to Crown for reimbursement. Crown,
in turn, recorded certain of these costs as expenses on its books and records. Crown thus either
incurred or accrued certain of Promoter Company Aâs expenses and recorded them as legitimate
commissions or promotional costs, even though some of those amounts included improper
payments to government officials.

14. Despite the internal complaint and the 2010 audit results, Crown personnel did not
verify that a contract was in place with Promoter Company A and did not ensure that IIIPL
personnel had performed due diligence on Promoter Company A. As a result, Crown recorded
certain Promoter Company A expenses on its books in a manner that failed to accurately and fairly
reflect their true nature and purpose.
Promoter Company B

 

15. In or about 2011, IMPL began working with an individual (the âPrincipalâ) who had
connections in Andhra Pradesh, including to the son-in-law of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Minister.
The Principal used his local connections to secure extra brewing hours for Crown after the Andhra
Pradesh Excise Commissioner limited Crownâs production time to 8 hours per day. On April 1,
2011, before the Principal was hired in any capacity by HIPL or Crown, and before the Principal
had entered into any contract, the Principal emailed HIPL a signed order from the Andhra Pradesh
Excise Commissioner that gave Crown an additional 7.5 brewing hours per day. The Principal
helped HIPL obtain further authorizations from the Andhra Pradesh Excise Commissioner to
operate for an additional 7.5 hours per day in May 2011, and an additional 7 hours per day in June
2011. Neither IIIPL nor Crown held any contractual relationship with, or had performed any due
diligence on, the Principal when he helped secure the additional brewing hours.

16. Around the same time, II[PL engaged the Principal to assist in generating beer
orders from TASMAC in Tamil Nadu. In April 2011, the Principal secured orders of more than
534,000 cases of beer in Tamil Nadu, resulting in gross profits of approximately $637,000 to
Crown. This was the first and only time that HIPL ever sold Crown beer in Tamil Nadu.

17. IMPL utilized the Principalâs company, Promoter Company B, to promote beer in
Tamil Nadu despite the fact that Promoter Company B had no experience, staff, or infrastructure in
Tamil Nadu.

18. IIIPL personnel did not conduct due diligence on the Principal or Promoter
Company B before they began performing work for HIPL. To conceal this fact, IIIPL employees
subsequently completed and backdated Promoter Company Bâs due diligence forms to make it
appear as though they were completed in April 2011, when HIPL initially engaged Promoter
Company B. In addition, [IPL employees allowed the Principal to complete the due diligence
forms in the first instance, and then altered his responses to make them more suitable.

19. Neither Crown nor II[PL had a written agreement in place with the Principal or
Promoter Company B. Rather, the basic terms of the engagement were first set out in an internal
email between IIIPL employees in June 2011, several months after ITIIPL had begun to sell beer in
Tamil Nadu and after Promoter Company B had already invoiced IIIPL for its services. The terms
included an inflated commission rate, which Promoter Company B used to make improper
payments to TASMAC officials. II[PL employees subsequently drafted and backdated a contract
with Promoter Company B to create the appearance that the contract had been executed on the date
that IIIPL initially engaged Promoter Company B. In reality, HIPL did not execute a formal
contract with Promoter Company B until approximately January 2012.

20. Although they were on notice of internal controls issues at IPL and had received a
complaint about the Principal and Promoter Company B, Crown personnel did not verify the
existence of a written contract with Promoter Company B and did not confirm that IIIPL personnel
performed due diligence on Promoter Company B.
Cc. AB InBevâs Separation Agreement Contained Language that Impeded the Crown
Employeeâs Communication with the Commission

21. In 2010 and 2011, a Crown employee (the âCrown Employeeâ) informed AB
InBev personnel that, among other things, IPL may have been using Promoter Company A to
make improper payments to government officials. The Crown Employee also raised concerns to
AB InBev about Promoter Company B, questioning its lack of sales experience, staff, and
infrastructure. The Crown Employee reported to AB InBev personnel that the Principal had a local
reputation for âtaking care ofâ government officials and suggested that AB InBev perform due
diligence on him.

22. During the relevant period, the Crown Employee was employed by an AB InBev
subsidiary.

23. In early 2012, AB InBevâs subsidiary terminated the Crown Employeeâs
employment. The Crown Employee and AB InBevâs subsidiary subsequently engaged in
mediation regarding potential employment law claims related to this termination. In late 2012, the
Crown Employee and AB InBevâs subsidiary entered into a Confidential Agreement and General
Release (the âSeparation Agreementâ) that resolved the Crown Employeeâs claims.

24. Paragraph 7.A of the Separation Agreement includes the following language:

[The Crown Employee] agrees to Keep in strict secrecy and confidence
any and all unique, confidential and/or proprietary information and
material belonging or relating to [the AB InBev subsidiary] that is not a
matter of common knowledge or otherwise generally available to the
public including, but not limited to, business, government affairs,
communications, financial, trade, technical or technological information.
[The Crown Employee] acknowledges and agrees that [the Crown
Employee] remains subject to the âEmployment Agreement as to
Intellectual Property and Confidentiality,â which [the Crown Employee]
previously signed and is incorporated into the Agreement by reference.

25. Paragraph 7.C of the Separation Agreement includes the following language:

[The Crown Employee] agrees not to disclose, directly or indirectly, any
information regarding the substance of this Agreement to any person
other than [the Crown Employeeâs] spouse, attorney, or financial or tax
advisor, except to the extent such disclosure may be required for
accounting or tax purposes or as otherwise required by law.

26. Paragraph 7.D of the Separation Agreement includes the following language:

[The Crown Employee] agrees that, if [the Crown Employee] violates in
any way any of the terms and conditions of paragraph 7, [the Crown
Employee] shall be liable to [the AB InBev subsidiary], and shall

6
immediately pay to [the AB InBev subsidiary] as liquidated damages and
not as a penalty, the total sum of $250,000.00 which represents
reasonable compensation for the loss incurred by [the AB InBev
subsidiary] as a result of such breach....

27. After signing the Separation Agreement, the Crown Employee, who was previously
voluntarily communicating directly with the Commission staff, stopped doing so. The Crown
Employee stopped doing so because he believed that he was prohibited by the recently executed
Separation Agreement and any violation of the Separation Agreement would risk triggering the
Separation Agreementâs liquidated damages provision. Only after the Commission issued an
administrative subpoena for testimony and documents did the Crown Employee resume
communicating directly with the Commission staff.

28. AB InBev has used the same or similar language in other agreements in the past.
Document Destruction at IPL

29. In or about May 2013, Commission staff learned of TIPLâs plans to destroy or hide
documents. The Commission staff informed AB InBev immediately thereafter, but the company
took no immediate corrective action. In September 2013, AB InBev notified the Commission staff
of a meeting in which several HIPL managers instructed top HIPL employees to remove potentially
inculpatory data from their offices and computers. Crown and HIPLâs in-house counsel attended
the meeting, but never alerted AB InBev management to the document removal instructions. Other
IIIPL employees reported that they had helped or observed HIPL managers take several binders out
of the building to destroy or move to a âsecret location.â

AB InBevâs Investigation and Remedial Efforts

30. AB InBev did not report the 2009 and 2011 complaints to the Commission staff
before the Commission first contacted AB InBev in October 2011. During the investigation, AB
InBev did not respond to subpoenas in a timely manner, and made broad assertions of privilege
that required significant resources from the Commission staff to address and delayed the
production of responsive, non-privileged documents. The timeliness of AB InBevâs responses to
the Commissionâs requests for documents and information improved over time.

31. After the 2010 internal audit, AB InBev did improve some internal controls at
Crown and INPL, including by adopting AB InBevâs own policies, due diligence questionnaires,
and checklists; more sound controls over expenses and cash; and tighter controls over HIPLâs
accounting software, and the eventual replacement in 2012 of a flawed accounting system with a
more sophisticated system. However, IIIPL employees were still able to circumvent many of these
controls between 2010 and 2012. AB InBev also conducted FCPA training at both IIIPL and
Crown, albeit over a year and a half after it received the first complaint regarding potential FCPA
violations.

32. Additionally, AB InBev and RJ Corp terminated their joint venture and dissolved
IIIPL in early 2015. AB InBev now operates in India solely through its wholly owned subsidiary,

7
Crown, and has consolidated its Indian production, sales, and marketing functions at Crown.
Following the dissolution of IIIPL in 2015, AB InBev conducted extensive FCPA training for
Crownâs staff, and implemented improved compliance policies and controls at Crown, including
policies and controls relating to third-party due diligence and contracts. AB InBev also has hired a
dedicated India compliance manager who reports to a new India Legal Counsel and Head of
Compliance.

33. In September 2015, AB InBev amended its separation agreements that impose
confidentiality restrictions on departing employees of its United States entities to make clear that
they do not prohibit the employees from reporting possible violations of law to governmental
agencies. Those separation agreements now include the following language: âI understand and
acknowledge that notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, I am not prohibited or in
any way restricted from reporting possible violations of law to a governmental agency or entity,
and I am not required to inform the Company if I make such reports.â

Legal Standards and Violations

34. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was,
or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have
known would contribute to such violation.

35. Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, issuers are required to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer.

36. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers with a class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that, among other things,
transactions are (a) executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific authorization;
(b) recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles or any other applicable criteria; and (c) recorded as
necessary to maintain accountability for assets; and access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with managementâs general or specific authorization.

37. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on July
21, 2010, amended the Exchange Act by adding Section 21F, âWhistleblower Incentives and
Protection.â The Commission adopted Rule 21F-17(a), which provides that, âNo person may take
any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with the Commission staff about
a possible securities law violation, including enforcing, or threatening to enforce, a confidentiality
agreement... with respect to such communications.â Rule 21F-17(a) became effective on August
12, 2011.
38. As a result of the conduct described above, AB InBev violated Section 13(b)(2)(A)
of the Exchange Act, because its books and records did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the true nature and purpose of Promoter Company Aâs illicit expenses.

39. AB InBev also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that Crown executed transactions in accordance with managementâs general or specific
authorization.

40. In addition, AB InBev violated Rule 21F-17(a) because the Separation Agreement
contained language that impeded the Crown Employee from communicating directly with the
Commission staff. Such restrictions on providing information regarding possible securities law
violations to the Commission undermine the purpose of Section 21F, which is to âencourage[e]
individuals to report to the Commissionâ [Adopting Release at p. 201], and violate Rule 21F-17(a)
by impeding individuals from communicating directly with the Commission staff about possible
securities law violations.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent AB InBevâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent shall cease and desist

B. Respondent shall, within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, pay
disgorgement of $2,712,955, prejudgment interest of $292,381, and a civil penalty of $3,002,955,
for a total payment of $6,008,291 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the
general fund of the United States Treasury in accordance with Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3).

If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice
600 and 31 U.S.C. Â§ 3717.

term, Respondent agrees to cooperate fully and truthfully, when directed by the Commission, in
an official investigation or proceeding by the United States Department of Justice into potential

(1) producing, in a responsive and prompt manner, all non-privileged
documents, information, and other materials to the Commission as
requested by the Commissionâs staff, wherever located, in the possession,

(2) using its best efforts to secure the full, truthful, and continuing cooperation

provision of testimony in the investigation, trial and other judicial
proceedings in connection with the Proceedings or Other Proceedings; and

(3) entering into tolling agreements, when requested to do so by the

D. During a two-year term as set forth below, Respondent shall report to the

person while working directly for Respondent, to any government official; (2) that related false
books and records have been maintained; or (3) that Respondentâs internal controls failed to detect

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

year of the entry of this Order on the operation of AB InBevâs FCPA and
anti-corruption compliance program (the âInitial Reportâ). The Initial
Report shall be transmitted to Ansu Banerjee, Assistant Regional Director,
Los Angeles Regional Office, Division of Enforcement, United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, 444 S. Flower Street, Suite 900, Los
Angeles, CA 90071. Respondent may extend the time period for issuance
of the Initial Report with prior written approval of the Commission staff.

Respondent shall undertake one follow-up review, incorporating any
comments provided by the Commission staff on the Initial Report, to further
monitor and assess the operation of its FCPA and anti-corruption
compliance program and whether Respondentâs policies and procedures are
reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws (the âFinal Reportâ).

The reports submitted by Respondent will likely include proprietary,

contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except
(a) pursuant to court order, (b) as agreed by the parties in writing, (c) to the
extent that the Commission staff determines in its sole discretion that

Order, it will make reasonable efforts to contact the former employees of AB InBevâs United
States entities previously identified by the Commission staff, and provide them with a copy of this
Order and a statement that AB InBev does not prohibit former employees from contacting the
Commission regarding possible violations of federal law or regulation.

G. AB InBev has agreed to certify, in writing, compliance with the undertaking set
forth in Paragraph IV.F above. The certification shall identify the undertaking, provide written

SEC Charges Anheuser-Busch InBev With Violating FCPA and
Whistleblower Protection Laws

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2016-196

Washington D.C., Sept. 28, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Anheuser-Busch InBev has agreed to pay
$6 million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and chilled a whistleblower who reported the misconduct.
An SEC investigation found that the company used third-party sales promoters to make improper payments to government officials in India to
increase the sales and production of Anheuser-Busch InBev products in that country. Despite repeated complaints from employees,
Anheuser-Busch InBev had inadequate internal accounting controls to detect and prevent the improper payments, and the company failed to
ensure that transactions involving the promoters were recorded properly in its books and records.

The SECâs order further finds that Anheuser-Busch InBev entered into a separation agreement that stopped an employee from continuing to
voluntarily communicate with the SEC about potential FCPA violations due to a substantial financial penalty that would be imposed for
violating strict non-disclosure terms.

âAnheuser-Busch InBev recorded improper payments by its sales promoters in India as legitimate expenses in its financial accounting, and
then exacerbated the problem by including language in a separation agreement that chilled an employee from communicating with the SEC,â
said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

âThreat of financial punishment for whistleblowing is unacceptable,â added Jane Norberg, Acting Chief of the SECâs Office of the
Whistleblower. âWe will continue to take a hard look at these types of provisions and fact patterns.â

The SECâs order finds that Anheuser-Busch InBev, which is headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, violated the books and records provisions and
the internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws as well as Securities Exchange Act Rule 21F-17(a). Anheuser-Busch

InBev agreed to pay $2,712,955 in disgorgement plus interest of $292,381 and a penalty of $3,002,955. For a two-year period, the company
must cooperate with the SEC and report its FCPA compliance efforts while making reasonable efforts to notify certain former employees that
Anheuser-Busch InBev does not prohibit employees from contacting the SEC about possible law violations.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Morgan B. Ward Doran, Sonali Singh, and Carol Shau, and supervised by Alka Patel. The SEC
appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and

the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
