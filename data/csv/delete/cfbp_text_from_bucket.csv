Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
Accelerate is a Delaware limited liability corporation with its principal place

of business in Newark, Delaware.

Accelerate is licensed to engage in business as a mortgage broker and lender
in about 31 states.

Accelerate is a âperson,â as defined in the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(19),
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(22), and the MAP Rule, 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.2, because it is a limited liability corporation.

During the Relevant Period, Accelerate has been a âcovered personâ under
the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A), because it is a person that engages in

offering and providing residential-mortgage loans, which are âconsumer

financial product[s] or service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (6),
(15)(A)Q).

During the Relevant Period, Accelerate has been subject to the MAP Rule
because it is a person over which the Federal Trade Commission has
jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 41-58.
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.1. The MAP Rule is a Federal consumer financial law. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(14).

Accelerate provides âmortgage credit product[s],â as that term is defined in
the MAP Rule. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

Accelerateâs mortgage advertisements are âcommercial communicationsâ
regarding a term of a âmortgage credit product,â as those terms are defined
in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

During the Relevant Period, Accelerate has offered âclosed-end creditâ in
the form of mortgage loans to âconsumers,â as those terms are defined in
Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10) & (11).

Accelerateâs mortgage advertisements are advertisements for âclosed-end
credit,â as that term is defined in Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).
Accelerate offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by

the VA.

Accelerateâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since April 2018, Accelerate has mailed more than a million mortgage

advertisements to consumers in at least 31 states.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Accelerate was responsible for both the content
of, and dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, payment amount, or closing costs.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Accelerate represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms.

In fact, Accelerate did not offer or arrange mortgages with the specific credit

terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Accelerate misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements misrepresented the interest
rate applicable to the advertised mortgage.

Specifically, Accelerate advertisements sent to 7,105 consumers in April
2018 advertised a VA cash-out refinance loan with a fixed simple interest
rate of 3.75%. But the lowest available rate at the time for a VA cash-out
refinance loan offered by Accelerate was 4.875%.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements misrepresented the payment
amount applicable to the advertised mortgage and the existence, nature, or
amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection with the
advertised mortgage.

For example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 13,544 consumers in March
and April 2019 stated that the borrower could âaccess $20,000 for only
$95.05 per monthâ with a VA loan.

In reality, obtaming any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home
equity would be possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and
refinanced the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out

refinance mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than $95.05.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

Specifically, Accelerate advertisements sent to 7,105 consumers in April
2018 stated that there were âNo Closing Costsâ for the advertised loan.

All VA loans have closing costs, and Accelerate has never closed a VA loan
without closing costs. Thus, consumers would need to pay closing costs for
the loan featured in these advertisements. Accordingly, in connection with
the loan that Accelerate was advertising, the statement âNo Closing Costsâ
was false.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 26-33
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly
or by implication, through the use of formats, symbols, or logos that
resemble those of a governmental entity such as the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), that the

provider of the advertised mortgage was, or was affiliated with, a
37.

38.

2020-BCFP-0014 Document1 Filed 09/02/2020 Page 10 of 48

governmental entity, that the advertisement was sent by or on behalf of the
VA or another governmental entity, or that the advertised product related to
a federal tax benefit, or was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the
IRS or the FDIC.

For example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 381,829 consumers from
April through October 2018 were formatted to look like a notification letter

from the IRS. The top of these advertisements appeared as follows:

A018

sam
hl

 

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

1*41 #1 eer ALL FOR AADC 207

 

The advertisements included the year â2018â printed in block numbers in the
top right corner with the â20â in white and the â18â in black, a distinctive
format used by the IRS. In the top left corner, where the name of the sender
would normally appear, was a QR Code, and underneath that the words in
bold âADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE.â The combined effect made the return
address/sender portion of the advertisements look like an IRS return address

block and gave the impression that the communication was coming from the

IRS.

These advertisements were formatted as letters to the consumer, witha
greeting followed by two sections headed âNOTICEâ and âSTATUS.â The
body of the letter instructed the consumer to âplease call our VA Program
Customer Support Representativeâ and to reference a specified âNOTICE
NUMBERâ on the call. Accelerateâs name did not appear anywhere in the
body of the letter. Instead, Accelerateâs logo was relegated to the bottom of
the page, just above the fine print. Accelerateâs logo incorporated an image
resembling the American flag, which added to the impression that the
communication was from an official government source.

Similarly, Accelerate advertisements sent to 42,311 consumers from July
through October 2018 used the IRSâs distinctive black and white block letter
formatting of the year â2018,â and displayed a QR Code next to the words
âADMINISTRATIVE OFFICEâ where the senderâs name would normally
appear.

These advertisements also instructed the consumer to call âour VA Program
Representative... to receive a detailed explanation of the benefits available
and how to access them.â In addition to these characteristics, this instruction
implied that if consumers called the toll-free number provided, they would

be connected to someone affiliated with the VA who could advise them on

their benefits, rather than an employee of a third-party mortgage broker or
lender interested in convincing them to refinance their current mortgage.

In another example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 30,500 consumers in
October 2018 were formatted to look like an official citation or ticket, as

follows:

The use of the words âEXPIRATION NOTICEâ in bold with reference to
the property address and county in which the property was located,
combined with the barcode along the left-hand side and the details about the
âNotice Typeâ and âNotice Number,â created the impression that the
document was from a government agency.

In another example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 6,501 consumers in
April 2018 displayed an official âMember FDICâ logo, even though
Accelerate is not and has never been a member of the FDIC.

were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About Time Limits on VA Loan Benefits

47.

48.

49.

50.

S1.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements falsely represented that the
consumerâs access to mortgage-refinance benefits through VA-guaranteed
loans was time-limited.

For example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 56,497 consumers in July
2019 stated: âThis VA Cash-Out program is available to Veterans like you!
This offer is available to you through July 15, 2019.â The advertisements
provided general information about VA cash-out refinance loans, such as
stating that the cash-out refinance loan, including the consumerâs existing
mortgage balance, could be for up to 100% of the homeâs value. The
advertisements did not provide any time-sensitive mortgage terms such as
interest rate, APR, or payment amount.

This statement above represented that the veteranâs access to benefits under
the âVA Cash-Out programâ would expire after July 15, 2019.

In fact, that representation was false because a veteranâs eligibility for and
access to the benefits of a VA loan never expire.

Reasonable consumers who received the advertisements described in

paragraphs 47-50 were likely to be misled by them under the circumstances.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Many of Accelerateâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of repayment
or the amount of a payment. Under certain sections of Regulation Z,
including Â§ 1026.24(d) and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific
disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did not include the
other disclosures that are required or did not include them in the manner
required.
Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment or the amount of a payment, but failed to state the terms of
repayment reflecting the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.
For example, the advertisements for cash-out refinance loans described in
Paragraphs 29-30 above stated a payment amount but failed to state the
terms of repayment reflecting the repayment obligations over the full term of
the loan. Specifically, the advertisements disclosed terms of repayment only
for the portion of the loan that would be used to cash out the $20,000

amount against the consumerâs home equity; they did not disclose the terms

of repayment for the full amount of the advertised cash-out refinance loan
over the full term of the loan.

In another example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 20,002 consumers in
November 2018 stated that the advertised mortgage would have a monthly
payment of $1,304.12.

Although these advertisements stated a payment amount, they failed to state
the annual percentage rate (APR) of the advertised mortgage.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply
over the term of the loan; failed to clearly and conspicuously state the period
during which each payment would apply; or failed to state the fact that the
advertised payments did not include amounts for taxes and insurance
premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be
greater, or failed to do so clearly and conspicuously.

For example, the advertisements for cash-out refinance loans described in
Paragraphs 29-30 above disclosed only the monthly payment amount for the
portion of the loan that would be used to take out the advertised cash-out
amount. Although these advertisements stated a payment amount, they failed
to disclose the full amount of each payment that would apply over the term

of the loan. These advertisements also did not contain an equally prominent
60.

61.

62.

and closely proximate statement of the period during which each payment
would apply, as Regulation Z requires in Â§ 1026.24(f)(3). The term of the
loan was stated only in fine print at the bottom. Theadvertisements also
failed to disclose that the payment amount did not include amounts for taxes
and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation would be greater.

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z

Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)
Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]fan advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â
Accelerate violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 22-33,
numerous Accelerate advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.

Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)
Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), ifan advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount

of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon paymentâ and the APR of the loan. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1),
(2)(i1), (iti).

63. Accelerate violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs 54-57,
numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements set forth the period of
repayment or the amount of any payment, which are triggering terms under Â§
1026.24(d)(1)(ii) and (11), but failed to state the repayment obligations over
the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)(i1) or the APR of the

loan, pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)(in).
Inadequate Disclosure of Payment Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i)

64. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be
disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;
and

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien ona
dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts
65.

66.

67.

for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the
actual payment obligation will be greater.

Accelerate violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs
58-59, numerous Accelerate direct-mail mortgage advertisements stated the
amount of a payment but did not include one or more of the disclosures
required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(4)(A) through (C), or did not disclose

them clearly and conspicuously, as defined in Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i).

VIOLATIONS OF THE MAP RULE (REGULATION N)
Misrepresentations About Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â|t]he annual
percentage rate, simple annual rate, periodic rate, or any other rateâ
applicable to a mortgage credit product. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, sucha
misrepresentation is specifically prohibited and is therefore material.
Accelerate violated Â§ 1014.3(b) because, as described in Paragraphs 26-27,
numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations

about the interest rate applicable to a mortgage credit product.

Misrepresentations About Payments, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(k)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(k), it is a violation for any person subject to the

number, amount, or timing of any minimum or required payments, including
but not limited to misrepresentations about any payments or that no
payments are required in a reverse mortgage or other mortgage credit
product.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically

74. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(n), it is a violation for any person subject to the

75. Accelerate violated Â§ 1014.3(n) because, as described in Paragraphs 36-44,
numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
that the provider of the advertised mortgage credit product was, or was

affiliated with, a governmental entity; that the advertised product related to a

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service 1s material to consumers.
Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 22-35, Accelerateâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific interest rates, payment

amounts, or closing costs stated in those advertisements, when in fact those

specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that Accelerate

was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

Accelerateâs misrepresentations about the availability ofthe advertised
credit terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Accelerateâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Accelerate engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
Deceptive Representations About Government Affiliation

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 36â46, Accelerateâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
Accelerate was affiliated with a governmental entity; that the advertised
product related to a federal tax benefit; that the advertised product was
endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with a governmental entity such as the
IRS or the FDIC; or that the advertisement was sent by or on behalf of the
VA or another governmental entity.

In fact, Accelerate was not affiliated with the government and the advertised

product did not relate to a federal tax benefit; the advertised product was not

endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the IRS or the FDIC; and the
advertisement was not sent by or on behalf of the VA or another
governmental entity.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were material
because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers.
Therefore, Accelerate engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Time Limits on VA Loan Benefits
In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 47-52, Accelerateâ s
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that a
veteranâs access to mortgage-refinance benefits through VA-guaranteed
loans was time-limited.
In fact, a veteranâs eligibility for and access to the benefits of a VA loan
never expire.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about time limits on VA loan benefits were
likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about time limits on VA loan benefits were

material because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of

consumers.
Therefore, Accelerate engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Zand the MAP Rule

Under the CFP A, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules

thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).

Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.

Accelerateâs violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in
Paragraphs 60-75, constitute violations of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12

U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Seventh Mortgage Company
to Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and
Veterans

SEP 02, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Accelerate Mortgage, LLC (Accelerate), a Delaware limited liability
corporation that is licensed as a mortgage broker and lender in about 31 states. Accelerate
offers and provides mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). Accelerateâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is
through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers
and veterans. The Bureau found that Accelerate sent consumers mailers for VA-guaranteed
mortgages that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked
required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices -
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires Accelerate to
pay a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the seventh case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of
multiple mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed
mortgages. The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially
unlawful advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of
investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the
financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Accelerate disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, Accelerate advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including misrepresenting the interest rate or payment amount applicable
to the advertised mortgage and the nature or amount of cash available to the consumer in
connection with the advertised mortgage. Accelerate also made misrepresentations about
the existence or amount of fees or costs to the consumer in connection with the advertised
mortgage. Accelerate advertisements created the false impression that Accelerate was
affiliated with the government by using words, phrases, images, or designs that are
associated with the VA, Internal Revenue Service, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Accelerate advertisements also falsely represented that the consumer's access to mortgage-
refinance benefits through VA-guaranteed loans was time-limited. The Bureau also found
that Accelerate advertisements failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z,
credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the annual percentage rate of the
advertised mortgage or the consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the
loan.

The consent order against Accelerate requires Accelerate to pay a civil penalty of $225,000.
The consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including
requiring Accelerate to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising
compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with
mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those
identified by the Bureau; and requiring Accelerate to comply with certain enhanced
disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

telecommunications companies and furnishes information about consumers

to CRAs.

Respondent furnishes consumer-account information to CRAs. The

consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. This
activity is a consumer-financial product or service under the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (15)(A)(ix).

Respondent regularly collects defaulted consumer debt related to a consumer
financial product or service, including telecommunications debt that was
owed to companies that regularly extend credit by providing
telecommunications service to consumers without requiring immediate
payment or by providing equipment installment plans. This activity is a
consumer financial product or service under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§
5481(5), (15)(A)(x).

Respondent is a âcovered personâ under the CFPA because it engages in
offering or providing a consumer-financial product or service, 12 U.S.C. Â§
5481(5), (6), 15(A)(ix).

Respondent regularly furnishes information relating to consumers to CRAs
for inclusion in consumer reports. Therefore, it is a âfurnisherâ under
Regulation V. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.41(c).

Respondent is a âpersonâ under the FCRA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 168 1a(b).

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Â§ 623(a)(1)(A) of the FCRA

Respondent furnishes information about debt-collection accounts to CRAs,
including the nationwide CRAs: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion (the
NCRAs).

Respondent does not, on any correspondence used generally with

consumers, clearly and conspicuously specify an address to which

consumers can send notice that information Respondent furnished to a CRA

is inaccurate.

Respondent uses an automated system, which employs certain furnishing

logic, to report information to the NCRAs.

In some instances, from at least March 2016 through July 2017,

Respondentâs furnishing logic incorrectly translated its account files into the

format used to report consumer information to the NCRAs, which resulted in

Respondent furnishing at least the following inaccurate information:

a. Respondent furnished actual payment amounts as zero dollars on
approximately 165,600 accounts, even though those consumers had made
payments.

b. Respondent also furnished current balances and amounts past due in
amounts other than zero dollars on approximately 72,000 accounts, even

though those consumersâ accounts were settled in full.

Respondent knew or had reasonable cause to believe that this information
was inaccurate because its own records reflected the correct account
information.

Under section 623(a)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(1), unless a
person clearly and conspicuously specifies to a consumer an address to
which the consumer can send notice that information the person furnished to
a CRA is inaccurate, a person shall not furnish any information relating to a
consumer to any CRA if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe
that the information is inaccurate.

Respondent furnished consumer information to CRAs that it knew or had
reasonable cause to believe was inaccurate, because the information it
furnished was different than the information in Respondentâs files.
Respondent did not clearly and conspicuously specify to consumers an
address for receipt of notices that furnished information was inaccurate,
pursuant to section 623(a)(1)(C) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(1)(C).
Thus, Respondent violated section 623(a)(1)(A) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

1681s-2(a)(1)(A).

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Â§ 623(a)(5) of the FCRA

19.

On many accounts that it furnished, from at least March 2016 through July

2018, Respondent failed to report an appropriate date of first delinquency,

1.e., the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the
account that immediately preceded the delinquent account being placed for
collection.

Respondentâs creditor clients did not furnish accounts to CRAs before
sending accounts into collection and therefore did not previously furnish
dates of first delinquency for those accounts.

When creditors would send accounts to Respondent for collection, the
accounts often did not specify a date of first delinquency. Instead of
establishing and following reasonable procedures to obtain dates of first
delinquency from its creditor clients, Respondent would instead select from
dates that the creditors did provide, including the date on which
telecommunications service was disconnected, or when the debt was charged
off, and Respondent would furnish such dates as the date of first
delinquency.

The disconnect date is not an accurate date of first delinquency because
telecommunications services are often not disconnected until after a
consumer has been delinquent for some time. Likewise, the date on which a
debt is charged off is not an accurate date of first delinquency because debts
are often not charged off until a consumer has been delinquent for some

time.
23.

24.

25.

Section 623(a)(5) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5), requires that a
person who furnishes information to a CRA regarding a âdelinquent account
being placed for collectionâ must notify the CRA of the date the delinquency
commenced, subject to the rules set forth in 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5)(B).
For many accounts on which it furnished, Respondent failed to notify the
CRA to which it furnished information of a date of first delinquency that
complied with 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5).

Therefore, Respondent violated Â§ 623(a)(5) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

1681s-2(a)(5).

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Â§ 623(b)(1) of the FCRA

26.

27.

28.

Consumers can dispute information furnished to a CRA either with a CRA
(indirect dispute) or directly with a furnisher (direct dispute).

Respondent receives indirect disputes through the Online Solution for
Complete and Accurate Reporting (E-OSCAR). E-OSCAR is a web-based
system developed by the NCRAs to help process indirect disputes.

When a consumer submits an indirect dispute about a debt furnished by
Respondent to one of the NCRAs, it is routed to Respondent through E-
OSCAR. Any supporting documentation submitted by the consumer to the

NCRA with the dispute is also sent to Respondent through E-OSCAR. In

addition, the NCRAs assign a code to each dispute, reflecting the subject
matter of the dispute.

Upon receipt, Respondent generally has 30 days to conduct a reasonable
investigation of a dispute, as required by Â§ 623(b)(1) of the FCRA, and to
submit a response through E-OSCAR that the disputed information should
be deleted, modified, or verified as being accurate as reported.

A reasonable investigation must be responsive to the specific allegations in
the consumerâs dispute; the more specific a dispute is, the more thorough the
investigation should be.

In some instances, from at least March 2016 through June 2017, when
Respondent received disputes with specific allegations that could not be
reasonably investigated with the limited information in Respondentâs files,
Respondentâs employees did not reach out to the original creditor for the
information required to reasonably investigate the dispute. Respondentâs
employees used only the inadequate information in Respondentâs files to do
their investigations of such disputes.

Respondent also uses an automated program to handle certain indirect
disputes without human involvement. In investigating indirect disputes, the

automated program only considered information in Respondentâs own

account database, did not access any of its creditor-clientsâ files, and did not
refer disputes to clients for further investigation.

In some instances, the automated software handled indirect disputes in an
unreasonable manner because certain specific consumer disputes handled by
the automated software that should have been referred to the client for
investigation to obtain further information were not.

Under Â§ 623(b)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(b)(1), when a
furnisher of information to a CRA receives a notice of dispute regarding the
completeness or accuracy of the reported information from a CRA in
accordance with the provisions of Â§ 611(a)(2) of the FCRA, the furnisher is
required to conduct a reasonable investigation and review all relevant
information provided by the CRA.

In some instances, Respondent has not conducted a reasonable investigation
when it has received a notice of dispute from a CRA under the provisions of
Â§ 611(a)(2) of the FCRA.

Therefore, Respondent has violated Â§ 623(b)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

1681s-2(b)(1).

38.

39.

From at least January 2016 through June 2017, Respondent failed to conduct
reasonable investigations of direct disputes.

Respondent systematically treated direct disputes under FCRA and disputes
under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCP A) as indistinguishable.
Under the FDCPA, if a consumer sends a written dispute within a specified
time period, the debt collector is required to send âvalidation,â which is
typically a bill copy or other proof of the debt. Respondent conflated FCRA
and FDCPA dispute requirements and treated many direct disputes as if they
were merely seeking FDCPA validation. As a result, when Respondent
lacked the information to reasonably investigate a direct dispute under
FCRA, Respondent would often not forward the dispute on to the client for
investigation but would instead respond with bill copies or by simply
checking Respondentâs own records, an approach that often failed to answer
the issue raised by the consumer.

In addition, for the period between January and June 2017, Respondent was
not able to access one of its creditor-clientâs system files, and did not

forward disputes on to that creditor-client for further investigation.

From at least April 2016 through June 2017, with respect to direct disputes
relating to paid accounts, Respondent ignored all such disputes after the first
two submitted by a consumer.

From March 2016 through May 2018, in certain instances, Respondent
would cause the tradelines to be deleted from consumersâ credit reports
instead of investigating the disputes.

Section 623(a)(8)(E)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(8)(E)G), and Â§
1022.43(e)(1) of Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43(e)(1), require
Respondent, upon receipt of a direct dispute from a consumer, to conduct a
reasonable investigation with respect to the disputed information.

In some instances, Respondent has not conducted a reasonable investigation
when it has received a direct dispute from a consumer.

Therefore, Respondent has violated Â§ 623(a)(8)(E)(1) of the FCRA, 15
U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(8)(E)() and Â§ 1022.43(e)(1) of Regulation V, 12 C.F.R.

49.

In addition to a failure to reasonably investigate direct disputes, from at least
January 2016 through August 2018, Respondent failed to timely respond to
direct disputes.

In some instances, Respondent failed to respond to direct disputes within 30
days, if at all.

This was caused by:

a. Respondentâs treating direct disputes under FCRA the same as disputes

under the FDCPA, which do not have a time limit for resolution;
b. significant backlogs in its dispute queues;

c. accounts being recalled by clients in response to disputes, after which
Respondent would not respond to those consumersâ disputes.

Where Respondent determined that a direct dispute was âfrivolousâ or

âirrelevantâ and therefore would not be investigated, from at least April

2016 through June 2017, Respondent failed to send required notices to the

consumer within five days of such determination.

Section 623(a)(8)(E)(i1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(8)(E)(in),

and Â§ 1022.43(e)(3)of Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43(e)(3), require

furnishers to respond to direct disputes, generally, within 30 days of
receiving notice of the dispute.

50. In some instances, Respondent has not responded to consumersâ direct
disputes within the required time period.

51. Therefore, Respondent violated Â§ 623(a)(8)(E)(in) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

168 1s-2(a)(8)(E)(Gil), and Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43(e)(3).
Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Â§ 1022.42 of Regulation V

52. Respondent did not establish or implement reasonable policies and
procedures regarding its furnishing of consumer information to CRAs, as
appropriate to the size, nature, and complexity of its furnishing activities.

53. Examples of the failures of its policies and procedures include:

a. Respondentâs indirect dispute policy did not instruct employees to access
clientsâ systems or make requests to clients to obtain information or
source documentation, as needed, before attempting to resolve an indirect

dispute.

b. Respondent had no written policies accurately explaining how its

automated E-OSCAR program responds to indirect disputes.

c. Respondent did not distinguish between direct disputes under FCRA and
disputes under FDCPA, treating both as the same, and failing to adhere to

the timing and notification requirements for FCRA disputes.

d. No policy explained how to conduct a reasonable investigation of a

FCRA dispute.

e. Respondentâs written direct dispute policy did not include procedures on

how to determine whether a dispute was frivolous or irrelevant and did

not require employees to send notices of such determination.

Respondentâs policies and procedures were also not reviewed or updated as
necessary for continued effectiveness. For example, prior to 2017,
Respondent had not modified its automated furnishing code for at least four
years. And despite Respondentâs knowledge that employees were not
complying with its dispute policies and with FCRA dispute requirements
more generally, Respondent failed to review or update its dispute policies

and procedures.

Part E of Regulation V, requires in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42 that a furnisher of

consumer information:

a. establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures

regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to

be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the

furnisherâs activities;

b. consider and incorporate the appropriate guidelines set forth in Appendix

E of 12 C.F.R. Part 1022 in developing such policies and procedures; and

c. review such policies and procedures periodically and update them as

necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness.

Respondent did not establish or implement reasonable policies and

procedures regarding its furnishing of consumer information to CRAs or

handling of consumer disputes.

Respondent did not consider or incorporate, as appropriate, the guidelines
set forth in Appendix E of Regulation V in developing its policies and
procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information it

furnishes to consumer reporting agencies.

Respondent also failed to review or update its policies and procedures as

necessary for continued effectiveness.

Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42.

include an assessment of whether Respondentâs current policies, practices,
and procedures regarding furnishing of consumer information to CRAs
comply with the FCRA and Regulation V. The purposes of the review must

be, at the very least, to determine:

a. whether Respondent has developed, maintained, and implemented
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with Section VI of this

Order;

b. whether Respondent has developed, maintained, and implemented
policies and procedures to ensure Board-level oversight of and

commitment to compliance with the FCRA;

c. whether Respondent has developed, maintained, and implemented
policies and procedures, including employee training and other
applicable employee guidance, to address the acts and practices that are

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how

the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:

a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification
from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any
insurance policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this

Consent Order.

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. Ifthe court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of

a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the

amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and

payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be

returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount

arising out of this Consent Order.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Settlement with Debt
Collector for Credit Reporting Violation

NOV 12, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today
announced a settlement with Afni, Inc. (Afni) to address its violations in providing
information to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). Afni is a non-bank Illinois-based debt
collector that specializes in collecting debt on behalf of telecommunications companies and
furnishes information to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) about consumersâ credit. The
consent order requires Afni to take certain steps to prevent future violations and imposes a
$500,000 civil money penalty.

The Bureau found that Afni furnished information to CRAs that it knew or had reasonable
cause to believe was inaccurate and failed to report to CRAs an appropriate date of first
delinquency on certain accounts. The Bureau also found that Afni failed to conduct
reasonable investigations of disputes made by consumers both to Afni and to CRAs about
furnished information and failed to conduct investigations of disputes made to Afni in a
timely manner. In addition, the Bureau found that Anfi failed to send required notices to
consumers about the results of such investigations and failed to establish, implement, and
update its policies and procedures regarding its furnishing of consumer information to
CRAs. Afniâs conduct violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing
rule, Regulation V and, by engaging in these violations of the FCRA and Regulation V, Afni
violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

Under the terms of the consent order, Afni must take certain steps to improve and ensure
the accuracy of its furnishing of consumer information to CRAs and its policies and
procedures relating to credit reporting and dispute investigation. These required steps
include conducting monthly reviews of account information to assess the accuracy and
integrity of information it furnishes. Afni must also conduct monthly reviews of consumer
disputes and responses to assess whether its handling of consumer disputes complies with
the FCRA, Regulation V, and its own policies and procedures. The consent order also
requires Afni to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of Afniâs activities,
policies, and procedures relating to furnishing information and credit reporting to ensure
that its current policies, practices, and procedures regarding furnishing of consumer
information to CRAs comply with the FCRA and Regulation V.

The consent order is available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_afni-

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Arkansas Attorney General Settle with
Home-Alarm Company for Using Consumersâ Credit Scores Without Proper
Notice

DEC 11, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and the
Arkansas Attorney General settled with Alder Holdings, LLC (Alder), resolving their
allegations that Alder failed to provide proper notices under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
(FCRA). Alder is a Utah-based company that sells home-security and alarm systems,
primarily door-to-door, throughout the country and has sold its products and services to
over 115,000 customers. The Bureau and Arkansas filed a proposed stipulated final
judgment and order in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. If
entered by the court, the settlement would require Alder to pay a $600,000 civil money
penalty, $100,000 of which will be offset if Alder pays that amount to settle related litigation
with the State of Arkansas that is currently pending in state court in Arkansas. The settlement
would also require Alder to provide proper notices under FCRA.

The FCRA and its implementing regulation, Regulation V, require companies to give
consumers notice when the companies provide consumers with less favorable credit terms
based on a review of their credit reportsâalso known as risk-based pricing. The complaint
alleged that Alder, in extending credit to its customers for its home-alarm products and
services, charged customers who had lower credit scores higher activation fees, but failed
to provide those customers with the required risk-based pricing notice. Arkansas also
alleged that Alder violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.

The complaint is available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_alder-
holdings-llc_complaint_2020-12.pdf (cfpb.gov/documents/9410/cfpb_alder-holdings-llc_

Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 1 of 15
3. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Bounce Back because the causes
of action arise from BounceBackâs conduct in this district.

A. Venue is proper in this district because BounceBack is located, resides,
and does business in this district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).

PARTIES

5. The Bureau is an agency of the United States charged with regulating the
offering and provision of consumer-financial products and services under âFederal
consumer financial laws,â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5491(a), including the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(14).
The Bureau has independent litigating authority, including the authority to enforce the
CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 8 5564(a), (b).

6. Because BounceBack is a corporation, it is a âpersonâ under the CFPA. 12

personâ under the CFPA because it âengages in offering or providing a consumer
financial product or service.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A).

FACTS
Overview

8. BounceBack, Inc., is a privatelyowned company based in Kansas City, Missouri. It
operates back-check pretrial-diversion programs on behalf of more than 90 district
attorneys (DAs) throughout the United States. BounceBackâs pretrial-diversion program
generally operates as follows.

9. Merchants primarily submit dishonored checks to Bounce Back through its

affiliate, Check Connection, Inc.

2
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 2 of 15
10. | Aftera merchant reports a dishonored check to Check Connection, Check
Connection adds it to a list of dishonored checks by jurisdiction and sends it to the
pertinent DA for review.

11. In nearly all cases, without receiving further direction from the DA,
BounceBack then attempts to enroll the check writers in its pre-trial diversion program,
which requires a check writer to pay the debt and also enroll in, pay for, and complete a
financial-education course.

12. | Onrare occasions, merchants send the names of check writers directly to
the local DA, who then forwards to BounceBack the names of specific check writers who
it wants enrolled in the pretrial-diversion program. In most cases, however, Check
Connection generates a list of check writers that it sends to BounceBack, which enrolls
those check writers in its collections program without ever receiving direction from the
DA to do so.

13. BounceBack then sends two to four letters, on DA letterhead, to the check
writers in an effort to collect the outstanding debts and enroll them in the financial-
education course.

14. The letters tell check writers that they could face criminal prosecution and
conviction, but that they can avoid prosecution by paying the amount of the dishonored
check, along with certain administrative fees, and completing a financial-education
course. The recipient is instructed to pay the total fees owed to the âCheck Enforcement
Programâ (in reality BounceBack), including a fee for the financial-education course that
ranges from $100 to $165. If the check writer pays these amounts, then BounceBack
sends the amount of the dishonored check to the merchant, pays small fees to the
merchant and the DA, and keeps the balance.

3
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 3 of 15
15. | BounceBack does not identify itself to check writers and does not inform
them that it is a debt collector.

16. Although BounceBackâs letters appear to come directly from the DA and
suggest that check writers will face criminal charges if they do not comply, DAs almost
never prosecute such cases.

17. | Moreover, nearly all jurisdictions have given BounceBack one set of
criteria for sending warning letters to check writers and enrolling them in a financial-
education course, and a separate, more stringent set of criteria for referring a case back
to the DA for potential prosecution when a check writer fails to respond to a letter.
Given these distinct criteria, not all check writers who receive BounceBackâs warning
letters are even eligible for prosecution under the DAsâ prosecution criteria.

18. |Inmost cases, BounceBack does not refer cases for prosecution, evenif the
check writer fails to respond to the letter, does not pay the alleged outstanding debt and
fees, or fails to complete the financial-education course.

19. | BounceBack has sent collection letters to more than 19,000 consumers
since January 1, 2015.

BounceBack is a Debt Collector Under the FDCPA

20. BounceBack is a debt collector under the FDCPA.

21. Under 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692a(6), a debt collector is âany person who uses any
instrument or instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the
principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or
attempts to collect directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or

due another.â

4
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 4 of 15
22. The FDCPA provides that an entity operating a bad-check diversion
program through a contract with a DA may not be considered a debt collector if the
entity complies with certain statutory requirements. BounceBack did not comply with
those requirements.

23. Inmostcases, BounceBack contacts check writers and attempts to collect
on dishonored checks and enroll the check writers in its pre-trial diversion program
without the DA having made a determination that âprobable cause of a bad check
violation under State penal law exists, and that contact with the alleged offender for
purposes of participation in the program is appropriate,â as required by 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1692p(a)(2)(C)(iv)(D.

24. Inaddition, BounceBackâs letters do not contain a clear and conspicuous
statement that if the alleged offender notifies the private entity or the DA in writing, not
later than 30 days after being contacted for the first time pursuant to 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1692p(a)(2)(C) (iv), that there is a dispute pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692p(a), then
further restitution efforts will not be pursued until the DA or an employee of the DA
authorized to make such a determination makes a determination that there is probable
cause to believe that a crime has been committed, as required by 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1692p(a)(2)(C)(v) (1).

False, Deceptive, or Misleading
Representations in Connection with Collecting a Debt

a. BounceBack falsely represents that nonpayment will
result in criminal prosecution.

25. Ifa DAexpresses interest in using BounceBackâs services, BounceBack
sends it an initial packet explaining its pretrial-diversion program. The packet contains
templates of the collection letters BounceBack will send to check writers, which the DA

5
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 5 of 15
can change according to its preferences. Most DAs make few, if any, changes to the

template.

26. BounceBackâs collection letters state in several ways that a check writer

who does not pay the outstanding check amount and fees for the pretrial-diversion

program may face âcriminal chargesâ or âcriminal prosecutionâ:

da.

b.

âWARNING OF CRIMINAL CHARGESâ;

âthe total amount must be received ... to avoid possible criminal
charges being filedâ;

âpay the total listed below to avoid the possibility of criminal
prosecutionâ;

âIt is still possible to avoid a CRIMINAL CONVICTIONâ;

âWARNING... You have 48 hours to contact the Check
Enforcement Program, before your case is forwarded to final review
... Ifthe check(s) is not taken care of, a criminal complaint and a
WARRANT may be issued commanding you to appear in court and
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS may resultâ;

âFailure to make payment in full within THIRTY (30) DAYS from
the date of this notice may be used as evidence in a possible
criminal prosecutionâ;

âIf payment can be arranged and compliance with the conditions of
the Check Enforcement Program are met, you may yet be able to
prevent the possibility of a WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST being
issuedâ;

âTO COMPLY: 1) Pay the full dollar amount shown within thirty
days. 2) Complete the Check Writerâs Financial Training Courseâ;

âALL check writers whose checks have been referred to the Check
Enforcement Program MUST complete the Educational
Requirement to discharge the case as part of this diversion
programâ;

âFAILURE TO COMPLETE THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT
CAN CAUSE YOUR CASE DIVERSION TO BE REVOKED.â

27. These threats are in almost all instances false.

6

Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 6 of 15
28. Each DA gives BounceBack criteria for sending out its collection letters,
and different, often more stringent, criteria for determining which cases will be referred
back to the DA for a review for prosecution.

29. BounceBack sends collection letters to check writers who do not meet the
DAsâ criteria for referral for prosecution.

30. For example, at least 29 of the more than 90 jurisdictions that Bounce Back
has contracted with will not prosecute check writers if the dishonored check is belowa
certain amount, but BounceBack nevertheless threatens those check writers with
prosecution.

31. Moreover, even if a check writer qualifies for prosecution, BounceBack
rarely refers cases for potential prosecution.

32. Most DAs refuse to prosecute dishonored-check cases even if check writers
fail to respond to Bounce Backâs letters.

33. Finally, almost none of the check writers who enroll in the financial-
education course return the confirmation that they have completed the course, and
many never complete the course. Contrary to the threats in Bounce Backâs letters,
BounceBack never refers those check writers to the DA for possible prosecution.

b. BounceBack creates the false impression that the
collection letters it sends are coming directly froma DA.

34. BounceBackâs letters are sent on DA letterhead and appear to be
statements from the DA.

35. For instance, a typical letter bears the DAâs name and seal at the top. The
letter also tells the check payer to send payment to the â[DAâs] Check Enforcement

Program,â followed by an address that is actually BounceBackâs address.

7
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 7 of 15
36. The letter nowhere states that it was sent by BounceBack, even though the
letter comes directly from BounceBack, not a DA.

c. BounceBackâs collection letters do not reveal that
BounceBack is a debt collector.

37. BounceBack sends letters that fail to state anywhere that BounceBack is a
debt collector or that any information it obtains will be used for collections purposes,
nor does BounceBack disclose in subsequent letters or phone calls with check writers
that it is a debt collector.

38. Moreover, because its letters are sent on DA letterhead using the DAâs seal
and refer to the DAâs âCheck Enforcement Program,â it is unlikely that a recipient would
suspect that the letter is being sent by a debt collector.

d. BounceBack fails to include certain required dispute
notices in its collection letters.

39. |BounceBackâs collection letters fail to contain several required disclosures.

Ao. Severalof BounceBackâs letters state, âYOU MUST EITHER COMPLY BY
MAKING PAYMENT OR NOTIFY THE CHECK ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN
WRITING THAT YOU WISH TO DISPUTE THIS MATTER NO LATER THAN 320 DAYS
AFTER RECEIVING THIS NOTICE,â and âPAYMENT OR DIS[P] UTE MUST BE MADE
WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS LETTER.â

41. Butthese same letters do not disclose that unless a recipient disputes the
validity of the debt within 30 days, the debt will be assumed valid; that if a recipient
disputes the validity of the debt within 30 days, the collector must verify the debt; or
that if a recipient makes a request within 30 days, the collector will provide the original

creditorâs name and address.

COUNT 1â Violations of the FDCPA
Falsely Representing that Nonpayment Would
Result in Criminal Prosecution

42. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-41.

43. Section 1692e(4) of the FDCPA prohibits â[t]he representation or
implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any

45. Inconnection with collecting or attempting to collect debt from

by implication, that nonpayment of a debt would result in arrest or imprisonment.

46. Infact, neither BounceBack nor the DAs intended to take such action.

47. These acts and practices violated Â§ 807(4) and (5) of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C.
Â§ 1692e(4) & (5).

51. Inconnection with collecting or attempting to collect debt from
consumers, BounceBack represented to consumers, directly or indirectly, expressly or

names of the DAs in connection with collecting or attempting to collect debts from
consumers.

56. BounceBack falsely represented that the failure to (a) pay the fees listed,
including the dishonored-check amount, administrative fees, and fees for the financial-
education course, and (b) complete the financial-education course, would lead to
criminal prosecution, when in fact it would not for the vast majority of debtors.

10
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Documenti1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 10 of 15

Â§ 1692e(10).

purpose, and the failure to disclose in subsequent communications that the
communication is from a debt collector.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692e(11).

61. BounceBackâs initial communications to consumers did not include that

69. BounceBackâs collection letters contained threats that not paying the
alleged debt and required pretrial-diversion program fees would result in prosecution
when, in fact, it would not.

70. These representations were false because, in most cases, the DAs did not
intend to prosecute individuals who received collection letters threatening further action
or prosecution. And almost none of the check writers who failed to respond to
Bounce Backâs collection letters were ever referred to a DA for âreview for prosecution.â

71. | BounceBackâs misrepresentations were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

72. | BounceBackâs misrepresentations were material because they were likely
to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers regarding whether to pay the alleged
debt and any other program fees.

73. Therefore, BounceBack engaged in deceptive acts or practices that violated

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Debt Collector BounceBack, Inc.

DEC 09, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â- Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
lawsuit against BounceBack, Inc. for allegedly engaging in deceptive and otherwise
unlawful debt collection acts or practices. BounceBack, based in Kansas City, Missouri,
operates bad-check pretrial-diversion programs on behalf of more than 90 district
attorneysâ offices throughout the United States. The Bureau alleges that in the course of
implementing this program, BounceBack violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureauâs
complaint seeks injunctions against BounceBack, as well as damages, redress to consumers,
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of a civil money penalty.

The Bureau filed its complaint in federal court in the Western District of Missouri. The
complaint alleges that since at least 2015, in the course of administering these bad-check
pretrial-diversion programs, BounceBack used district-attorney letterheads to threaten
more than 19,000 consumers with prosecution if they did not pay the amount of the check,
enroll and pay for a financial-education course, and pay various other fees. BounceBack did
not reveal to consumers that BounceBackâand not district attorneysâsent the letters. Nor
did BounceBack reveal that district attorneys almost never prosecuted these cases, even
when consumers ignored BounceBackâs threats. In fact, in most cases, BounceBack did not
refer cases for prosecution, even if the check writer failed to respond to its collection letter.
BounceBackâs letters also failed to include disclosures required under the FDCPA. The
Bureau alleges that BounceBackâs conduct violated the FDCPA, was deceptive under both
the FDCPA and the CFPA, and that its violations of the FDCPA constituted violations of the
CFPA.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has violated the law.

A copy of the complaint is available at:

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
GREENVILLE DIVISION

Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Civil Action No. 6:20-cv-00786-DCC
South Carolina Department of Consumer
Affairs, and the State of Arkansas ex rel.
Leslie Rutledge, Attorney General,
STIPULATED FINAL JUDGMENT
Plaintiffs, AND ORDER

V.

Candy Kern, Howard Sutter HI, and
Upstate Law Group LLC,

Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiffs, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau), the South Carolina
Department of Consumer Affairs (Department), and the State of Arkansas ex rel. Leslie
Rutledge, Attorney General (Arkansas) (Plaintiffs) commenced this civil action on February 20,
2020, to obtain injunctive and monetary relief and civil penalties from Candy Kern, Howard
Sutter II, and Upstate Law Group LLC (Defendants). The Complaint alleges violations of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a), 5564, 5565, in
connection with Defendantsâ provision of substantial assistance to the brokering of contracts
offering high-interest credit to consumers, including (1) misrepresenting to consumers that the
contracts are valid and enforceable when, in fact, the contracts are void from inception because
federal law prohibits agreements under which another person acquires the right to receive a
veteranâs pension payments, 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5301(a)(3)(C), and because South Carolina law, which
governs the contracts, prohibits sales of unpaid earnings and prohibits assignments of pensions as

security on payment of a debt, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-3-403; (2) misrepresenting to consumers that
6:20-cv-00786-DCC Date Filed 01/21/21 Entry Number 52 Page 2 of 15

the offered product is a sale of payments and not a high-interest credit offer; (3) failing to inform
consumers of the applicable interest rate on the credit offer, (4) representing to consumers that
consumers may be subject to criminal prosecution if they breached their contracts, and (5)
representing, expressly or impliedly, that consumers are legally obligated to make payments in
accordance with the terms of their contracts when, in fact, the contracts were void from inception
and consumers are not obligated to make payments. The Complaint also alleges violations of the
South Carolina Consumer Protection Code, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-5-108 (SCCPC), for
unconscionable debt collection.

Plaintiffs and Defendants consent to entry of this Stipulated Final Judgment and Order
(Order), without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, to settle and resolve all matters in
dispute between these parties arising from the conduct alleged in the Complaint.

FINDINGS

1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because it is brought

because they are so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or

reside, or do business in this district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, South Carolina, and Arkansas File Suit
Against Brokers of High-Interest Credit Offers

FEB 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), the South
Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs (South Carolina), and Arkansas Attorney General
Leslie Rutledge today filed a lawsuit in federal district court in the District of South Carolina
against Candy Kern-Fuller, Howard Sutter Ill, and Upstate Law Group LLC. The Bureau
alleges that the defendants worked with a series of companies that brokered contracts
offering high-interest credit to consumers, primarily disabled veterans, and violated the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's prohibition against deceptive acts or practices and
against providing substantial assistance to deceptive and unfair acts or practices of others.

Todayâs action builds on a number of recent Bureau actions against other entities that used
similar contracts and similar marketing tactics in offering high-interest credit to veterans. In
January 2019, the Bureau settled with Mark Corbett. In August 2019, in partnership with
Arkansas, the Bureau settled with Andrew Gamber; Voyager Financial Group, LLC; BAIC,
Inc.; and SoBell Corp. In October 2019, in partnership with South Carolina, the Bureau filed
a lawsuit against Katharine Snyder and her companies, Performance Arbitrage Company,
Inc. and Life Funding Options, Inc. Corbett worked with both Gamber and Snyder, and their
respective companies, to broker contracts offering high-interest credit. In each of these
actions, the Bureau alleged that these contracts violate laws that prohibit these transactions
and render them void, contrary to the representations made by Corbett, Gamber, Snyder,
and their companies that the transactions were valid and enforceable. In these actions, the
Bureau also alleged that the companies misrepresented to consumers that the product is a
sale of payments and not a high-interest credit offer and failed to inform consumers of the
productsâ interest rates. To date, the Bureau Civil Penalty Fund has allocated about $9
million to consumers harmed by Corbett's actions and about $2.7 million to those harmed
by Gamberâs actions.

In todayâs action, the Bureau, South Carolina, and Arkansas allege that the defendants
assisted Gamber, Snyder, and their companies. The Bureau specifically alleges that the
defendants provided substantial assistance to the companiesâ deceptive and unfair acts or
practices by: developing a pre-approval or risk-assessment process for the contracts and
conducting underwriting; approving or denying consumersâ applications to enter into the
transactions; directing and administering the execution of the contracts; serving as the
payment processor for the initial lump-sum payment and fees; and continuing to serve as
the transactionsâ payment processor. In addition, the Bureau alleges that the defendants
provided substantial assistance to deceptive misrepresentations by Gamberâs and Snyder's
companies to consumers that consumers may be subject to criminal prosecution if they
breached their contacts when, in fact, the consumers could not be criminally prosecuted for
breaching their contracts. The Bureau also alleges that the defendants committed deceptive
acts or practices by collecting on the contracts brokered by the companies, including by
filing suit when consumers failed to make payments, and representing, expressly or
impliedly, that consumers are legally obligated to make payments in accordance with the
terms of their contracts when, in fact, the contracts are void from inception and consumers
are not obligated to make payments. The complaint seeks an injunction, redress to
consumers, and the imposition of civil money penalties.

The Bureauâs investigation was conducted in partnership with South Carolina and Arkansas.
The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of South
Carolina is available here: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_kern-
fuller_complaint_2020-02.pdf WY (cfpb.gov/documents/8532/cfpb_kern-fuller_complaint_20

FACTS
Billmg Error Notices and Unauthorized Use Claims

10. The Fair Credit Billing Act, enacted and incorporated into TILA in 1974,
includes substantive protections for credit card users who have billing errors.

11. Inorder to qualify as a billing error notice, a consumerâs communication
to a creditor must: (1) be in writing; (2) be received by the creditor at the address
specified on the periodic statement disclosures; (3) be received no later than 60 days
after the creditor sent the first periodic statement reflecting the alleged billing error;
(4) relate to specified categories of billing errors; (5) enable the creditor to identify the
consumerâs name and account; and (6) to the extent possible, provide details about the
alleged error and the reasons why the consumer believes it was an error. See 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1026.13(a)-(b). If a consumer files a billing error notice, a creditor is required to
investigate the alleged error, send certain notifications to the consumer, and refund any
amount found in error as wellas any related charges that accrued. See 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1026.13(c), (e), and (f).

12. | TILAalso contains protections for consumers who experience
unauthorized use of their credit cards. TILAâs implementing Regulation Z defines
unauthorized use as âthe use of a credit card by a person, other than the cardholder, who
does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and from which the
cardholder receives no benefit.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.12(b)(1)(i).

13. |Whenacard issuer receives a claim of unauthorized use, it is required to
investigate the claim and refund the amount in question and any related charges if
unauthorized use occurred. However, card issuers do not have to provide written

acknowledgment or notifications in response to an unauthorized use claim and the

3

La VAS ae GUC PUL MSO

consumer refund provision allows consumers to be held liable for up to $50. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1026.12(b).

14. Aclaim of unauthorized use may also constitute a billing error notice if it
meets Regulation Zâs billing error notice requirements.

Citizens Automatically Denied Claims Without an Affidavit

15. Since at least 2010 through June 2015, in numerous instances, Citizens
denied consumersâ unauthorized use claims and billing error notices because the
consumers failed to return an affidavit required by the Bank (the Fraud Affidavit).

16.  Citizensâs process permitted Bank employees to require consumers to
complete the Fraud Affidavit provided by the Bank, and automatically deny the claim if
the consumer failed to do so.

17. The Fraud Affidavit states, inter alia, that the consumer âagree[s] to
appear as a witness in Court, and to testify to the fact stated in this Affidavit ....â The
Fraud Affidavit requires notarization, and includes a notarization statement saying,
âSubscribed and sworn... .â

18. Due to the language used in the Fraud Affidavit described in Paragraph 17
and its notarization requirement, consumersâ signatures on the Fraud Affidavit were
subject to the penalty of perjury.

19. |Innumerous instances, Citizens automatically denied consumersâ billing
error notices and unauthorized use claims because those consumers refused to or were

unable to complete the Fraud Affidavit described in Paragraph 17.

Citizens Failed to Refund Finance Charges and Fees on Billing Error Notices
and Unauthorized Use Claims

20. Since at least 2010 through December 2015, Citizens failed to consistently
refund all charges, including finance charges and fees, when it resolved billing error
notices or claims of unauthorized use in consumersâ favor.

21. Inmany cases Citizens failed to refund the full amount due by either
mistakenly calculating the amount of finance charges and fees based on the date the
dispute was placed in its system of record, as opposed to when the dispute arose, or
manually miscalculating finance charges and fees related to transactions that should
have been refunded to consumers.

Citizens Failed to Notify Consumers About Claim Status

22. Since at least 2010 through February 2016, when Citizensâs Credit Card
Payment Operations Department received billing error notices, it did not consistently
send each consumer a written acknowledgement of the claim within 30 days of the
Bankâs receipt of the claim. Likewise, when the Bank conducted an investigation and
found that no billing error had occurred, Citizens did not consistently send each
consumer a written notice of denial within two complete billing cycles (or, in any event,
no later than 90 days) after receiving the claim.

Citizens Failed to Provide Credit Counseling Referrals

23. Since at least February 2010 through November 2015, the Bank advised
consumers to call a specific toll-free number at the Bank to obtain referrals to credit
counseling organizations, but the Bank hadno policies or procedures in place to ensure
that its employees provided credit counseling information when consumers called the

designated phone line.
Case 1:20-cv-00044 Document1 Filed 01/30/20 Page 6 of 12 PagelD #: 6

24. Whenconsumers called the toll-free number, they were routed based on
the status of their accounts: consumers whose accounts were in good standing were
routed to a general customer service department, and consumers whose accounts were
delinquent were routed to the collections department.

VIOLATIONS OF THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT

25.  TILA,15 U.S.C. Â§ 1601 et seg., andits implementing Regulation Z, 12
C.F.R. pt. 1026, establish the basic rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers
who use credit cards and of financial institutions or other persons that offer or service
credit cards.

26. Subject to subtitle B of the CFPA, the Bureau is authorized to enforce TILA
under subtitle E of the CFPA with respect to any person subject to TILA. 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1607(a), (a)(6).

27.  TILAdefines a âcreditorâ as âa person who both (1) regularly extends,
whether in connection with loans, sales of property or services, or otherwise, consumer
credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments or for which the
payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and (2) is the person to whom the
debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the face of the
evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such evidence of indebtedness, by agreement.â
15 U.S.C. Â§ 1602(g).

28. Citizens is a âcreditorâ as defined under TILA.

29. Under TILA, âcreditorsâ are liable for their failure to comply with their
obligations surrounding billing error notices and unauthorized use claims, and they are
liable for failing to provide credit counseling referrals when consumers call a designated

toll-free number. 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1637, 1643, 1666.

30. The Bureau therefore may enforce TILA and Regulation Z with respect to
Citizens.

including signing the affidavits under penalty of perjury and with a provision agreeing to
testify as witnesses.

of unauthorized use for failure of the consumers to provide Fraud Affidavits, including
agreeing to testify as witnesses, violated Regulation Z. See 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.12(b) and

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Action Against Citizens Bank,
N.A.

JAN 30, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed suit
against Citizens Bank, N.A. (Citizens), a national banking association headquartered in
Providence, Rhode Island. The Bureau's complaint alleges violations of the Truth in Lending
Act (TILA) and TILAâs implementing Regulation Z, including violations of amendments to
TILA contained in the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) and the Credit Card Accountability
Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act).

As described in the complaint, the Bureau alleges that for several years Citizens violated
TILA, as amended by the FCBA, and Regulation Z by failing to properly manage and
respond to credit card disputes. The complaint alleges that Citizens automatically denied
consumersâ billing error notices and claims of unauthorized use in certain circumstances.
The complaint further alleges that Citizens failed to fully refund finance charges and fees
when consumers asserted meritorious disputes or fraud claims, and failed to send
consumers required acknowledgement letters and denial notices in response to billing
error notices.

The Bureau further alleges that for several years Citizens violated TILA by violating
provisions passed under the CARD Act. The Bureau alleges that Citizens violated TILA and
Regulation Z by failing to provide credit counseling referrals to consumers who called
Citizensâ toll-free number designated for that purpose. These alleged violations of TILAâ
including those under the FCBA and the CARD Actâand Regulation Z also constitute
violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

The Bureau filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island on
January 30, 2020. The Bureau's complaint seeks, among other remedies, an injunction
against defendants and the imposition of civil money penalties.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has violated the law.

The complaint is available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_citizens-
bank_complaint_2020-01.pdf i (cfob.gov/documents/8428/cfpb_citizens-bank_complaint_

Overview
ClearPath is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides
mortgages guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA). Occasionally, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in
other situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to
provide loans.
ClearPath advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
ClearPath has sent consumers millions of advertisements that violate federal
law because of misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop ClearPath from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

ClearPathâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to veterans and servicemembers.
Since July 2017, ClearPath has mailed millions of mortgage advertisements
to veterans and servicemembers in at least 22 states.

Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of
ClearPathâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through ClearPath.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, ClearPath was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of ClearPathâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), a payment amount, or

closing costs.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, ClearPath represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms.

In fact, ClearPath did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, ClearPath misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, ClearPath was not actually prepared to offer or arrange.

For example, ClearPath advertisements sent to around 260,000 consumers in
November and December 2017 advertised a variable-rate mortgage with a
fixed interest of 2.25% for the first three years and an APR of 3.17%.

In fact, the advertised APR was not correct because it did not take into
account a reasonably current index for the variable-rate period and required
discount points.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account a reasonably current index and required discount

points, was at least 3.516%.

Accordingly, ClearPath misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

In another example, ClearPath advertisements sent to around 80,600
consumers in July 2017 stated âNO Lender Feesâ in bold font in a box titled
âClosing Costs,â along with an advertised APR of 3.17%.

In fact, consumers could not obtain a loan from ClearPath with an APR of
3.17% without paying two discount points at closing. Therefore, the
statement âNO Lender Feesâ was false.

Certain ClearPath mortgage advertisements misleadingly advertised rates or
payments as âfixedâ rates or payments, although the mortgage advertised
was an adjustable-rate or variable-rate mortgage.

For example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in or around
January 2018 used the phrase â30 Year Loan /3 Year Fixedâ next to the
advertised payment on the front. In these advertisements, the phrase
âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not
appear before the first use of the word âfixed,â nor was it at least as

conspicuous as any use of the word âfixedâ in the advertisements.

In these advertisements, despite stating in fine print on the reverse side that
the offer was for an ââadjustable-rate mortgage,â the use of the word âfixedâ
to refer to a rate or payment was not accompanied by an equally prominent
and closely proximate statement of the fact that the rate may vary or the
payment may increase after the first three years.

In another example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in or
around January 2018 contained a box on the top portion of the advertisement
that stated an amount described as âPayment for Next 12 Monthsâ and
directly below that box, another box that stated â30 year Fixedâ in bold font.
The phrase â30 year Fixedâ referred to that stated payment amount.

In fact, the payment amount disclosed was not the same for 30 years. The
payment amount for the first 12 months included a discounted principal and
interest payment plus taxes and insurance and the payment amount for the
remaining 348 months would include full principal and interest plus taxes
and insurance.

In these advertisements, the phrase â30 year Fixedâ was not accompanied by
an equally prominent and closely proximate statement of the fact that the
payment would increase to a higher fixed amount after the first 12 months.
Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence,

nature, or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection

with the mortgage.

Specifically, ClearPath advertisements sent to around 80,600 consumers in
July 2017, advertised both a âVA Streamlineâ mortgage (also known as an
Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan) and a âCash-Outâ refinance
mortgage. The advertisements stated, âNo Equity Required.â The
positioning of that statement on these advertisements implied that it applied

to both of the advertised products, as shown below.

The âNo Equity Requiredâ representation was not accompanied by any
statement indicating that it did not apply to both products.

In fact, while equity in the property may not be required to obtain an Interest
Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, the consumer must have equity in the
property to obtain a cash-out refinance mortgage.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27â44
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Misrepresentations About an Affiliation with the Government
Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements falsely represented that the
sender of the advertisements and the provider of the mortgage product
described in the advertisements was, or was affiliated with, the VA. These
advertisements were written in the form of a notification letter addressed to
the consumer, informing the consumer of his entitlement to and eligibility
for certain VA loan benefitsânamely, the purported lower payment and rate
on a 30-year loan identified in the letter. The letter included the phrases
2017 â Eligibility Notificationâ and âBenefit Allotmentâ in its header, and
assigned a âVA Loan ID Numberâ to the consumerâs existing VA loan. The
letter stated that ClearPath had âimportant information regarding your VA
loan,â that ârecordsâ from the consumerâs city indicated that the consumer
had âyet to take advantage of programs sponsored by The Department of
Veterans Affairs,â and that the consumer was âentitled to a payment and rate
reduction through VA eligibility lending programs.â The letter further stated,
âIt is important you call our VA Loan Service Center toll free (866) 284-
9875 within 21 business days. By taking action now your next mortgage
payment may not be due until April 2018.â

The form of the communicationâa notification letterâand the phrases and

characteristics described in paragraph 47 implied that the sender of the letter

was the VA or an entity affiliated with the VA and that the purported lower
payment and rate listed in the letter were benefits or entitlements being
provided directly by the VA or an entity affiliated with the VA, for which
the consumer was being notified of his or her entitlement and eligibility.
Those representations were false because ClearPathâthe sender of the
advertisements and the provider of the mortgage product described in the
advertisementsâwas not affiliated with the VA or any other governmental
entity.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 47â49
were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Most of ClearPathâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of repayment,
payment amount, or simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of
Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d) and (f), the use of these terms
triggers specific disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did
not include the other disclosures that are required, or did not include them in

the manner required.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual
interest rate more conspicuously than the APR.

Specifically, ClearPath advertisements described in paragraphs 28â31 stated
a simple annual rate of 2.25% in bold font, but the APR was stated below the
simple rate in a smaller font with weaker bolding.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment or the amount of a payment, but did not state the number and
time period of payments associated with the consumerâs repayment
obligations over the full term of the loan.

Specifically, ClearPath advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
around 80,600 consumers in July 2017 stated a payment amount for the first
three years of the loan that was based on a discounted, introductory fixed
rate of 2.25%, but after the first three years, the payment amount would be
based on a variable rate that would adjust annually based on an index and
margin, with annual adjustments capped at 1% per year. While the payment
amount would likely be higher during the variable-rate period than in the
fixed-rate period, these advertisements did not state the number and time
period of payments for the variable-rate period.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual rate of

interest for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply, but:

(A) for variable-rate transactions, failed to state a rate determined by adding
an index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin; (B)
failed to clearly and conspicuously state the period during which each simple
annual rate of interest would apply; or (C) failed to state an accurate APR
for the loan because the stated APR was not based on a reasonably current
index, and thus, was not correctly calculated under Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

For example, ClearPath advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage
described in Paragraph 56 stated a simple rate of interest but failed to
disclose the rate that would apply to the variable-rate period, as determined
by adding a reasonably current index and margin.

Moreover, because these advertisements disclosed an APR that was
calculated using an index that was not reasonably current, they failed to
disclose an APR that complied with the accuracy standards set forth in 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2) and (4).

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state clearly and conspicuously the amount of each
payment that would apply over the term of the loan (e.g., for variable-rate
mortgages, payments based on the application of the sum of a reasonably

current index and margin); the period during which each payment would

apply; or the fact that the advertised payments did not include amounts for
taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation would be greater.

For example, ClearPath advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage
described in Paragraph 56 stated a payment amount based on an introductory
rate of 2.25% that would apply for the first three years, but for the variable-
rate period of the loan, did not disclose a payment amount based on a
reasonably current index and margin.

In another example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in 2018
stated a monthly payment amount in large bold font on the front but did not
contain an equally prominent and closely proximate statement of the period
during which each payment amount would apply.

In another example, over 1.6 million ClearPath advertisements sent to
consumers from March 2018 to September 2019 failed to state, clearly and
conspicuously, that the payments did not include amounts for taxes and
insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment obligation
would be greater.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements used the name of the
consumerâs current lender without disclosing with equal prominence the

name of the person making the advertisement and without including a clear

and conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.

For example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in or around
January 2018 stated the name of the consumerâs current lender in bold font
on the upper left of the advertisement, and in bold and all caps on the
envelope. While ClearPathâs name appeared on the envelope and on the
front of the advertisements, it was in much smaller font than the current
lenderâs name. The advertisements also failed to include a clear and
conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.

ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 23-44,

Interest Rates Other than the APR, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c):
Ifan advertisement states a rate of finance charge, it shall state
the rate as an âannual percentage rate,â using that term. If the
annual percentage rate may be increased after consummation,
the advertisement shall state that fact.... If an advertisement
is for credit secured by a dwelling, the advertisement shall not
state any other rate [other than the APR], except that a simple
annual rate that is applied to an unpaid balance may be stated

in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the

ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(c) because, as described in Paragraphs 53â54,
numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual interest

rate more conspicuously than the APR.
Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect

Misleading Use of the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(1)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24()(1), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the
credit transaction in an advertisement for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will
increase, unless:

(i) In the case of an advertisement solely for one or more
variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ
and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the
rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period.

(ii) In the case of an advertisement solely for non-variable-
rate transactions where the payment will increase (e.g., a
stepped-rate mortgage transaction with an initial lower
payment), each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to the payment
is accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the payment
is fixed, and the fact that the payment will increase after that
period; or

(iii) In the case of an advertisement for both variable-rate
transactions and non-variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage.â or âARMâ appears in the

advertisement with equal prominence as any use of the
term âfixed,â âFixed-Rate Mortgage,â or similar terms;
and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate,
payment, or the credit transaction either refers solely to
the transactions for which rates are fixed and complies
with paragraph (1)(1)i) of this section, if applicable,
or, if it refers to the variable-rate transactions, is
accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the
rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the rate may
vary or the payment may increase after that period.

77. ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(i)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 35â
40, numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will increase used the
word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the credit transaction and did not

advertisement that is not sent by or on behalf of the
consumerâs current lender, unless the advertisement:

VIOLATIONS OF THE MAP RULE (REGULATION N)

Misrepresentations About Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he annual
percentage rate, simple annual rate, periodic rate, or any other rateâ
applicable to a mortgage credit product. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a
misrepresentation is specifically prohibited and is therefore material.
ClearPath violated Â§ 1014.3(b) because, as described in Paragraphs 27-31,
numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations

about the APR applicable to a mortgage credit product.

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.
Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-46, ClearPathâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific APRs, the variable or fixed
nature of rates or payments, lender fees, and required equity, when in fact
those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that

ClearPath was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

ClearPathâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

ClearPathâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or

Therefore, ClearPath engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
Misrepresentations About Government Affiliation

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 47-51, ClearPathâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication that
ClearPath was or was affiliated with the VA or that the advertisement was
sent by or on behalf of the VA.

In fact, ClearPath was not affiliated with the VA and the advertisements
were not sent by or on behalf of the VA.

ClearPathâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.
ClearPathâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were material

because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers.

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule

Under the CFPA, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules
thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. $$ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.
ClearPathâs violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in

from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Eighth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

SEP 14, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against ClearPath Lending, Inc. (ClearPath), a California corporation that is
licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 22 states. ClearPath offers and provides
mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
ClearPathâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail
advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers and veterans. The
Bureau found that ClearPath sent consumers mailers for VA-guaranteed mortgages that
contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked required disclosures,
in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive
acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule), and
Regulation Z. The consent order requires ClearPath to pay a civil money penalty and
imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Today's action is the eighth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of
multiple mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed
mortgages. The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially
unlawful advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of
investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the
financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that ClearPath disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, ClearPath advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including misrepresenting the annual percentage rate applicable to the
advertised mortgage. ClearPath also misleadingly advertised rates or payments as fixed,
even though the advertised mortgage was an adjustable-rate mortgage or the payment was
not fixed for the indicated duration. ClearPath also misrepresented the existence, nature, or
amount of cash or credit available to the consumer, and the existence or amount of fees or
costs to the consumer, in connection with the advertised mortgage. The Bureau also found
that ClearPath advertisements created the false impression that ClearPath was affiliated with
the VA. ClearPath advertisements also failed to properly disclose, when required by
Regulation Z, credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the number and time period
of payments associated with the consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the
loan. Finally, the Bureau found that ClearPath advertisements used the name of the
consumer's lender in a misleading way by not adequately disclosing ClearPathâs name and
the fact that it was not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the consumer's current lender,
as required by Regulation Z.

The consent order against ClearPath requires ClearPath to pay a civil penalty of $625,000.
The consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including
requiring ClearPath to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising
compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with
mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those
identified by the Bureau; and requiring ClearPath to comply with certain enhanced
disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

Commonwealth of Massachusetts ex rel. Maura Healey, Attorney
General (the Commonwealth), bring this action against Commonwealth
Equity Group, LLC (d/b/a Key Credit Repair) (KCR) and Nikitas
Tsoukales (collectively, Defendants) for: (1) deceptive acts or practices
that violate Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act
of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536, and Â§ 2 of the Massachusetts

Consumer Protection Law, M.G.L. c. 938A, Â§ 2 (WA-UDAP); (2) deceptive
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 2 of 27

and abusive telemarketing acts or practices that violate the
Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, 15
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6101-6108, and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 16
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 310.3 & 310.4; and (3) various acts or practices that violate
the Massachusetts Credit Services Organization Law, M.G.L. c. 93,
Â§Â§ 68A-E (MA-CSO). The Bureau and the Commonwealth allege as
follows.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action
because it concerns federal consumer-financial law, 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5565(a)(1), presents a federal question, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and is
brought by an agency of the United States, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345.

2. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the
Commonwealthâs state-law claims because they are so related to the
federal claims that they form part of the same case or controversy. 28
U.S.C. Â§ 1367(a).

3. Venue is proper in this district because Defendants are

located, reside, or do business in this district and because a substantial
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Documenti1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 3 of 27

part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this
district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f); 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(b).
PARTIES

4. The Bureau is an independent agency of the United States.
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5491. The Bureau is charged with enforcing âFederal
consumer financial laws.â 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563 and 5564. The Bureau has
independent litigating authority, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5564(a)-(b), including the
authority to enforce the TSR with respect to the offering or provision of
a consumer-financial product or service under the CFPA, 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 6105(d).

5. Maura Healey is the Attorney General of Massachusetts and
its chief legal officer. Attorney General Healey is charged with, among
other things, enforcing the MA-UDAP and other consumer-protection
laws in the public interest. Indeed, the MA-UDAP created a statutory
mandate for the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute any
entity or person who âis using or is about to use any method, act, or
practice declared by section two [of the MA-UDAP] to be unlawful.â
M.G.L. c. 93A, Â§Â§ 4, 6. Those actions âdeclared .. . to be unlawful by

section twoâ of the MA-UDAP include âunfair methods of competition
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 4 of 27

and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
commerce,â M.G.L. c 938A, Â§Â§ 2, 4, while violations of Â§Â§ 68B to 68E of
the MA-CSO automatically constitute violations of the MA-UDAP.

6. KCRisa lmited-liability company incorporated in
Massachusetts in 2007. Its principal place of business is located at 686
Morton Street, Suite #2, Boston, Massachusetts. Through telemarketing
and tele-sales, KCR offers and purports to provide credit-repair or

because it offers or provides a consumer-financial product or service for
use by consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes
or that is delivered, offered, or provided in connection with such a

operations, finances, marketing, and sales practices.

9.  Tsoukales is a âcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A)

advisory services, including credit counseling and âcollecting, analyzing,
maintaining, or providing consumer report information or other account

consumers, used or expected to be used in connection with any decision
regarding the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or
service.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(15)(A)(v1ii), (1x).

10. Tsoukales is also a ârelated personâ under 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5481(25) because he has managerial responsibility for KCR, and he

materially participates in the conduct of KCRâs affairs. As a related
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 6 of 27

person, Tsoukales is deemed a covered person under the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25).

11. Defendants are âsellersâ under the TSR as that term is
defined by 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(dd) because, in connection with
telemarketing transactions, they provide, offer to provide, or arrange for
others to provide goods or services to customers in exchange for
consideration.

12. KCRisa âtelemarketerâ under the TSR as that term is
defined by 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(ff) because, in connection with

history or ratingâ and âproviding advice or assistanceâ in support

thereof. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68A.
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 7 of 27

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

14. Tsoukales and KCR market and sell credit-repair services to
consumers nationwide.

15. KCR markets itself as providing services that will assist
consumers in removing derogatory information from, or improving, the
consumers credit history, credit record, or credit scores or ratings.

16. KCR conducts telemarketing through receiving inbound
phone calls from consumers.

17. Tsoukales created the scripts that KCRâs telemarketers use
in the sale of KCRâs services, is responsible for the content of KCRâs
websites, and oversees nearly all aspects of KCRâs marketing and
advertising.

18. Tsoukales also interacts directly with consumers and KCRâs
customers, and he has made representations to consumers related to
KCRâs credit-repair services before, during, and after their enrollment
with the company.

19. Since 2008, KCR has enrolled tens of thousands of
consumers. From 2016 through 2019, KCR enrolled nearly 40,000

consumers nationwide.
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 8 of 27

20. Since January 2011, KCR has collected at least $23,000,000
in fees from consumers.

21. Since January 2011, KCR has enrolled roughly 12,616
Massachusetts consumers.

22. KCR requires that consumers pay what it calls a âfirst work
feeâ of between $99.95 and $159.95 or more within five days of enrolling
with the company.

23. KCR then charges consumers monthly fees of $99.95 to
$159.95 or more, depending on the service level the consumer chooses.
KCR also adds an âexpedited billing processing feeâ of at least $6.50 to
the monthly fees.

24. KCR collects these fees from consumers before achieving the
promised credit-repair results.

25. As CSOs, Defendants are prohibited from charging any
advance feesânamely, any fee charged before âfull, complete and
satisfactory performanceâ of the credit-repair services offeredâunless
two conditions are met. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B. First, the CSO must obtain
a surety bond in the amount of at least $10,000 issued by a company

authorized to do business in Massachusetts. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B(1).
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 9 of 27

Second, the CSO must establish a trust account at a âfederally insured
bank or savings and loan association located in [Massachusetts].â Jd.

26. While Defendants appear to maintain a $10,000 surety bond
written by Western Surety Company, they do not have a trust account
of any kind.

27. Since at least 2017, KCR has made representations about its
credit-repair services on its website, in online advertising, and in its
customer agreements.

28. For example, as of early March 2020, KCRâs website
included the following representations:

a. âour team of more than 60 credit experts help[s] each
and every client individuallyâ to âtake the next steps towards
credit freedom;â and

b.  âfo]ur consultations are all done by our owner, Nik
Tsoukales, and his team of certified credit consultants.â

29. KCR, however, has just a handful of Boston-based
employees, only some of whom interact directly with consumers. The
majority of KCRâs sales and client interactions are conducted by

contract telemarketers located in Central America who are
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 10 of 27

compensated almost entirely by commission, based on the number of
clients they enroll in KCRâs programs.

30. In addition, in December 2018, KCRâs website included the

following representations:

31. In many instances, however, KCR did not fix unlimited
amounts of negative items on clientsâ credit files. And most clients did

not see credit scores with an âaverage 90 point increase in 90 days.â

10
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 11 of 27

32. Another KCR advertisement published online in September

2018 stated:

 

Clients start seeing
removals in as little as
A5 days.

 

 

 

33. In many instances, however, consumers did not see removals
on their credit reports within 45 days of enrolling with KCR.
34. Other advertisements published on KCRâs website from at
least January 2018 to at least March 2019 represented that KCR
would assist consumers in removing derogatory information from, or
improving, the consumersâ credit record, including:
a. âWe dramatically increase credit scores to help

consumers that are struggling to get approved;â

11
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 12 of 27

b. âWe help people whose low credit scores are holding
them back from the life they want;â and
C. âClean Up Unlimited Negative Records.â

35. In many instances, however, KCR did not dramatically
increase consumers credit scores and did not clean up unlimited
negative records on behalf of consumers.

36. KCRâs representations have led consumers to believe that if
they paid for KCRâs services, the company would help improve their
credit scores or remove derogatory information from their credit reports.

37. In many instances, however, KCR failed to deliver the
promised results, and consumers did not see their credit scores

improved or negative items removed from their credit reports.

COUNT I

Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 13 of 27

derogatory information from, or improve, a personâs credit history,
credit record, or credit rating, until:
a. the timeframe in which the seller has represented that
all of the goods or services will be provided to that person
has expired; and
b. the seller has provided the person with documentation
in the form of a consumer report from a consumer-reporting
agency demonstrating that the promised results have been
achieved, such report having been issued more than six
months after the results were achieved. 16 C.F.R.
Â§ 310.4(a)(2).
40. Defendants have made representations to consumers that
their credit-repair services would remove derogatory information from,
or improve, the consumersâ credit histories, credit reports, or credit

ratings.

13
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 14 of 27

41. Defendants routinely requested and received payment of a
fee or consideration for their credit-repair services before:
a. the timeframe in which they represented that all of
their goods or services would be provided to the consumer
expired; and
b. they provided the consumer with documentation in the
form of a consumer report from a consumer-reporting agency
demonstrating that the promised results were achieved, such
report having been issued more than six months after the
results were achieved.
42. Therefore, Defendants have engaged in abusive
telemarketing acts or practices that violated 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(2).

for a seller or telemarketer to misrepresent any material aspect of the

performance, efficacy, nature, or central characteristics of its services.

16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(a)(2)(ii).

14
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 15 of 27

45. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have represented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that KCRâs actions
would or likely would result in a substantial increase to consumersâ
credit scores.

46. But, in numerous instances, KCRs actions did not result in a
substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

47. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have represented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that KCRâs actions
would or likely would result in the removal of negative entries on
consumers credit reports.

48. But, in numerous instances, KCRs actions did not result in
the removal of negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

49. These representations have been material and likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

50. Because Defendants are sellers or telemarketers under the

TSR, these misrepresentations about the performance, efficacy, nature,

15
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 16 of 27

or central characteristics of KCRâs services violated the TSR. 16 C.F.R.
Â§ 310.3(a)(2)(iu1).

COUNT III
TSR Violations Constitute Violations of the CFPA

51. The allegations in paragraphs | to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

52. Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or
service provider to commit any act or omission in violation of a âFederal
consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

53. Any violation of the TSR that is committed by a person
subject to the CFPA shall be treated as a violation of a rule under
Â§ 1031 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531, regarding unfair, deceptive, or
abusive acts or practices. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6102(c)(2).

54. Therefore, any violation of the TSR by a covered person is
also a violation of the CFPA.

55. Because Defendants are covered persons and have

committed an act or omission in violation of the TSR, they also violated

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

16
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 17 of 27

COUNT IV
Deceptive Acts or Practices That Violate the CFPA

56. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

57. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in a substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

58. But, in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in
a substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

59. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in the removal of material negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

60. But in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in

the removal of negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

17
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 18 of 27

61. These representations regarding KCRâs services were
material and likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

62. Therefore, Defendantsâ representations as described herein
were false and misleading and constituted deceptive acts or practices in
violation of Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536.

COUNT V
TSR and CFPA Violations
Constitute Violations of the MA-UDAP

63. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

64. Under the MA-UDAP, violations of federal consumer-
protection laws such as the TSR and CFPA constitute violations of Â§ 2 of
the MA-UDAP, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in
the conduct of business in Massachusetts. 940 CMR 3.16; M.G.L. c. 93A,
Â§ 2.

65. Therefore, any violation of the TSR or CFPA by a person or

entity that conducts business in Massachusetts is also a violation of the

MA-UDAP.

18
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 19 of 27

66. Because Defendants committed acts or omissions that
violated the TSR and CFPA, they also violated the MA-UDAPâs ban on
unfair or deceptive acts or practices.

COUNT VI
Defendants Operate in Open
Violation of Numerous Requirements of the MA-CSO

67. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

68. As CSOs, in order to charge any advance fees, Defendants
are required to maintain a $10,000 surety bond written by a company
authorized to do business in Massachusetts and establish and maintain
a trust account with a Massachusetts bank or savings and loan
institution. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B(1). Defendants have not met these
requirements, yet they continually charge monthly service and other
fees to consumers before fully and completely performing the promised
credit-repair services, in violation of the MA-CSO.

69. In addition, before execution of a contract and before the
receipt of money or valuable consideration from a consumer, CSOs must

disclose in writing âa complete and detailed description of the services

to be performed by the [CSO] and the total cost to the buyer for such

19
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 20 of 27

services.â M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68C(5). And every CSO service agreement or
contract must set forth âthe terms and conditions of payment, including
the total of all payments to be made by the buyer, whether to the [CSO]
or to some other person.â M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68D(c) (emphasis added).

70. Finally, before execution of a contract and before the receipt
of money or valuable consideration from a consumer, CSOs are required
to provide consumers with a written statement âasserting the buyerâs
right to proceed against the surety bond or trust account required under
[Â§ 68B of the MA-CSO]â along with the name and business address of
any such surety company and trust-account depository, together with
the name of the trustee and the account number. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68C(6)-
(7).

71. Defendantsâ credit-service agreement (CSA)âtheir written
contract with consumersâdoes not set forth the âtotal cost to the buyerâ
or âthe total of all payments to be made by the buyer.â Instead, KCRâs
CSAs are open-ended, highlighting that âthe client understands that
they are paying on a month to month basis.â The CSA discloses only the
first-work fee, to be paid within five days, and the monthly service fee

plus âexpedited billing processing fee,â both of which are to be charged

20
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 21 of 27

âeach subsequent monthâ after the first-work fee. These charges
continue indefinitely until the consumer cancels the agreement in
writing.

72. Defendantsâ CSA also fails to alert the consumer to his or
her right to proceed against the relevant surety bond or trust account
and fails to disclose the contact and other information for those entities,
as required by the MA-CSO.

73. By failing to establish the required trust account and failing
to disclose in writing the various required elements, as detailed above,
Defendants violated Â§Â§ 68B(1), 68C(5)-(7) and 68D(c) of the MA-CSO.
See M.G.L. c. 93, Â§Â§ 68A-E.

COUNT VII
Untrue or Misleading Representations and Acts Intended
to Defraud or Deceive Buyers in Violation of the MA-CSO

74. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

75. The MA-CSO prohibits CSOs from making or using any

âuntrue or misleading representations in the offer or sale of [credit

services] or from engag[ing], directly or indirectly, in any act, practice or

21
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 22 of 27

course of business intended to defraud or deceive a buyer in connection
with the offer or sale of such services.â M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B(4).

76. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in a substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores, often within a
specified period.

77. But, in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in
a substantial increase, or any increase, to consumersâ credit scores, and
any increase often occurred outside the promised timeframe.

78. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in the removal of material negative entries on consumersâ credit reports,

often within a specified period.

22
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 23 of 27

79. But, in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in
the removal of negative entries on consumersâ credit reports, and to the
extent that some portion of such negative entries were removed, this
often occurred outside the promised timeframe.

80. These representations regarding KCRâs services were
material and likely to deceive or mislead consumers acting reasonably
under the circumstances.

81. Therefore, Defendantsâ representations as described herein
were âuntrue or misleadingâ or âintended to defraud or deceiveâ
consumers in violation of Â§ 68B(4) of M.G.L. c. 93.

COUNT VIII
Defendantsâ CSO Violations
Constitute Violations of the MA-UDAP

82. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

83. A violation of any section of the MA-CSO relating to the
conduct of credit-services organizations in Massachusetts (1.e., Â§Â§ 68B to

68D of M.G.L. c. 93) âshall [also] constitute a violation ofâ the MA-

UDAP.

23
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 24 of 27

84. Because Defendants violated the MA-CSO, as detailed in
Counts VI and VII, they also violated the MA-UDAPâs ban on unfair or

deceptive acts or practices.

COUNT IX
Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices That Violate the MA-UDAP

85. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

86. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in a substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

87. But in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result ina
substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

88. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material

misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair

24
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 25 of 27

services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in the removal of material negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

89. But in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in
the removal of negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

90. These representations regarding KCRâs services have been
material and likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

91. Therefore, Defendantsâ representations as described herein
were false and misleading and constitute deceptive acts or practices
that violated Â§ 2 of the MA-UDAP.

DEMAND FOR RELIEF

The Bureau and the Commonwealth request that the Court, as
permitted by 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565, the MA-CSO, and the MA-UDAP:

a. impose appropriate injunctive relief against
Defendants for their violations of the CFPA, the TSR,
the MA-UDAP, and the MA-CSO;

b. srant additional injunctive relief as the Court may

deem to be just and proper;

C. award damages and other monetary relief against
Defendants as the Court finds necessary to redress
injury to consumers resulting from Defendantsâ
violations of the CFPA, the TSR, the MA-UDAP, and

contracts, the refund of monies paid, restitution,
disgorgement, or compensation for unjust enrichment;

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Commonwealth of Massachusetts File
Suit Against Credit-Repair Telemarketers

MAY 22, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey today jointly filed a
lawsuit against Commonwealth Equity Group, LLC, which does business as Key Credit
Repair, and Nikitas Tsoukales (also known as Nikitas Tsoukalis), Key Credit Repairâs
president and owner. As alleged in the complaint, from 2016 through 2019 alone, Key
Credit Repair enrolled nearly 40,000 consumers nationwide, and since 2011, it collected at
least $23 million in fees from consumers. The Bureau alleges that in their telemarketing of
credit-repair services, the defendants violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act's
(CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices and the Telemarketing Sales Ruleâs
(TSR) prohibitions on deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices.

The Bureau and Massachusettsâs complaint, filed in the federal district court for the District
of Massachusetts, specifically alleges that the defendants deceptively misrepresent that Key
Credit Repairâs actions will or likely will result in a substantial increase to consumersâ credit
scores and the removal of material negative entries on consumersâ credit reports when, in
fact, in numerous instances, Key Credit Repair did not achieve those results. The Bureau
alleges that those misrepresentations are deceptive acts or practices in violation of the
CFPA and the TSR. The Bureau further alleges that Key Credit Repair and Tsoukales
engaged in abusive acts or practices in violation of the TSR by requesting and receiving
payment for their credit-repair services before achieving the promised results and before
giving consumers a consumer report more than six months after achieving the results to
demonstrate the results. The Bureau further alleges that the alleged violations of the TSR
also constitute violations of the CFPA.

The complaint seeks redress to consumers, an injunction, and the imposition of civil money
penalties.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.
The Bureauâs investigation was conducted in partnership with Massachusetts.

A copy of the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts is available here:

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

4.

Respondent is a financial services company headquartered in Irving, Texas.

Respondent owns and operates approximately 340 locations across the following states:
Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.

Respondent makes or, in certain states, assists consumers in obtaining, short-term, small-
dollar loans, including payday, installment, and auto title loans. Since at least 2013,
Respondent has offered multiple-payment loans in varying amounts, with installment
payments due periodically. Respondent also makes or, in certain states, assists consumers
in obtaining, loans secured by consumersâ vehicles and unsecured, short-term, single-
installment loans.

Respondent is a covered person under the CFPA because it is in the business of making
consumer loans and collecting debt related to such loans. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), (15)(A)q),
(15)(A)(X).

Respondent is a creditor under TILA and Regulation Z to the extent that it regularly
extends consumer credit that is payable by agreement in more than four installments or
for which the payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and is the person to
whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the
face of the evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such evidence of indebtedness, by

agreement. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1602(g); 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(17).
10.

11.

12.

13.

14.

15.

16.

17.

Respondent is a person under FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681a(b).

Respondent furnishes information relating to consumers to CRAs for inclusion in
consumer reports. Respondent is therefore a furnisher under Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§
1022.41(c).

Findings and Conclusions as to Unfair Collection Call Practices

As part of its loan-application process, Respondent asked consumers to list their primary
telephone number and to provide the names and contact information for at least two
references.

As references, consumers often identified their employers, family, or friends, and listed
their employersâ telephone numbers, along with the telephone numbers of family or
friends.

When consumers failed to make payments on loans originated by Respondent, it
frequently made numerous calls to the consumers themselves, their employers, and other
third parties.

Respondent called some consumers more than 15 times daily, and a smaller portion more
than 20 times daily.

Until at least December 2015, Respondent routinely called consumersâ employers,
consumersâ other references, and other third parties as a tactic to obtain payments from
the consumer rather than when unable to locate the consumer.

In numerous instances when making such calls, Respondent disclosed to third parties, or
risked disclosing to third parties, the existence of consumersâ delinquent debts.

In some instances, Respondent called consumersâ workplaces multiple times a day, even
after being told that the consumers were not allowed to receive calls at work and that

future calls could endanger their employment.
18.

19.

20.

21.

22.

23.

In some instances, Respondent called consumersâ references or other third parties it
thought might be related to consumers even after being asked to stop.

Respondentâs acts or practices have caused or were likely to cause substantial injury to
the consumers from whom it sought to collect and to third parties. Respondentâs repeated
calls to consumersâ workplaces caused or were likely to cause consumers harm including
disciplinary action from employers, lost productivity and wages, and other negative
employment consequences.

Respondentâs high volume of calls to consumers also caused or was likely to cause harm
to consumers as the repeated calls aggravated, annoyed, and distressed consumers.
Respondentâs calling practices also caused or were likely to cause harm to persons who
acted as third-party references.

Consumers, including the third parties who Respondent contacted, could not reasonably
have avoided the harm because they did not know whether, when, or how these calls
might occur and had no control over Respondentâs use of these collection tactics.
Consumers had no way of knowing Respondent would engage in such conduct before
entering the loan transaction as Respondent does not disclose in its loan agreements that
it will use these collection tactics if a loan becomes delinquent.

The injury resulting from these calls is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to
consumers or competition. Many other means to collect debt that do not disrupt
consumersâ workplaces or otherwise harm consumers are available to Respondent. Any
marginal benefit to consumers or to competition stemming from additional recoveries by
Respondent is outweighed by substantial injury or likelihood of injury to consumers

resulting from these practices.
24.

25.

206.

27.

28.

29.

Respondentâs acts or practices therefore constitute unfair acts or practices in violation of
the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Television Marketing

Before June 2015, certain television advertising by Respondent stated that consumers
could save 50% on finance charges.

In fact, Respondent did not give consumers who responded to the advertisements a 50%
discount on all of the finance charges associated with the loan.

Instead, consumers would pay the first finance charge in full. Consumers would then
receive a 50% rebate of that charge, which was mailed to them some time later.
Consumers were required to pay 100% of the remaining finance charges and received no
rebates of those payments.

Certain of Respondentâs television advertisements ended with a screen displaying text
urging consumers to call Respondent and âSave 50%â in large font at the top of the
screen. Underneath, the screen included fine print text indicating that the promised
discount was available only as a rebate, and applied only to the finance charge for the first
scheduled payment. At the same time, the advertisements included voice-overs telling
viewers to call now and âsave up to 50%,â or other substantially similar language, without
reference to the limitations on the purported discount.

Respondentâs representations in the advertisements were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably because they presented the false impression that consumers would only
have to pay 50% of a loanâs finance charges. In fact, consumers actually had to pay all of
the finance charges on these loans; the discount code provided them the opportunity to
receive a rebate after they made their first scheduled payment, and then only of 50% of

the finance charge portion of that payment.

36.

From January 1, 2013 to June 1, 2015, more than 1,200 consumers redeemed codes
related to Respondentâs misleading television ads.

The statements in these television advertisements were material because they related to
the cost of Respondentâs loan products.

Respondentâs representations set forth above constitute deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Telemarketing Calls

From at least January 2013 through January 2015, Respondent made thousands of
marketing calls promoting its supposed 50% discounts after consumers expressed interest
in a loan online.

When Respondentâs telemarketers mentioned the discount, they typically described it as a
50% discount on the finance charge payment, and in most cases failed to mention the
limitations that it would apply only to finance charges applicable to the first payment due,
that it would be paid as a rebate, and that it would be provided only if the first payment
was received in full on or before the due date.

Respondentâs telemarketing agents did not direct consumers to review any disclosures
related to the offer, and often encouraged consumers to write down the discount code,
which the agents provided orally, without directing them to go to their website where the
consumer might have seen the disclosures associated with the website coupon.
Respondentâs representations in these calls misled or were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably because they presented the false impression that consumers would only
have to pay 50% of a loanâs finance charges. In fact, consumers had to pay all of the

finance charges on these loans; the discount code provided them the opportunity to
37.

38.

receive a rebate after they made their first scheduled payment, and then only of 50% of
the finance charge portion of that payment.

Respondentâs statements were material because they related to the cost of Respondentâs
loan products.

Respondentâs representations set forth above constitute deceptive acts or practices in

violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Failure to Establish Consumer Reporting

42.

43.

Policies and Procedures

Respondent furnishes information relating to consumers to one or more CRAs for
inclusion in a consumer report. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.41(c). It is therefore a furnisher under
Regulation V.

Regulation V requires a furnisher to establish and implement reasonable written policies
and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to
consumers that it furnishes to a consumer reporting agency. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(a).
Regulation V also requires furnishers to consider the guidelines provided in Appendix E
when developing its policies and procedures and to incorporate those guidelines that are
appropriate. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(b).

Regulation V also requires each furnisher to review its policies and procedures
periodically and update them as necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness. 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(c).

Between 2013 and 2015, Respondent furnished informationâincluding loan amount,
consumerâs loan status, whether the loan was in default, and whether the consumer had

disputed the debt in some way or entered into bankruptcyâfor about 20,000 accounts.
44,

45.

46.

47.

From at least January 2013 to May 2015, Respondent did not have reasonable written
policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the consumer
information that it furnished to CRAs, nor did it consider federal guidelines in developing
its policies and procedures as required by federal law.

Respondent failed to review its policies and procedures periodically and update them as
necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness.

Respondent therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(a)-(c).

Respondentâs violations of the FCRA and Regulation V constitute violations of the

CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Findings and Conclusions as to Inadequate Disclosures of the APR in Telemarketing Calls

48.

49.

50.

S1.

52.

53.

Respondent is a creditor under Regulation Z. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1602(g); 12 C.F.R. Â§
1026.2(a)(17).

Respondentâs telemarketers call consumers who have expressed interest in a loan online.
From January 1, 2013 through July 2015, Respondent made hundreds of thousands of
telemarketing calls to consumers.

TILA requires that when creditors respond orally to consumersâ inquiries about the cost of
closed-end credit (for example, the interest rate), they must disclose the cost as an APR.
15 U.S.C. Â§ 1665a; 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.26(b).

Often, when consumers asked Respondentâs telemarketing agents about the interest on
loans or other questions relating to cost, the agents responded orally but failed to provide
the APR as required by federal law.

Respondentâs call scripts provided no guidance on how to answer a consumerâs question

about the interest rate or other costs of the loan.

2020-BCFP-0001 Document1 Filed 04/01/2020 Page 11 of 29

In September 2014, a member of Respondentâs compliance team raised, in writing, a
concern that Respondentâs lack of guidance about how to lawfully disclose a loanâs cost
and APR could result in violations of TILA. Respondent did not revise or update its
script, nor provide further guidance to telemarketers in response to this issue.
The failure to state the APR when orally responding to consumersâ questions about the
costs of the loans violates Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.26.
Respondentâs violations of TILA and Regulation Z constitute violations of the CFPA. 12
ULS.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

ORDER

V
Conduct Provisions

IT IS ORDERED, under sections 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, that:

following affirmative actions:
a. Respondent, whether acting directly or indirectly, is permanently restrained from:
1. Engaging in collections conduct the consequence of which is to

worker, or third-party reference, unless the consumer, after default,
provided his or her documented, voluntary, affirmative, and
specific permission on an opt-in basis for the third-party

communication.

Respondent, and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who

have actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or indirectly, in

connection with the advertising, marketing, promotion, offering for sale, sale, or

performance of any consumer financial product or service, may not misrepresent,

or assist others in misrepresenting, expressly or impliedly:

1.

ii.

iii.

The terms of any discounts it offers, including in its television
advertisements and telemarketing calls with consumers;

Clearly and Prominently discloses the limitations of the discount;
or

That any discount provides for a reduction in the cost of a product,
including that it provides a certain percentage âoffâ the cost of a

product, unless the discount reduces the payments due from the
consumer, or, if the discount is provided via a rebate, the
representation Clearly and Prominently discloses that the discount
is in the form of a rebate.
Respondent and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who have
actual notice of this Consent Order, and whether acting directly or indirectly, may
not violate the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1681-1681x, and its implementing regulation,
Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. pt. 1022, and must take the following affirmative actions:
within 90 days of the Effective Date, Respondent will review its written policies
and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to
consumers that it furnishes to CRAs, to confirm that they comply with Regulation
V, and update them as necessary to comply. In so doing, Respondent must

il. Review and update as necessary, and implement, policies and
procedures that include specific instructions on how to respond
orally to an inquiry about the cost of a loan product with the APR.
At aminimum, the policies and procedures for TILA compliance
will require that Respondent examine a randomly selected sample
of telemarketing calls, which at Respondent's discretion may be
live or recorded, for failures to properly disclose the APR of a loan
product on a monthly basis using industry-accepted standards for
selection and testing. If telemarketing agents are identified as
having violated TILA, Respondent will require those agents to
participate in additional TILA compliance training.

IV. Respondent will fully implement the TILA compliance policies
and procedures within 120 days of the Effective Date.

Nothing in this Consent Order shall be read as an exception to this Paragraph.

The Bureau may use these remaining funds to pay additional redress to Affected

Consumers. If the Bureau determines, in its sole discretion, that additional redress is

wholly or partially impracticable or otherwise inappropriate, or if funds remain after the

additional redress is completed, the Bureau will deposit any remaining funds in the U.S.

Treasury as disgorgement. Respondent will have no right to challenge any actions that the

Bureau or its representatives may take under this Section.

Respondent may not condition the payment of any redress to any Affected Consumer

under this Consent Order on that Affected Consumer waiving any right.

12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a civil money penalty of $1,100,000 to the

Bureau.

Respondent must make the following payments by wire transfer to the Bureau or the

Bureauâs agent, in compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions, to satisfy the

5497(d).

Respondent must treat the civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order as a penalty

paid to the government for all purposes. Regardless of how the Bureau ultimately uses

those funds, Respondent may not:

a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax benefit for
any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, rermbursement or indemnification from any
source, including but not limited to payment made under any insurance policy,

with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order.

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related Consumer
Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to, nor may Respondent
benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory monetary remedies imposed in
the Related Consumer Action because of the civil money penalty paid in this action. If
the court in any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of
compensatory monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil
Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such
offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the
U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty

and will not change the amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

73.

74.

75.

In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment under this
Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as amended, will accrue on
any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of default to the date of payment, and
will immediately become due and payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid to the fullest
extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must furnish to the
Bureau its taxpayer identifying numbers, which may be used for purposes of collecting

and reporting on any delinquent amount arising out of this Consent Order.

97.

The provisions of this Consent Order do not bar, estop, or otherwise prevent the Bureau,

except as described in Paragraph 95.

The Bureau releases and discharges Respondent from all potential liability for law
violations that the Bureau has or might have asserted based on the practices described in
Section IV of this Consent Order, to the extent such practices occurred before the
Effective Date and the Bureau knows about them as of the Effective Date. The Bureau
may use the practices described in this Consent Order in future enforcement actions
against Respondent and its affiliates, including, without limitation, to establish a pattern or
practice of violations or the continuation of a pattern or practice of violations or to
calculate the amount of any penalty. This release does not preclude or affect any right of
the Bureau to determine and ensure compliance with the Consent Order, or to seek
penalties for any violations of the Consent Order.

This Consent Order is intended to be, and will be construed as, a final Consent Order
issued under section 1053 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5563, and expressly does not form,

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Short-Term Lender for Unfair
and Deceptive Acts and Practices

APR 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau)
announced a settlement with Cottonwood Financial, Ltd., which does business under the
name Cash Store. Cash Store is based in Irving, Texas and owns and operates roughly 340
retail lending outlets in Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.
The Bureau found that in the course of marketing, servicing, and collecting on high-interest
payday, auto-title, and unsecured consumer-installment loans Cash Store violated the
Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and Truth in
Lending Act (TILA). The consent order requires Cash Store to pay over $1.3 million in
redress and penalties.

Specifically, the Bureau found that Cash Store made deceptive representations in its
television advertisements and telemarketing calls when promoting â50%-off"" all of its loan
fees when it did not in fact provide that discount. Cash Store engaged in unfair practices by
repeatedly calling consumersâ workplaces and references after being asked to stop and not
for purposes of locating consumers, disclosing the delinquency of consumersâ debts to third
parties or using tactics that risked such disclosure, and making excessive calls to consumers
that aggravated, annoyed, and distressed consumers. Cash Store violated the FCRA by
failing to maintain adequate policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity
of the information it furnished to consumer reporting agencies, potentially affecting about
20,000 consumer accounts. Cash Store also violated TILA by failing to provide the annual
percentage rate to consumers when they inquired over the phone about the cost of their
loans.

The consent order issued against Cash Store requires it to provide $286,675.64 in redress
to over 1,200 borrowers whom Cash Store falsely promised 50% off all fees. The consent
order requires Cash Store to pay a civil money penalty of $1,100,000 to the Bureauâs Civil
Penalty Fund. The consent order also prohibits Cash Store from certain collection practices
and requires it to ensure that its employees respond accurately when asked about loan
costs.

or serviceâ within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. $ 548 1C15)(A\G), and

CFPA; and (4) Respondent violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, IS U.S.C. Â§ 1692, et seq., through its collection activities on
certain defaulted student loans.

Approximately two years after the 2015 Consent Order was issued, in
September 2017, Respondent began the migration of its student loan
servicing platform to anew system.

Respondent migrated approximately 1.5 million loans for
approximately 778,000 borrowers to the new system during the
Migration.

The Migration resulted in hundreds of Migration Issues that harmed
tens of thousands of consumers andresulted in numerous Consent
Order Violations.

In September 2017, the Bureau examined Respondent to assess
Respondent's compliance with the 2015 Consent Order.

Respondent knew shortly after the Migration that many Migration
Issues were leading to potential Consent Order Violations.

Although Respondent was aware of potential Consent Order
Violations arising from the Migration while Bureau examiners were

on-site examining Respondentâs compliance with the 2015 Consent

Order, Respondent did not report these violations to the Bureau at that
time.
While Bureau examiners were on-site, Respondent was also aware of
other potential Consent Order Violations that occurred before the
Bureauâs examination that were unrelated to the Migration.
Respondent did not report these potential pre-Migration Consent
Order Violations tothe Bureau while Bureau examiners were on-site.
Respondentâs representations to the Bureau during the examination
about its compliance with the 2015 Consent Order were incomplete
and misleading.

Respondent violated the 2015 Consent Order as described herein.
Each ofits violations of the 2015 Consent Order constitutes a
violation of Section 5536(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§
5536(a)(1)(A).

Misrepresentations of the Minimum Periodic Payment

 

Paragraph 49(b)(1) of the 2015 Consent Order states that Respondent
âmay not misrepresent. .. the minimum periodic payment owed by
consumers|.]â

While the 2015 Consent Order was in effect, Respondent made
misrepresentations to more than 100,000 consumers about the
minimum periodic paymentthese consumers owed. Respondent made
these misrepresentations in mailed account statements, letters, online,
and on phonecalls.

Most ofthese misrepresentations occurred as a result of the Migration.
In these communications, Respondent either overstated or understated
the minimum periodic payment owed by consumers.

Consumers were harmed by Respondentâs misrepresentations of the
minimum periodic payment owed, resulting in some consumers

paying more or less than the correct monthly amount, andsome

consumers may have become late or delinquent because they could
not pay the amount they believed was the minimum amount due.
Respondentâs numerous misrepresentations of the minimum periodic
payment due from consumers violate Paragraph 49(b)(1) of the 2015
Consent Order, and thus also violate Section 5536(a)(1)(A) ofthe
CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Misrepresentations of the Amount of Interest Paid

 

Paragraph 49(b)(i1) of the 2015 Consent Order states that Respondent
âmay not misrepresent... the amount of interest paid by
consumers|.]â

The tax code allows student loan interest, up to $2,500, to be deducted
as an adjustment to income for some taxpayers.

While the Consent Order was in effect, Respondent misrepresented to
more than 8,000 consumers the amount of interest they had paid in
1098E tax forms, letters, online, or over the phone.

Most ofthese misrepresentations occurred as a result of the Migration.
In the misrepresentations, Respondent either overstated or understated
the amount of interest paid by consumers.

Respondent misrepresented the amount of interest consumers had paid

by amounts ranging from less than $100 to more than $40,000, and

10
33.

34.

35.

36.

37.

2020-BCFP-0026 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 11 of 54

which could have impacted consumersâ student loan interest
deductions by as much as $2,500.

By misrepresenting the am ount of interest consumers paid,
Respondent may have caused consumers to claim an inaccurate
student loan interest deduction, which could lead to financial harm,
including causing consumers not to claim their allowable deduction,
not to claim their maximum allowable deduction, or to chooseto refile
their taxes.

Respondentâs numerous misrepresentations of the amount of interest
paid by consumers violate Paragraph 49(b)(11) of the 2015 Consent
Order, and thus also violate Section 5536(a)(1)(A) ofthe CFPA, 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Misrepresentations of Other Material Facts

 

Paragraph 49(b)(ii1) of the 2015 Consent Order states that Respondent
âmay not misrepresent... any other fact material to consumers
concerning the servicing of theirloans.â

While the 2015 Consent Order was in effect, Respondent
misrepresented multiple other facts material to the terms and servicing
of consumersâ student loans to more than 390,000 consumers.

Most of these misrepresentations occurred as a result of the Migration.

11
38.

39.

40.

2020-BCFP-0026 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 12 of 54

These misrepresentations to consumers were material because they
related to important facts about consumersâ loans that could influence
consumersâ decisions about their loans. For example, Respondent
misrepresented (a) the amount of interest some consumers owed due
to charging incorrect interest rates or incorrectly capitalizing interest,
(b) the applicable interest rate, (c) how payments would be allocated
by failing to properly apply consumersâ payments, (d) the due date,
amount due, or whether a payment was past due, (e) repayment
information, and (f) the availability of a reward or a discount, among
other things.

Respondentâs numerous misrepresentations of material facts violate
Paragraph 49(b)(1i1) of the 2015 Consent Order, and thus also violate
Section 5536(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Failure to Pay Redress Required by 2015 Consent Order

 

Paragraph 58(c) of the 2015 Consent Order requires Respondent to
remediate consumers to whom it placed six or more attempted calls or
contacts before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. in the time zone where the

consumer resides.

Respondent improperly excluded consumers it had called between
January 29, 2014 and July 21, 2015 from the population of consumers
it remediated.

Respondent initially failed to remediate up to 777 consumers owed
money under the 2015 Consent Order.

Respondent later rem ediated these consumers, more than two years
after the 2015 Consent Order was issued, after the Bureau questioned
Respondent about its failure to remediate this population.

By failing to provide this remediation until more than two years after
the 2015 Consent Order was issued, Respondent violated Paragraph
58(c) of the 2015 Consent Order, and thus violated of Section
5536(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Deceptive Acts and Practices

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Misrepresentations of the Minimum Periodic Payment

 

As described in paragraphs 21 through 26, Respondentâs numerous
misrepresentations of the minimum periodic payment owed by

consumers constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of

13
47.

48.

2020-BCFP-0026 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 14 of 54

Sections 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B) ofthe CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Misrepresentations of the Amount of Interest Paid

 

As described in paragraphs 27 through 34, Respondentâs numerous
misrepresentations of the amount of interest paid by consumers
constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of Sections 103 1(a)

and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 (a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Unfair Acts and Practices

As aresult of the Migration, which began in September 2017,
Respondent withdrew automatic payments from more than 17,000
consumersâ bank accounts without proper authorization.
Respondentâs actions included:

a. In some instances, Respondent withdrew automatic payment
amounts that were higherthan the amounts specified in
consumersâ billing statements;

b. â In some instances, Respondent withdrew unauthorized
automatic payments without providing notice to consumers in
advance; and

C. In some instances, Respondent withdrew the same automatic

paymenttwice.

As aresult of Respondentâs actions described in paragraph 48,
consumers were deprived the use of their funds and may have
incurred NSF and overdratt charges or other fees.

In addition, for more than 14,000 consumers, Respondent cancelled,
or failed to withdraw, automatic payments without providing notice to
consumers.

As aresult of Respondentâs actions described in paragraph 50,
Respondent incorrectly placed some of the 14,000 consumers in a
delinquency status, caused some consumersâ loans to accrue excess
interest, and deprived consumers of certain interest rate benefits.
Section 1036(a)(1)(B) ofthe CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)B). An act or
practice 1s unfair if it causes or is likely to cause consumers
substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable and ifthe
substantial injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to
consumers orto competition.

Respondentâs practice of withdrawing automatic payments from
consumersâ accounts without a valid authorization and cancelling or
failing to withdraw automatic payments without providing noticeto

consumers caused substantial injury to consumers that was not

15

reasonably avoidable or outweighed by any countervailing benefit to

34. Thus, Respondent engaged in untair acts and practices mn violation of
Sections 1036(ay1)(B) and LO3 l(c LoftheCPPA. 12 U.S.C. $$
5536(ay 1B), 553 1(c\I).

Violations of EF TA and Regulation E

55. The automatic payments described in paragraphs 48 to 51 above are
known as electronic funds transfers (EFTs) under the Electronic Fund
Transter Act (EFTA), 15 U.S.C. $ 1693, ef seq.

56. EPTA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693e(a), and its implementing Regulation EH, 12
C.P.R. Â§ 1005.10(b), require preauthorized EFTs from a consumerâs

account to be authonzed in writing.

fF3
~]

As described in paragraphs 48 to 51, im many instances Respondent
withdrew preauthorized EFTs from consumersâ accounts without a
valid authorization, including by withdrawing amounts that were
higher than authorized or withdrawing the same payment twice.

58. EFTA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693e(b), and its implementing Regulation E, 12
CFR. Â§ 1005.10(d), require a financial institution or designated
payee to provide a consumer with notice at least ten days in advance

of any automatic withdrawal that varies from the previous payment or

16
59.

60.

61.

62.

63.

from the preauthorized amount, unless the consumer has opted out of
the notice for a specified range of payment amounts.

Although consumers authorized preauthorized EFTs, many ofthe
withdrawals at issue varied from what consumers authorized,
Respondent failed to provide advance notice of the varying amounts,
and many consumers did not opt out of such notice. Other
withdrawals were duplicative of withdrawals Respondent had already
made, and thus not authorized.

Respondent therefore violated Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.10(b)
and (d).

Respondentâs LI'TA Violations are Violations ofthe CEPA
Section 1036(a)(1)(A) ofthe CFPA makes it unlawful for covered
persons, such as Respondent, to âcommit any act or omission in
violation ofa Federal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§
5536(ay1 A).

EFTA is a âFederal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C, Â§
5481 2\KC), 14).
By violating EFTA as described in paragraphs 55 to 60, Respondent

violated the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)C1 WA).

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Student Loan Servicers
Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation, and Discover Products, Inc. for
Violating a Bureau Consent Order and Other Unlawful Practices

DEC 22, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation, and Discover
Products, Inc. (collectively, Discover) based on the Bureau's findings that Discover violated a
prior Bureau order, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). Discover Bank, headquartered in Greenwood, Delaware, is
an insured depository institution that provides and services private student loans. The
Student Loan Corporation and Discover Products, Inc., are affiliates of Discover Bank, and
also engage in student loan servicing. Under todayâs order, Discover must pay at least $10
million in consumer redress and a $25 million civil money penalty.

The Bureau previously issued a consent order against Discover in July 2015 (2015 Order).
The Bureau's 2015 Order was based on the Bureau's finding that Discover misstated the
minimum amounts due on billing statements as well as tax information consumers needed
to get federal income tax benefits. The Bureau also found that Discover engaged in illegal
debt collection practices. The Bureauâs 2015 Order required Discover to refund $16 million
to consumers, pay a penalty, and fix its unlawful practices servicing and collection practices.
The Bureau found that Discover violated the 2015 Order's requirements in several ways.
Discover misrepresented the minimum loan payments consumers owed, the amount of
interest consumers paid, and other material information, such as interest rates, payments,
due dates, and the availability of rewards, among other things. Discover also did not
provide all of the consumer redress the 2015 Order required.

The Bureau found that Discover engaged in unfair acts and practices by withdrawing
payments from more than 17,000 consumersâ accounts without valid authorization and by
cancelling or not withdrawing payments for more than 14,000 consumers without notifying
them. This conduct violated the CFPA, EFTA, and Regulation E. The Bureau also found that
Discover engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by
misrepresenting to more than 100,000 consumers the minimum payment owed and to
more than 8,000 consumers the amount of interest paid. Some consumers ended up paying
more than they owed, others became late or delinquent because they could not pay the
overstated amount, while others may have filed inaccurate tax returns.

Todayâs order prohibits Discover from making any misrepresentations about minimum
payments consumers owe, the amount of interest consumers paid, and other material
servicing terms. The order also prohibits Discover from withdrawing loan payments from
consumersâ bank accounts in amounts or at times not authorized by consumers.

DMB Financial, LLC,

Case No. 1:20-cv-12147

Defendant.

 

 

COMPLAINT

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) brings this action against DMB

Financial, LLC (DMB) and alleges as follows.
INTRODUCTION

1. The Bureau brings this action under the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and
Abuse Prevention Act (Telemarketing Act), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6102(c), 6105(d); the Telemarketing
Sales Rule (TSR), 16 C.F.R. pt. 310; and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a), 5564, 5565, in connection with the marketing and sale of
debt-settlement or debt-relief services.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because it is brought
under âFederal consumer financial law,â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(a)(1), presents a federal question, 28
U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and is brought by an agency of the United States, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345.

3. Venue is proper because DMB is located or resides or does business in this district. 12

US.C. Â§ 5564(f).

PARTIES

4. The Bureau is an independent agency of the United States created by the CFPA.
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5491 (a). It has independent litigating authority and may secure appropriate relief for
violations of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(a)-(b), and the TSR, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6102(c), 6105(d).

5. DMB, a Massachusetts limited-liability company, maintains its principal place of
business at 500 Cummings Center, Suite 3800, Beverly, Massachusetts 01915.

6. DMB offers and provides âfinancial advisory services,â including debt-settlement
services, to consumers owing unsecured debts to creditors. Those activities are âconsumer
financial services or productsâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5)(A), (15)(A)(vii) UD). DMB
is therefore a âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6).

7. In connection with a campaign to make interstate phone calls to consumers and to
use advertisements to solicit calls from consumers to induce them to purchase its services,
wherein DMB offers to renegotiate, settle, or in any way alter the terms of payment or other
terms of the debt between a person and one or more unsecured creditors or debt collectors, DMB
initiates and receives telephone calls from consumers. Thus, DMB 1s a âtelemarketerâ offering a
âdebt relief serviceâ under the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(0), (ff).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

8. DMB is a debt-settlement company. Established in 2003, DMB claims that it has
successfully negotiated and settled consumer debts in excess of $1 billion for over 30,000
consumers who have enrolled in its debt-settlement programs.

9. DMBâs debt-settlement programs are advertised to consumers through DMBâs

website and direct-mail campaigns, which advertise a toll-free telephone number that consumers
could call to enroll in DMBâs programs, and by outside marketing companies through the use of
live-transfer companies or lead generators that direct consumers to DMB.

10. DMBâs employees have received phone calls from prospective customers and
have initiated phone calls to prospective customers in at least 24 states to persuade them to enroll
in its debt-settlement programs.

11. DMB has instructed consumers who had been making payments to their creditors
to withhold any further payments. Because DMB requires consumers to stop paying creditors, its
programs are likely to result in increased interest and fees after enrollment.

12. DMB has required consumers enrolled in its debt-settlement program to deposit
funds into dedicated accounts with an FDIC-insured account provider. DMB has claimed that
once there were sufficient funds in those accounts to make settlement offers to consumersâ
creditors, DMB would negotiate with the creditors to persuade them to accept less than the
individual debt amounts owed.

13. When an individual debt enrolled in its debt-settlement program was settled or a
creditor ceased attempts to collect the debt (in the absence of a settlement), DMB would charge
consumers fees.

The Financial Liberty Program and the Financial Independence Program

14. Since at least 2012, DMB has offered two debt-settlement programs: the Financial
Liberty Program (Liberty Program) and the Financial Independence Program (Independence
Program). The only difference between the programs is how DMB structures the fee charged to
consumers. Consumers enrolled in the Liberty Program pay DMB a settlement fee that is a

percentage of the consumerâs debt balance. Consumers enrolled in the Independence Program
â Â§ * ma, a oof of
: ry Reet ey PEN OTE PE
ard 4 Be EYES 2k FAY of eg
Lia! TAMAR AE AG Ae
teat

pay DMB a settlement fee that is a percentage of what consumers saved as a result of any debt
settlement that DMB secures for consumers.

15. To enroll in the Liberty Program, DMB required consumers to complete and sign
a Debt Settlement & Negotiation Services Agreement (the Liberty Enrollment Agreement) and a
Financial Program Questionnaire (the Liberty Questionnaire).

16. To enroll in the Independence Program, DMB required consumers to complete
and sign a Debt Settlement & Negotiation Services Agreement (the Independence Enrollment
Agreement) and a Financial Program Questionnaire (the Independence Questionnaire).

17. The Independence Enrollment Agreement and the Liberty Enrollment Agreement
state: âI understand that my commitment is essential for the success of this Program and
settlements will not be attempted until I have saved sufficient funds in my designated Savings
Account.â

18. The Independence Questionnaire and the Liberty Questionnaire require that
consumers initial the following statement: âYou agree to commit to the DMB Financial
[Liberty/Independence] Program, whereby our average Client negotiates and settles their
outstanding debts for approximately 50% of the total amount due at the time of settlement, in 36
months, with no prepayment penalties.â

DMBâs Method of Calculating Fees

19. Some versions of DMBâs Liberty Enrollment Agreement stated that the consumer
âagrees to pay the Company a fee in the amount of [__|% of the Enrolled Debt on each given
account negotiated and settled under the Program.â These agreements also described the âFee
Structureâ as a â[p]er settlement fee of | _]% of debt balance as determined at time of

enrollment.â
20. Some versions of DMBâs Independence Enrollment Agreement stated that the
consumer âagrees to pay the Company a fee in the amount of [| _]% of the Amount Saved by the
Company on each given account negotiated and settled under the Program (that is, the difference
between the creditorsâ claim amount (at the time of enrollment negotiations) and the agreed upon
Final Settlement Payment).â The Independence Enrollment Agreement also described the âFee
Structureâ as a â[p]er settlement fee of | _]% of savings off debt balance as determined at time
of enrollment.â

21. | Completed Liberty and Independence Enrollment Agreements included a Creditor
Summary Page, which listed, among other things, each debt enrolled in the program and the debt
balance at the time of enrollment.

22. Despite representations in these enrollment materials that DMBâs fee would be a
percentage of, or the savings off of, the enrolled debt, DMB charged enrolled consumers a fee
based on what DMB called the âVerified Debt.â

23. The Verified Debt amounts were often greater than the debt amounts listed on the
Creditor Summary Page.

24. Before 2019, DMB used the term âVerified Debt Amountâ to mean the amount of
debt verified by DMB based on a creditor statement submitted by the consumer, or when no
creditor statement was provided, the debt balance at the time DMB contacted the creditor to
negotiate a settlement.

25. Beginning in 2019, DMB began verifying debt amounts based on the amount
reported on the consumerâs consumer credit report, which was obtained at or near the time of

enrollment.
26. Until 2019, if DMB never received a creditor statement submitted by a consumer
for a particular debt, DMB calculated its settlement fee based on the debt amount after
enrollmentâoften the debt amount at the time of settlementâinstead of the debt amount at the
time of enrollment.

27. The debt amount after enrollment is often greater than the debt amount at the time
of enrollment because the debt continues to accrue interest and fees until a settlement is reached.
DMBâs Charging of Deceptive and Unlawful Fees

28. Since at least 2012, the Liberty and Independence Enrollment Agreements have
stated: âThe Client agrees to pay the Company a fee . . . on each given account negotiated and
settled under the Program. .. . Once Client receives an offer from any creditor enrolled in
program, accepts and makes first payment toward settlement, Company is entitled to receive its
full fee proportional to debt enrolled.â

29. In two scenarios, DMB charged consumers its fee contrary to the terms of its
enrollment agreements: (1) DMB charged some consumers its fee when DMB had not
successfully settled consumersâ debts; and (2) DMB charged some consumers its fee before
consumers had made a first payment toward settlement.

30. DMB requested or received fees from at least hundreds of consumers when a
creditor, in the absence of a binding settlement, stopped collecting from a consumer, sometimes
following a charge-off. In such circumstances, the consumer had not executed a settlement
agreement and had made no settlement payment to the creditor or any debt collector before DMB
charged its fee. These consumers could still be subject to collection efforts, including real or
threatened litigation, and their credit reports could continue to reflect an unpaid or delinquent

debt in the trade line for that creditor. DMB did not disclose to consumers that it would charge
its fee under these circumstances, and consumers did not agree when they enrolled in DMBâs
programs to pay fees in these circumstances.

31. | DMB requested or received fees from thousands of consumers even though the
consumers had not yet made at least one payment under a settlement agreement, debt-
management plan, or other valid contractual agreement. DMB did not disclose to consumers that
it would charge its fee in this circumstance, and consumers did not agree when they enrolled in
DMBâs programs to pay fees in this circumstance.

Count 1

DMBâs Violations of the TSR and the CFPA
(Charging Advance Fees)

32. The Bureau incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1
through 31 of this Complaint.

33. It is a violation of the TSR for any seller or telemarketer in connection with the
sale of any debt-relief service to request or receive payment of any fee or consideration for any
debt-relief service until and unless, in addition to other requirements, the customer has made at
least one payment under that settlement agreement, debt-management plan, or other valid
contractual agreement between the customer and the creditor or debt collector. 16 C.F.R.

Â§ 310.4(a)(5)()(B).

34. DMB has requested and received fees from consumers in connection with
enrolled debts even though consumers have not made any payments under a settlement
agreement, debt-management plan, or other valid contractual agreement between the consumers

and the creditor or debt collector.
35. DMBâs requesting or receiving payment of fees from consumers under the
circumstances described in paragraph 34 is an abusive act or practice in telemarketing that
violates the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5)G)(B).

36. In addition, DMBâs violation of the TSR is treated as a violation of a rule under
Â§ 1031 of the CFPA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6102(c). DMB therefore has also violated Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Count 2

DMBâs Violations of the TSR and the CFPA
(Charging Fees in Absence of a Settlement)

37. The Bureau incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1
through 31 of this Complaint.

38. It is a violation of the TSR for any seller or telemarketer in connection with the
sale of any debt-relief service to request or receive payment of any fee or consideration for any
debt-relief service until and unless: (1) the seller or telemarketer has renegotiated, settled,
reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of at least one debt under a settlement agreement, debt
management plan, or other such valid contractual agreement executed by the customer; (2) the
customer has made at least one payment under that settlement agreement, debt-management
plan, or other valid contractual agreement between the customer and the creditor or debt
collector; and (3) where the debts are renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered
individually, the fee or consideration must be proportional to the debts that have been so settled,
or else charged at a flat percentage of the amount saved as a result of such settlements. 16 C.F.R.
Â§ 310.4(a)(5)().

39. DMB has requested and received fees from consumers in connection with

enrolled debts even though DMB had not renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered the
terms of these debts under a settlement agreement, debt-management plan, or other such valid
contractual agreement executed by the consumers, and consumers had not made any payments
under a settlement agreement, debt-management plan, or other valid contractual agreement
between the consumers and the creditor or debt collector.

AO. DMBâs requesting or receiving payment of fees from consumers under the
circumstances described in paragraph 39 is an abusive act or practice in telemarketing that
violates the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5)(i).

4]. DMBâs violation of the TSR is treated as a violation of a rule under Â§ 1031 of the
CFPA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6102(c). DMB therefore has also violated Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12
ULS.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Count 3

DMBâs Violations of the CFPA
(Deceptive Representations Regarding Chargeable Events)

42. The Bureau incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1
through 31 of this Complaint.

43. DMB has represented to consumers that it would not charge any fee for its
services until it settled a debt and consumers have made a settlement payment to the creditor. In
fact, DMB has charged consumers its fee in cases where it did not settle the consumerâs debt, the
consumer did not make a settlement payment, or both.

44. DMBâs representations regarding when it would charge or collect its fees from
consumers were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably. The circumstances in which
DMB charges consumers fees are material terms. DMBâs charging of fees to consumers as
described in paragraph 43 is a deceptive act or practice that violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C.

Count 4
DMBâs Violations of the TSR and CFPA
(Charging Fees Based on Debt Amount after Enrollment)

45. The Bureau incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1
through 31 of this Complaint.

46. To the extent a seller or telemarketer renegotiates, settles, reduces, or otherwise
alters a consumerâs enrolled debts individually over time, the TSR prohibits the seller or
telemarketer from requesting or receiving any fee or consideration unless such fee or
consideration: (1) bears the same proportional relationship to the total fee for renegotiating,
settling, reducing, or altering the terms of the consumerâs entire debt balance as the individual
debt amount bears to the entire debt amount, with the individual debt amount and the entire debt
amount being those owed at the time the debt was enrolled in the service; or (2) is a percentage
of the amount saved as a result of the renegotiation, settlement, reduction, or alteration; the
percentage charged cannot change from one individual debt to another, and the amount saved is
the difference between the amount owed at the time the debt was enrolled in the service and the
amount actually paid to satisfy the debt. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5)()(C).

47. | DMB settles consumersâ debts individually over time and has requested or
received fees based on the debt amount after enrollment instead of the debt amount at the time of
enrollment such that the fee neither (1) bears the same proportional relationship to the total fee as
the enrolled debt amount bears to the entire debt amount at the time of enrollment; nor (2) is a

percentage of the amount saved when the amount saved ts the difference between the debt

amount at the time of enrollment and the settlement amount.

10
48. DMBâs practice of requesting or receiving settlement fees described in paragraph
47 constitutes an abusive act or practice in telemarketing that violates the TSR. 16 C.F.R.
Â§ 310.4(a)(S)G)(C).
49, DMBâs violation of the TSR is treated as a violation of a rule under Â§ 1031 of the
CFPA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6102(c). DMB therefore has also violated Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12
ULS.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

DMBâs Violations of the CFPA
(Deceptive Representations about Fee Structure)

50. The Bureau incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1
through 31 of this Complaint.

51. Until 2019, some of DMBâs contracts represented to consumers that DMB would
charge a fee based on either the amount of the âEnrolled Debtâ or the âdebt balance as
determined at the time of enrollment.â In fact, DMB charged consumers based on what DMB
called âVerified Debtâ amounts, which were determined after enrollment.

52. Accordingly, some of DMBâs contracts misrepresented to consumers the debt
amount that would be used to determine DMBâs fees for debt-relief services.

53. These representations were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under
the circumstances because they specified that the enrolled debt amount would be used to
determine DMBâs fee.

54. The fee that DMB charges to consumers and the debt amount on which the fee is
based are material.

55. DMBâs omissions and misrepresentations constitute deceptive acts or practices

that violate the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

DMBâs Violations of the TSR and the CFPA
(Failing to Disclose Amount of Time Necessary Before Settlement Offer Made)

56. The Bureau incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1
through 31 of this Complaint.

57. It is a violation of the TSR for any seller or telemarketer in connection with the
sale of any debt-relief service to fail to disclose truthfully, in a clear and conspicuous manner
before a customer consents to pay for those services, to the extent that the service may include a
settlement offer to any of the customerâs creditors or debt collectors, the time by which the debt-
relief-service provider will make a bona fide settlement offer to each of the creditors or debt
collectors. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(a)(1)(viii)(A).

58. DMB failed to disclose before enrollment in a clear and conspicuous manner the
time by which DMB would make a bona fide settlement offer to each of a consumerâs creditors
or debt collectors.

59. | DMBâs failure to disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner the time by which
DMB would make a bona fide settlement offer to each of a consumerâs creditors or debt
collectors is a deceptive act or practice in telemarketing that violates the TSR. 16 C.F.R.

Â§ 310.3(a)(1)(vili)(A).

60. DMBâs violation of the TSR is treated as a violation of a rule under Â§ 1031 of the

62. It is a violation of the TSR for any seller or telemarketer in connection with the
sale of any debt-relief service to fail to disclose truthfully, in a clear and conspicuous manner
before a customer consents to pay for those services, to the extent that the service may include a
settlement offer to any of the customerâs creditors or debt collectors, the amount of money or the
percentage of each outstanding debt that the customer must accumulate before the debt-relief-
service provider will make a bona fide settlement offer to each of the creditors or debt collectors.
16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(a)(1)(viit)(B).

63. | DMB failed to disclose before enrollment in a clear and conspicuous manner the
amount of money or the percentage of each outstanding debt that a consumer must accumulate
before DMB would make a bona fide settlement offer on the consumerâs behalf.

64. DMBâs failure to disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner before enrollment
the amount of money or the percentage of each outstanding debt that a consumer must
accumulate before DMB would make a bona fide settlement offer to each of the consumerâs
creditors or debt collectors is a deceptive act or practice in telemarketing that violates the TSR.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues DMB Financial, LLC for Allegedly
Violating the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Consumer Financial Protection Act

DEC 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
lawsuit against DMB Financial, LLC (DMB). The Bureau alleges that DMB violated the
Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA)
in connection with its debt-settlement and debt-relief services. DMB, which has its principal
place of business in Beverly, Massachusetts, offers to renegotiate, settle, or otherwise alter
the terms of unsecured debts owed by consumers to creditors or debt collectors. The
Bureauâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
seeks an injunction, as well as redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and
the imposition of civil money penalties.

The Bureau alleges that DMB engaged in abusive and deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the TSR. These allegedly unlawful activities include requesting and receiving
fees before it performed its promised services and before consumers started payments
under any debt settlement. The Bureau also alleges that, after settling individual debts,
DMB collected fees based on increased debt amounts after enrollment rather than the
amount of each debt at the time of enrollment.

The Bureau alleges that DMB failed to disclose to consumers before enrollment when it
would make a settlement offer to creditors or debt collectors. In addition, the Bureau
alleges that DMB did not disclose the amount of money or the percentage of each
outstanding debt the consumer had to accumulate before DMB would make a settlement
offer. The Bureau alleges that DMBâs alleged TSR violations also constitute violations of the
CFPA. The Bureau further alleges that DMB misrepresented to consumers that it would not
charge fees for its services until after it settled a debt and consumers made a payment
under the settlement. The Bureau also alleges that DMB misrepresented in its contracts the
debt amount that it would use to determine its fees.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in federal district court in the District of Massachusetts is
available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_dmb-financial-

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Files Lawsuit Against Driver Loan, LLC And
Its CEO

NOV 05, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
lawsuit against Driver Loan, LLC, and its Chief Executive Officer, Angelo Jose Sarjeant, for
allegedly engaging in deceptive acts or practices in taking deposits from and offering credit
to consumers. Driver Loan, based in Doral, Florida, offers short-term, high-interest loans to
consumers funded by deposits made by other consumers. The Bureau alleges that Driver
Loan and Sarjeant violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by
misrepresenting the risks associated with the deposit product it offered to consumers and
by misrepresenting the annual percentage rate (APR) for extensions of credit it offered to
other consumers.

The Bureauâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida, alleges that since 2017, Driver Loan purports to have offered short-term, high-
interest personal loans totaling over $30 million, typically to drivers who work with ride-
share companies. The loans range from $100 to $500 each and are repayable in 15 daily
installments. The Bureau alleges that Driver Loan deceptively markets its loans as having an
APR of 440% when the actual APRs are about 975%.

In 2020, Driver Loan began taking deposits from consumers to fund the loans it makes.
Driver Loan claims to guarantee a 15% annual percentage yield on consumersâ deposits. It
also claims to guarantee that consumersâ deposits are held at FDIC-insured institutions,
which would protect against the loss of insured deposits. Driver Loanâs website also
represents that a new consumer deposits funds with the company about every minute. The
Bureau alleges that Driver Loanâs representations are false, as many consumersâ funds were
not held in FDIC-insured accounts, the rate of return was not âguaranteed,â and other
consumers were not rushing to deposit their funds with Driver Loan. The Bureau also
alleges that most deposited funds are lent to borrowers at rates that violate Floridaâs
criminal-usury law, rendering the loans uncollectable and creating substantial risk that
Driver Loan would not be able to collect delinquent loans or meet its obligations to
consumers who sought to withdraw their deposited funds.

The Bureau seeks an injunction against Driver Loan and Sarjeant to stop their alleged
unlawful conduct, as well as damages, redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten
gains, and the imposition of civil money penalties.

The Bureau's complaint is not a finding or ruling that Driver Loan, LLC or Angelo Jose
Sarjeant has violated the law.

proceeding to enforce its rights to any payment or monetary judgment under this Order,

Respondent provides remittance transfers to consumers using its retail
branches and a network of agents across the United States.

As of October 28, 2013, the effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondent has been subject to the requirements of EFTA and the
Remittance Rule.

Respondent failed to adequately comply with many ofthe Remittance Ruleâs
requirements.

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.34(a) by
failing to honor cancellation requests and
failing to provide cancellation rights

Section 1005.34 of the Remittance Rule requires remittance transfer
providers to honor any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer
from the sender that is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes
after the sender makes payment, provided that the request enables the
provider to identify pertinent information about the transfer, andthe funds
have not been received by the designated recipient.

Section 1005.34(b) also requires remittance transfer providers to refund, at
no additional cost to the consumer, the total amount of funds provided by the
sender in connection with a remittance transfer, including any fees and, to

the extent not prohibited by law, taxes imposed in connection with the

asserted cancellation request.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least April 2019,
Respondent failed to honor consumersâ properly-asserted cancellation
requests, andto provide refunds as a result of those requests, unless the
consumer appeared in person at the originating branch or agent location to
cancel their remittancetransfers.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least April 2019,
Respondent also failed to provide the 30-minute cancellation window to
consumers, and failed to provide a refund as a result of a properly-asserted
cancellation request, in instances where the originating branch or agent
location closed less than 30 minutes after the consumer initiated the transfer.
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(a).

Respondent violated Â§Â§ 1005.33(g)(1) and (g)(2)
by failing to develop and maintain policies and procedures
for error resolution under the Remittance Rule

Section 1005.33(g)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance transfer
providers to develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are
designed to ensure compliance with the Ruleâs error resolution requirements.

any documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the
alleged error, and the providerâs findings.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least April 2019,
Respondentâs written policies and procedures did not reference the
requirements for complying with the error resolution requirements in the
Remittance Rule; did not set forth how Respondentâs employees and agents
should identify errors; did not define the types of records to be maintained;
and did not specify the length of time for which such records must be
maintained.

Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.33(g)(1) and (g)(2).

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) by failing
to investigate and make error determinations

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance transfer
provider, in response to a consumerâs properly-asserted error notice, to
investigate promptly and determine whether an error occurred, as defined
under section 1005.33(a)(1)(i)-(v).

Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, Respondent has failed to
investigate promptly and determine whether an error, as defined under the
Remittance Rule, occurred.

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.33(d) by failing
to provide written reports of its investigation findings

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires that, when a
consumer alleges that a remittance transfer provider committed an error, the
provider must promptly investigate the alleged error and provide the results
of its investigation to the sender within three business days after completing
its investigation. Ifthe provider determines that an error occurred as alleged
by the sender, the investigation results may be provided orally. 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.31(a)(4). However, ifthe investigation finds no error or finds an
error different from the one alleged, the provider must provide the sender
with a written explanation. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(d).

Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, Respondent has failed to
provide consumers with written reports of its investigation findings where
no error occurred, ora different error occurred than the one identified in the
senderâs notice of error.

Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(d).

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)
by failing to refund certain fees and taxes

available to designated recipients by the date identified in the receipts.
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(i1).

Respondent violated $$ 1005.31-36 by failing
to treat international bill pay services as remittance transfers

Section 1005.30(e)(1) of the Remittance Rule establishes that for a service to
qualify as a remittance transfer: (1) there must be an electronic transfer of
funds; (2) thetransfer must be requested by a sender in the United States; (3)
the transfer must be sent to a designated recipient; (4) it must be sent by a
remittance transfer provider.

Respondent offered an international bill payment service that permitted
consumers in the United States to transfer funds to a designated recipient
outside of the country, through the recipientâs account with a commercial
entity such as a utility.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule until September 2019,

Therefore, Respondent violated the disclosure requirements and failed to
provide the substantive rights in the Remittance Rule, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.3 1-

Respondent violated Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1) (ii) and 1005.31(b)(2)(i)
by issuing some prepayment disclosures and receipts that failed to
disclose the appropriate currency of the remittance transfer to be received
Section 1005.31 of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance transfer
provider to provide a sender with (1) a written prepayment disclosure with
information about the remittance transfer, and (2) a written receipt that
includes the information provided in the prepayment disclosure plus the
promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient,
and information regarding certain sender rights.
Section 1005.3 1(b)(1)(vii) describes the substantive disclosure requirements
for prepayment disclosures, and section 1005.3 1(b)(2)(i) describes the
requirements for receipts, including the requirementthat providers disclose
to a sender âthe amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in
the currency in which the funds will be receivedâ in prepayment disclosures
and receipts.

Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, some of Respondentâs

which certain remittance transfers would be received, instead using the term
âNational Currency.â
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1 (vi) and
1005.31(b)(2)(i).
Respondent violated Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1) (ii) and
1005.31(b)(2) (i) by failing to use the term âtransfer feesâ
or a substantially similar term in some disclosures
Sections 1005.31(b)(1)(i1) and(b)(2)() of the Remittance Rule requires that
remittance transfer prepayment disclosures and receipts disclose to the
sender any fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the
currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term âTransfer
Feesâ or a substantially similar term.
Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, Respondentâs prepayment
disclosures andreceipts used theterms âTelex,â âOmission,â and
âHandling,â to describe the fees it charged to consumers.
âTelex,â âOmission,â and âHandlingâ are not substantially similar to
âTransfer Fees.â
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1 (1) and (b)(2)(1).

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Remittance Transfer Provider
for Remittance Transfer Rule Violations

DEC 21, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today

announced a settlement with Envios de Valores La Nacional (La Nacional) based on the
Bureauâs finding that La Nacional violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and the
Remittance Transfer Rule, which implements EFTA. La Nacional is a large remittance transfer
provider incorporated in New York and licensed in 15 states and the District of Columbia. La
Nacional sent $2.2 billion in remittance transfers between November 2016 and April 2018
from the United States to recipients in several countries in Central America, South America,
the Caribbean, and Africa. Remittance transfers allow consumers to send money abroad,
including to family members and friends. The order requires La Nacional to pay a $750,000
civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations. This is the fourth
action stemming from a Bureau sweep to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.

The Bureau found that, since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, La
Nacional has engaged in thousands of violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.
Specifically, the Bureau's investigation found that La Nacional violated EFTA and the
Remittance Transfer Rule by failing to honor cancellation requests and failing to refund
certain fees and taxes when funds were not available on time. The Bureau also found that La
Nacional has failed to maintain appropriate error resolution policies and procedures, to
adhere to error resolution requirements, and to provide consumers with reports of
investigation findings. The Bureau further found that La Nacional has failed to treat
international bill pay services as remittance transfers and to make proper disclosures in
numerous instances.

Under the terms of the consent order, in addition to paying a penalty, La Nacional must
adopt a compliance plan to ensure that its remittance transfer acts and practices comply
with all applicable Federal consumer financial laws and the consent order.

The consent order is available at:

COMPLAINT

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) brings this action against
FDATR, Inc., Dean Tucci, and Kenneth Wayne Halverson for (1) deceptive and abusive
telemarketing acts or practices that violate the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse
Prevention Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6101-6108, and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 16 C.F.R. Â§Â§
310.3, 310.4, and (2) deceptive acts or practices that violate Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536. The Bureau alleges as
follows.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because it concerns
federal consumer-financial law, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(a)(1), presents a federal question, 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1331, and is brought by an agency of the United States, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345.

2. Venue is proper in this district because Defendants are located, reside, or do

business in this district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).
PARTIES

3. The Bureau is an independent agency of the United States. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5491. The
Bureau is charged with enforcing âFederal consumer financial laws.â 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5564.
The Bureau has independent litigating authority, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5564(a)-(b), including the
authority to enforce the TSR with respect to the offering or provision of a consumer-financial
product or service under the CFPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6105(d).

4, FDATR, Inc. was a company incorporated in Illinois in 2014 that was
involuntarily dissolved on September 29, 2020. Its principal place of business was 199 South
Addison Road, Suite 104A, Wood Dale, Illinois. Through telemarketing and telephone sales,
FDATR offered and purported to provide student-loan debt-relief and credit-repair services to
consumers.

5. FDATR is subject to and liable for violations of the CFPA as a âcovered personâ
because it offered or provided a consumer-financial product or service, specifically âfinancial
advisory servicesâ in the form of debt-relief and credit-repair services, for use by consumers
primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5)(A), (6)(A),
(15)(A)(viii).

6. FDATR is also subject to and liable for violations of the TSR as (1) a
âtelemarketerâ because, in connection with telemarketing, it initiated and received telephone
calls from customers, and (2) a âsellerâ because, in connection with a telemarketing transaction,
it provided or offered to provide services to its customers in exchange for consideration. 16
C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(dd), (ff). FDATR engaged in âtelemarketingâ because it received inbound
telephone calls from consumersâcalls that consumers made in response to advertising placed by

or on behalf of FDATRâto induce those consumers to purchase its debt-relief and credit-repair
â

rs
the
th

services. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(gg). FDATR also provided âdebt relief servicesâ under the TSR
because it represented that it would alter the terms of payment for consumersâ student-loan debts.
16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(0).

7. Dean Tucci was an owner or officer of, or had managerial responsibility over,
FDATR. At all material times, Tucci managed, formulated, directed, designed, controlled or had
the authority to control, and materially participated in the conduct of FDATRâs affairs. He
developed FDATRâs advertising, sales scripts, and training materials, and he at times managed
FDATRâs day-to-day operations, including training sales people. In July 2017, Tucci transferred
FDATRâs ownership to Halverson for $0, but he continued to work for the company until 2019
as a âconsultantâ with managerial responsibility over, among other things, FDATRâs day-to-day
operations.

8. Tucci is subject to and liable for CFPA violations as a ârelated personâ and a
âcovered person.â A person is a ârelated personâ if he or she is a âdirector, officer, or employee
charged with managerial responsibility for... such covered personâ or a âshareholder,
consultant, joint venture partner, or other person... who materially participates in the conduct of
the affairs of such covered person.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(1), (it). Tucci is a ârelated personâ
because he was an officer of and had managerial responsibility for FDATRâhe was a key
decision maker, handled day-to-day operations, and was responsible for marketing and sales
practices. Tucci remained a ârelated personâ after he transferred ownership of FDATR to
Halverson in 2017 because he worked as a consultant for FDATR and materially participated in
its conduct and affairs. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)qai). As a ârelated person,â Tucci is deemed a

âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).
9, Tucci is also subject to and liable for violations of the TSR as a âsellerâ because

he arranged for FDATR to provide its services through telemarketing. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(dd). He
is also liable under the TSR for providing substantial assistance or support to FDATR because he
knew or consciously avoided knowing that it was engaged in acts or practices that violated Â§Â§
310.3(a) and 310.4 of the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b). He provided substantial assistance because
he drafted FDATRâs telemarketing sales scripts and designed FDATRâs program and marketing
materials. He knew or consciously avoided knowing that the representations being made about
the programâs success were false or had no reasonable basis and could not be substantiated.

10. Kenneth Wayne Halverson was an owner, officer, or manager of FDATR.
Halverson joined FDATR in 2016 as an officer and sales floor manager. He managed the
companyâs day-to-day operations and took control of the company when Tucci transferred
ownership to him in 2017. He purportedly closed the company in 2019.

11. Halverson is subject to and liable for CFPA violations as a ârelated personâ or
âcovered person.â A person is a ârelated personâ if he or she is a âdirector, officer, or employee
charged with managerial responsibility for... such covered personâ or a âshareholder,
consultant, joint venture partner, or other person... who materially participates in the conduct of
the affairs of such covered person.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(1), (11). Halverson is a ârelated
personâ because he was an officer of and had managerial responsibility for FDATRâhe handled
its day-to-day operations as well as its sales force and sales practices. As a related person,
Halverson is deemed a âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).

12. Halverson is also subject to and liable for violations of the TSR as a âsellerâ
because he arranged for FDATR to provide its debt-relief services through telemarketing. 16

C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(dd). He is also liable under the TSR for providing substantial assistance or

support to FDATR, because he knew or consciously avoided knowing that it was engaged in acts
or practices that violated Â§Â§ 310.3(a) and 310.4 of the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b). He provided
substantial assistance because he managed the companyâs sales floor and was involved in the
design of the companyâs program and marketing materials. He knew or consciously avoided
knowing that the representations being made about the programâs success were false or had no
reasonable basis and could not be substantiated.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
13. | FDATR offered and provided student-loan debt-relief and credit-repair services to
consumers nationwide from 2011 until at least April 2019.
14. FDATR solicited consumers through radio and television commercials as well as
through its website, fedslrelief.com, and through Facebook ads that linked to the website.
15. On both the website and in Facebook advertisements, FDATR claimed that its
services would:
e Reduce or Eliminate Your Payments;
e Stop Wage Garnishment;
e Lift IRS Tax Liens; and
e Improve Credit Scores.
16. On its website, FDATR additionally claimed that 1t would:
e Cut Loan Payments in HALF;
e Restore Financial Aid Eligibility;
e Remove I9 Rating; and

e Restore your ability to get your Diplomas & Transcripts.
17. FDATRâs advertisements instructed consumers to call a toll-free number, which

connected consumers to FDATRâs telemarketing call center.

18. Through telemarketing-sales agents, FDATR told consumers that the company
had helped thousands of customers resolve their loan-payment problems.

19. FDATR, through its telemarketing-sales agents, told consumers that its services
would result in lower student-loan payments or in consumersâ student loans being forgiven and
that, with respect to those student loans, consumers would be debt-free, owing $0 in payments.

20. For consumers facing wage garnishment due to a student-loan debt, FDATR,
through its telemarketing-sales agents, offered services to resolve the consumerâs wage
garnishment.

21. For consumers that enrolled in services, FDATRâs telemarketing-sales agents
caused electronic documents, including a contract, a power-of-attorney form, and an invoice, to
be sent to the enrolling consumer through FDATRâs customer-management platform.

22. Before sending those documents to prospective customers, FDATR, through its
telemarketing-sales agents, charged the customer, typically $1 or $99, purportedly to ensure that
it had a valid payment method on file.

23. For its services, FDATR typically charged customers a minimum of $499 as a
one-time payment within two to three weeks of enrollment or $600 paid in installments over a
three-to-six-month period, with customers typically making the first payment within days or
weeks of enrollment.

24. The services that FDATR typically provided to customers consisted of, at most,
completing and filing loan-consolidation paperwork with the Department of Education, and it

typically took three to six months to do so.
Case: 1:20-cv-00879 Document #: J gd: 22/20/20 Page 7 of 15 Pagelb a?
25. But loan consolidation alone does not achieve the results that FDATR promised to

consumersâit does not necessarily result in lower loan payments, does not eliminate payments,
and can result in higher payments. Moreover, loan consolidation does not improve consumersâ
credit scores or remove negative credit-status codes or ratings from credit reports.

26. | FDATR had no basis to assert that its services would result in lower monthly
payments, cut student-loan payments in half, or eliminate consumerâs monthly student-loan
payments entirely. FDATR did not track whether its services achieved any of these results for
consumers. And consumers complained that FDATR did not, in fact, achieve these results.

27. FDATR had no basis to assert that its services would result in improved credit
scores or the removal of negative credit-status codes or ratings from credit reports. In fact,
FDATR did no work to improve consumersâ credit scores or to remove negative credit-status
codes or ratings from credit reports. And FDATR did not track whether its services achieved
these promised results. FDATR did not check consumersâ credit scores before or after the
company performed services for consumers and had no way of knowing how, or to what extent,
even a successful loan consolidation would impact a consumerâs credit score.

COUNT I
Abusive Telemarketing Acts or Practices That Violate the TSRâDebt-Relief Services
(Against All Defendants)

28. The allegations in paragraphs | to 27 are incorporated here by reference.

29. It is an abusive telemarketing act or practice and a TSR violation for any seller or
telemarketer to request or receive payment of any fee or consideration for any debt-relief service
until and unless:

a. the seller or telemarketer has renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise

altered the terms of at least one debt pursuant to a settlement agreement,

the
th

debt-management plan, or other such valid contractual agreement
executed by the customer;

b. the customer has made at least one payment pursuant to that settlement
agreement, debt-management plan, or other valid contractual agreement
between the customer and the creditor or debt collector; and

C. to the extent that debts enrolled in a service are renegotiated, settled,
reduced, or otherwise altered individually, the fee or consideration either
(1) bears the same proportional relationship to the total fee for
renegotiating, settling, reducing, or altering the terms of the entire debt
balance as the individual debt amount bears to the entire debt amount; or
(2) is a percentage of the amount saved as a result of the renegotiation,
settlement, reduction, or alteration. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5)(1).

30. In numerous instances, in connection with telemarketing student-loan debt-relief
services, Defendants requested and received payment of a fee or consideration for a debt-relief
service before they renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of at least one
debt pursuant to a settlement agreement, debt-management plan, or other such valid contractual
agreement executed by the customer and the customer made at least one payment pursuant to
that agreement. And FDATRâs fee or consideration was not proportional to or a percentage of
the amount saved as a result of its services. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5)(i).

31. Defendants, therefore, engaged in abusive telemarketing acts or practices that

violated the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5)().
32. In addition to being sellers under the TSR, Tucci and Halverson also provided

substantial assistance or support to FDATR while they knew or consciously avoided knowing
that FDATR had engaged in an act or practice that violated the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b).
COUNT II
Abusive Telemarketing Acts or Practices That Violate the TSRâCredit-Repair Services
(Against All Defendants)

33. The allegations in paragraphs | to 27 are incorporated here by reference.

34. It is an abusive telemarketing act or practice and TSR violation for any seller or
telemarketer to request or receive payment of any fee or consideration for goods or services
represented to remove derogatory information from, or improve, a personâs credit history, credit
record, or credit rating, until:

a. the timeframe in which the seller has represented that all of the goods or
services will be provided to that person has expired; and

b. the seller has provided the person with documentation in the form of a
consumer report from a consumer-reporting agency demonstrating that the
promised results have been achieved, such report having been issued more
than six months after the results were achieved. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(2).

35. Defendants made representations to consumers that its services would remove
derogatory information from, or improve, consumersâ credit histories, credit reports, or credit
ratings, but Defendants did not provide any such services.

36. Defendants routinely requested and received payment of a fee or consideration for
its credit-repair services before (a) the timeframe in which they represented that all of their goods
or services would be provided to the consumer expired, and (b) they provided the consumer with

documentation in the form of a consumer report from a consumer-reporting agency
demonstrating that the promised results were achieved, such report having been issued more than
six months after the results were achieved.

37. Defendants, therefore, engaged in abusive telemarketing acts or practices that
violated the TSR, 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(2).

38. In addition to being sellers under the TSR, Tucci and Halverson also provided
substantial assistance or support to FDATR while they knew or consciously avoided knowing
that FDATR had engaged in an act or practice that violated the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b).

COUNT I
Deceptive Telemarketing Acts or Practices That Violate the TSR
(Against All Defendants)

39. The allegations in paragraphs | to 27 are incorporated here by reference.

AO. It is a deceptive telemarketing act or practice under the TSR for a seller or
telemarketer to misrepresent any material aspect of the performance, efficacy, nature, or central
characteristics of its services. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(a)(2)ai1).

Al. It is also a deceptive marketing practice under the TSR for a seller or telemarketer
of a debt-relief service to misrepresent any material aspect of any debt-relief service, including:
(1) the percentage of the debt amount that a customer may save through the service, (2) the effect
of the service on collection efforts of the customerâs creditors or debt collectors, and (3) the
effect of the service on a customerâs creditworthiness. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(a)(2)(x). And, when
making representations, a seller or telemarketer must have a reasonable basis to substantiate its
claims. Telemarketing Sales Rule, Statement of Basis and Purpose, 75 Fed. Reg. 48,458, 48,500-
501 (Aug. 10, 2010).

42. In numerous instances, in connection with telemarketing their services,

Defendants misrepresented, directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, material aspects of

10
the student-loan debt-relief services that they offered, sold, or provided to consumers, including

that its services would result in:

a. reduced student-loan payments or cut student-loan payments in half;

b. eliminated student-loan payments;

C. improved credit scores; and

d. the removal of negative credit-status codes or ratings from credit reports.
43. But, in numerous instances, FDATRâs actions did not result in the elimination of

consumersâ student-loan payments, did not cut consumersâ student-loan payments, did not
always reduce consumersâ student-loan payments, did not improve consumersâ credit scores, and
did not remove negative credit-status codes or ratings from consumersâ credit reports. Further,
FDATR did not provide any services related to credit reporting or scores and in no way tracked
whether it achieved the results advertised.

44. Accordingly, these claims were falseâFDATR rarely if ever achieved the
promised results and, in some instances, did not provide the promised services at all.

45. These claims were also unsubstantiatedâFDATR cannot substantiate these
claims because it did not track its results and it had no way of knowing whether it achieved the
promised results.

46. Defendants, therefore, engaged in deceptive telemarketing acts or practices that
violated the TSR, 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(a)(2)(ii1) and (x).

A7. In addition to being sellers under the TSR, Tucci and Halverson also provided
substantial assistance or support to FDATR while they knew or consciously avoided knowing

that FDATR had engaged in an act or practice that violated the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b).

11
COUNT IV
TSR Violations Constitute Violations of the CFPA
(Against All Defendants)

48. The allegations in paragraphs | to 27 are incorporated here by reference.

49, Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
commit any act or omission that violates a âFederal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§
5536(a)(1)(A).

50. A violation of the TSR that is committed by a person subject to the CFPA shall be
treated as a violation of a rule under Â§ 1031 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531, regarding unfair,
deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6102(c)(2).

51. Therefore, a violation of the TSR by a covered person is also a violation of the
CFPA.

52. Because Defendants are covered persons and have committed an act or omission
that violated the TSR, they also violated the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

COUNT V
Deceptive Acts or Practices That Violate the CFPA
(Against All Defendants)

53. The allegations in paragraphs | to 27 are incorporated here by reference.

54. Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a
consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer-financial product or service.
12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

55. An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or

omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

12
56. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or provision of student-
loan debt-relief and credit-repair services, Defendants represented, directly or indirectly,

expressly or by implication, to consumers that its services would result in:

a. reduced student-loan payments or cut student-loan payments in half;

b. eliminated student-loan payments;

C. improved credit scores; and

d. the removal of negative credit-status codes or ratings from credit reports.
57. These claims were material because they were the main services that FDATR

offeredâdebt relief and credit repairâand were the outcomes that financially distressed
consumers paid FDATR to pursue. Moreover, these claims were likely to affect consumersâ
decisions to enroll in FDATRâs program and pay FDATR for its services.

58. These claims were falseâFDATR rarely if ever achieved the promised results
and, in some instances, did not provide the promised services at all.

59, These claims were also unsubstantiatedâFDATR cannot substantiate these
claims because it did not track its results and it had no way of knowing whether it achieved the
promised results.

60. Consumers reasonably relied on FDATRâs express claims about the results its
services would achieve, and these claims misled financially distressed consumers into paying
substantial amounts of money to FDATR to their detriment.

6l. Defendants, therefore, engaged in deceptive acts or practices that violated the

CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1).

DEMAND FOR RELIEF

As permitted by 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565, the Bureau requests that the Court:

a. permanently enjoin Defendants from further violations of the TSR and CFPA;

e. impose civil money penalties against Defendants; and

as the Court may determine to be just and proper.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Debt Settlement Company FDATR,
Inc., and Owners Dean Tucci and Kenneth Wayne Halverson

NOV 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
lawsuit against FDATR, Inc., and its owners, Dean Tucci and Kenneth Wayne Halverson. The
Bureau alleges that FDATR, Tucci, and Halverson violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule
(TSR) by engaging in deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices and the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) through deceptive acts or practices.
FDATR was a corporation headquartered in Wood Dale, Illinois, that promised to provide
student-loan debt-relief and credit-repair services to consumers nationwide. Tucci and
Halverson both owned and managed FDATR, which was involuntarily dissolved in
September 2020. The Bureau's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, seeks injunctions against FDATR, Tucci, and Halverson, as well as
damages, redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of
civil money penalties.

The Bureau specifically alleges that from 2011 through at least April 2019, the defendants
engaged in abusive telemarketing by requesting and taking payments from consumers for
debt-relief and credit-repair services before achieving the results it promised and before it
was legally allowed to do so under the TSR. The Bureau also alleges that during this same
period, the defendants used deception in violation of the TSR and CFPA to attract
consumers by misrepresenting material aspects of its student-loan debt-relief services. For
example, the defendants falsely represented that its services would reduce or eliminate
student-loan payments and improve credit scores. The Bureau further alleges that
defendantsâ violations of the TSR constituted violations of the CFPA. In addition, the Bureau
alleges that Tucci and Halverson are individually liable under the TSR and CFPA because
they knew of, directed, and engaged in the violations described in the complaint and
substantially assisted FDATR.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois is

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS
EASTERN DIVISION

Bureau of Consumer Financial
Protection,

Case No.

Plaintiff,

Fifth Third Bank, National Association,

Me NY NY NYY NYY Ne NYY Ne SNe SSS

Defendant.

COMPLAINT
The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) files this Complaint

against Fifth Third Bank, National Association (Fifth Third) and alleges as follows.

Introduction

1. Fifth Third offers and provides to consumers an array of financial
products and services.

2. For years, and continuing through at least 2016, Fifth Third used a
âcross-sellâ strategy to increase the total number of products and services it provided
to existing customers.

3. To further this cross-sell strategy, and to increase the number of

products and services it provided to existing customers, Fifth Third conditioned

1
employee-performance ratings and, in some instances, continued employment on
whether managers and their subordinate employees met ambitious sales goals. Fifth
Third also used an incentive-compensation program that rewarded managers and their
subordinate employees for selling new products and services to existing customers.

4. Reasonable sales goals and performance incentives are not inherently
harmful. But when such programs are not carefully and properly implemented and
monitored, they may create incentives for employees to engage 1n misconduct in order
to meet goals or earn additional compensation.

5. Despite knowing since at least 2008 that employees were opening
unauthorized consumert-financial products and services, Fifth Third took insufficient
steps to properly implement and monitor its program, detect and stop misconduct,
and identify and remediate harmed consumers. Predictably, Fifth Thirdâs employees,
without consumersâ knowledge or consent, opened deposit accounts in consumersâ
names; transferred funds from consumersâ existing accounts to new, improperly
opened accounts; issued credit cards; enrolled consumers in online-banking services;
and opened lines of credit on consumersâ accounts. In short, Fifth Third focused on
its own financial interests to the detriment of consumers.

6. Fifth Thirdâs conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of
2010 (CFPA), the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Truth in Savings Act (TISA), and

their implementing regulations.
7. The Bureau brings this action to stop Fifth Thirdâs unlawful conduct and
to obtain redress for affected consumers and an appropriate penalty and other
monetary relief.

8. The Bureau brings this action under Â§Â§ 1031, 1036(a)(1), 1054, and 1055
of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1), 5564, 5565; TILA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1601
et seq., and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. part 1026; and TISA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 4301 et seq., and its implementing regulation, Regulation DD, 12 C.F.R.

part 1030.

Jurisdiction
9. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because it 1s
brought under âFederal consumer financial law,â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(a)(1); presents a
federal question, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331; and is brought by an agency of the United States,

28 US.C. Â§ 1345.

Venue
10. Venue is proper in this district because Fifth Third 1s located, resides, or

does business in this district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).

Parties
11. The Bureau is an independent agency of the United States created by the

CFPA and charged with regulating the offering and providing of consumer-financtal

3
products and services under âFederal consumer financial laws.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5491 (a).
The Bureau is authorized to initiate civil actions in federal district court, by its own
attorneys, to address violations of âFederal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C.
Â§ 5564(a)-(b).

12. Fifth Third operates, among other things, a branch-banking business
that offers and provides an array of financial products and services primarily used by
consumers for personal, family, or household purposes. Fifth Third is therefore a

âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (6), (15)(A).

Factual Background

13. Fifth Third has more than $150 billion in total assets and, through its
branch-banking business, operates more than 1,100 full-service branches in Illinois,
Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and
West Virginia.

14. Among the products and services Fifth Third offers through its branch-
banking business are checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, online
banking, and lines of credit.

15. To increase sales of its products and services, from at least 2010 through
at least 2016, Fifth Third imposed sales goals on bank employees and implemented an
incentive-compensation program that financially rewarded employees for selling new

products and services. Sales goals were often set at a level higher than the anticipated

4
Case: 1:20-cv-01683 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/09/20 Page 5 of 17 PagelD #:5

sales for thousands of employees. Fifth Third used the achievement or non-
achievement of sales goals as a key component in performance ratings. Low
performance ratings could result tn disciplinary action, including termination.

16. By 2010, at the latest, Fifth Third was aware that employees were
opening products and services in consumersâ names without those consumersâ
knowledge or consent 1n order to achieve sales goals or obtain incentive rewards.

17. Despite Fifth Thirdâs knowledge of unauthorized consumer-financial
products and services, Fifth Third failed to take adequate steps to detect and stop

these acts or practices, and to identify, notify, and remediate harmed consumers.

Deposit Accounts

 

18. Fifth Third imposed aggressive sales goals for its employees to open new
deposit accounts, and its incentive-compensation program rewarded employees for
opening new deposit accounts funded with a specified minimum balance within a
defined period.

19. From at least 2010 through at least 2016, Fifth Third opened deposit
accounts for existing Fifth Third customers without the customersâ knowledge or
consent.

20. Some of these unauthorized accounts were âfundedâ when a banker
transferred funds to the unauthorized account from the same consumerâs authorized

account without the consumerâs knowledge or consent. Often, once an unauthorized

5
Case: 1:20-cv-01683 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/09/20 Page 6 of 17 PagelD #:6

account was âfunded,â such that it qualified under the sales-goal tracking or incentive
program, the banker transferred the funds back to the consumerâs authorized account,
again without the consumerâs knowledge or consent.

21. Opening deposit accounts without consumersâ knowledge or consent
and moving consumersâ funds without their knowledge or consent exposed
consumers to risks of harm, including that they would be unable to meet their
financial obligations, would incur fees, or would experience negative effects on their
consumer-reportine-agency information.

22. Fifth Third charged unjustified fees to many consumers who had deposit
accounts opened without their knowledge or consent and whose funds were

transferred from their existing accounts to their new, improperly opened accounts.

Credit Cards
23. Fifth Third imposed aggressive sales goals for its employees to sell credit
cards to consumers, and its incentive-compensation program rewarded employees for
selling new credit cards.
24. From at least 2008 through at least 2016, Fifth Third issued credit cards
to existing customers without their knowledge or consent.
25. By 2009, at the latest, Fifth Third noticed a spike in unauthorized credit

cards being issued to consumers.
Case: 1:20-cv-01683 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/09/20 Page 7 of 17 PagelD #:7

26. Despite recognizing the increasing number of unauthorized credit cards,
Fifth Third continued to emphasize sales and to maintain credit-card sales goals and
incentive compensation.

27. Issuing credit cards without consumersâ knowledge or consent exposed
consumers to risks of harm, including unjustified fees for the unauthorized credit
cards and negative effects on their consumer-reporting-agency information. Fifth

Third charged many of these consumers unjustified fees.

Enrollment in Online Banking

 

28. Fifth Third imposed ageresstive sales goals for tts employees to enroll
consumers in its online-banking services, and its incentive-compensation program
rewarded employees for enrolling consumers 1n those services.

29. From at least 2010 through at least 2016, Fifth Third enrolled consumers
in online-banking services without their knowledge or consent.

30. Fifth Thirdâs enrollment of consumers tn online-banking services
without their knowledge or consent exposed consumers to the risk of harm, including

increased risk of data theft, money theft, and improper personal-data use.

Opening of Early Access
31. Early Access 1s a fee-based line of credit that allows Fifth Thirdâs

deposit-account holders to withdraw funds from their deposit accounts before the

funds have been deposited in the accounts. Fifth Third imposed aggressive sales goals
for its employees to sell Early Access to consumers, and its incenttve-compensation
program rewarded employees for enrolling consumers in âfee-based products,â
including Early Access.

32. Fifth Third opened Early Access lines of credit on consumersâ deposit
accounts without their knowledge or consent. Fifth Third was aware of this by June
2010, when senior management was notified of an increase in the number of calls by
employees to the internal whistleblower hotline regarding the unauthorized opening
of Early Access lines of credit.

33. Fifth Third opened unauthorized Early Access lines of credit from at
least 2010 through 2014, and Fifth Third retained unauthorized Early Access lines of
credit even after it stopped offering new Early Access lines of credit.

34. Fifth Thirdâs opening and retention of these unauthorized lines of credit

risked harm to consumers, including to thetr consumer-reporting-agency information.

Violations of Law
35. Fifth Thirdâs conduct, described above, violated and, where uncorrected,

continues to violate the CFPA, TILA, TISA, and their implementing regulations.
The CFPA

36. The CFPA prohibits âunfairâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is unfair if 1t causes or 1s likely to cause consumers substantial injury
that is not reasonably avoidable and 1s not outweighed by countervailing benefits to
consumers or to competition. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531(c)(1).

37. The CFPA prohibits âabusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C.
Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B). An act or practice is abusive if it materially interferes with a
consumerâs ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer-financial product
or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531(d)(1).

38. Additionally, an act or practice is abusive if it takes unreasonable

advantage of a consumerâs inability to protect his or her interests in selecting or using

a consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531(d)(2)(B).

Count I
Unauthorized Deposit Accounts
(Unfaitness, in Violation of the CFPA)
39. The Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.
40. Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of opening deposit accounts without
consumersâ knowledge or consent are likely to cause substantial injury in the form of
fees, penalties, and negative effects to consumer-reporting-agency information.

41. Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of transferring funds between consumersâ

accounts without their knowledge or consent are likely to cause substantial injury in

9
the form of fees, penalties, the inability to withdraw funds, and negative effects to
consumer-reportine-agency information.

42. Because these acts or practices occur without consumersâ knowledge, the
injuries are not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and they are also not outweighed
by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.

43. Therefore, Fifth Third engaged in unfair acts or practices that violate
Â§Â§ 1031(c)(1) and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c)(1), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Count II
Unauthorized Credit Cards
(Untfattness, in Violation of the CFPA)

44. The Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.

45. Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of issuing credit cards to consumers
without their knowledge or consent 1s likely to result in fees to consumers that the
consumers cannot reasonably avoid because they are not aware that the credit cards
have been issued.

46. Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of issuing credit cards to consumers
without their knowledge or consent 1s likely to result in harm to consumer-reporting-
agency information that the consumers cannot reasonably avoid because they are not
aware that the credit cards have been issued.

47. These injuries to consumers are not outweighed by countervailing

benefits to consumets or to competition.

10
48. Therefore, Fifth Third engaged in unfair acts or practices that violate
Â§Â§ 1031(c)(1) and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c)(1), 5536(a)(1)(B).
Count III
Unauthorized Enrollment in Online Banking Services
(Abusiveness, in Violation of the CFPA)

49. The Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.

50. =â Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of enrolling consumers in online-banking
services without their knowledge or consent materially interferes with consumersâ
ability to understand the terms and conditions of online banking.

51.â Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of enrolling consumers in online-banking
services without their knowledge or consent takes unreasonable advantage of the
inability of consumers to protect their interests in selecting or using a consumer-
financial product or service.

52. Therefore, Fifth Third engaged in abusive acts or practices that violate

Â§Â§ 1031(d)(1), 1031(d)(2)(B), and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(d)(1),

5531(d)(2)(B), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Count IV
Unauthorized Opening of Early Access
(Abusiveness, in Violation of the CFPA)

53. The Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.

54.â Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of opening Early Access lines of credit on
consumersâ deposit accounts without their knowledge or consent matertally interferes
with consumersâ ability to understand Early Accessâs terms and conditions.

55. Fifth Thirdâs acts or practices of opening Early Access lines of credit on
consumersâ deposit accounts without their knowledge or consent takes unreasonable
advantage of consumersâ inability to protect their interests in selecting or using a
consumer-financial product or service.

56. Therefore, Fifth Third engaged in abusive acts or practices that violate

Â§Â§ 1031(d)(1), 1031(d)(2)(B), and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(d)(1),

5531(d)(2)(B), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Count V
Unauthorized Credit Catd Issuance
(Violations of TILA and Regulation Z)
57. âThe Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.
58. Under TILA, âno credit card shall be issued except in response to a
request or application therefor.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1642. Regulation Z requires that

âregardless of the purpose for which a credit card 1s to be used, including business,

commercial, or agricultural use, no credit card shall be issued to any person except in

12
response to an oral or written request or application for the card; or as a renewal of,
or substitute for, an accepted credit card.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.12(a).

59. Fifth Third issued credit cards to consumers without their knowledge or
consent and not in response to an oral or written request or application for the card.

60. âTherefore, Fifth Third violated TILA and Regulation Z.

Count VI
Unauthorized Deposit Accounts
(Violations of TISA and Regulation DD)

61. The Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.

62.  âTISAâs purpose is âto require the clear and uniform disclosure ofâ
(1) the rates of interest which are payable on deposit accounts by depository
institutions; and (2) the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts, so that
consumers can make a meaningful comparison between the competing claims of
depository institutions with regard to deposit accounts.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 4301(b). TISA
further authorizes the Bureau to issue implementing regulations, including regulations
to carry out these purposes. E.g., 12 U.S.C. Â§ 4308(a).

63.  âTISAâs implementing regulation, 12 C-F.R. Â§ 1030.4 (Regulation DD),
requires the disclosure of the annual percentage yield and interest rate, compounding

and crediting information, balance information, fees, and more. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1030.4(b).

Those disclosures must be made before account opening. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1030.4(a)(1)(@).

13
64. By opening deposit-accounts without consumer authorization and, in
the process, failing to make the required disclosures to the affected consumers, Fifth

Third violated TISA and Regulation DD.

Count VII
Sales Practices Likely to Cause Unauthorized Accounts
(Unfatrness, in Violation of the CFPA)

65. The Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.

66. Even after learning of unauthorized Fifth Third consumer-financial
products and services by 2008, Fifth Third failed to change its sales practices to avoid
consumer harm. Instead, Fifth Third continued to foster sales practices that were
likely to cause unauthorized products and services.

67. Fifth Third imposed sales goals on all levels of branch employees as part
of its efforts to cross-sell; set goals that thousands of its employees could not achieve;
threatened employees with termination or other disciplinary action if they failed to
meet their goals; established a system under which managers pressured subordinate
employees to sell; failed to take steps to determine and address a root cause of
unauthorized accounts, which was consistently said by employees to be intense sales-
pressure; failed to close known loopholes in its collection of proof of consumer

authorization, thereby making it easy for employees to open accounts without valid

signature cards for deposit accounts or applications for credit products; and failed to

14
take reasonable steps to identify, notify, and remediate identifiable consumers
victimized by unauthorized account-openings.

68. Fifth Thirdâs sales practices were likely to cause substantial injury to
consumers, including adverse effects on their consumer-reporting-agency
information, the imposition of unjustified fees, the theft of funds or private
information, and the tnability to meet financial obligations. This substantial injury to
consumers is a predictable consequence of Fifth Thirdâs sales practices.

69. Because any unauthorized products or services and Fifth Thirdâs
conduct, including its failures to detect, notify, and remediate, occurred without
consumersâ knowledge, the substantial injury to consumers is not reasonably
avoidable by consumers.

70. Further, the substantial injury to consumers is not outweighed by
countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.

71. Therefore, Fifth Third engaged in unfair acts or practices that violate
Â§Â§ 1031(c) and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Additional Violations of the CFPA
72. âThe Bureau realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-38.
73. By violating TILA, Regulation Z, TISA, and Regulation DD, Fifth Third

violated Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Demand for Relief
The Bureau requests that the Court:
a. permanently enjoin Fifth Third from, without the consumerâs consent:

(1) opening any deposit account; (2) issuing any credit card; 3) enrolling the
consumer in online-banking services; and (4) opening any line of credit;

b. order Fifth Third to take all reasonable steps to identify and notify
consumers who may have had a consumet-financtal product or service opened
without their consent, and allow those consumers to have their products or services
closed without fees or penalties;

C. order Fifth Third to correct harmful consumet-reporting-agency
information, including but not limited to correction of any harmful trade lines on
consumer-credit reports resulting from unauthorized consumer-financial accounts and
services at Fifth Third;

d. order Fifth Third to pay damages, restitution, and other monetary relief
to consumers;

e. order Fifth Third to pay disgorgement or compensation for unjust
enrichment;

f. impose on Fifth Third a ctvil money penalty under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c);

Â©. order Fifth Third to pay the costs incurred tn connection with

prosecuting this action, under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(b); and

CONSENT ORDER

Go Direct Lenders, Inc.

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
direct-mail mortgage advertising activities of Go Direct Lenders, Inc. (Go Direct or
Respondent, as defined below) and identified violations of Â§ 1026.24 of Regulation
Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24, the implementing regulation of the Truth in Lending Act
(TILA), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1601â1667f; Â§ 1014.3 of the Mortgage Acts and Practicesâ
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule or Regulation N), 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3; and Â§Â§ 1031
and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5531, 5536. Under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 8Â§ 5563, 5565, the

Bureau issues this Consent Order.
Overview
Go Direct is a mortgage lender that offers and provides mortgages
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Go Direct advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
From March 2017 to April 2019, Go Direct sent consumers over 700,000
advertisements that violate federal law because of misleading and deceptive
statements and inadequate disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop Go Direct from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

V.
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

Go Direct is a California corporation with its principal place of business in
Sherman Oaks, California.

Go Direct is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in at least 11 states.
Go Direct is a âperson,â as defined in the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(19),
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(22), and the MAP Rule, 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.2, because it is a corporation.

During the Relevant Period, Go Direct has been a âcovered personâ under
the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A), because it is a person that engages in
offering and providing residential-mortgage loans, which are âconsumer

financial product[s] or service[s|â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (6),

(15)(A)Q@).
12.

13.

14.

15.

16.

17.

18.

During the Relevant Period, Go Direct has been subject to the MAP Rule
because it is a person over which the Federal Trade Commission has
jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 41-58.
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.1. The MAP Rule is a Federal consumer financial law. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 548114).

Go Direct provides âmortgage credit product|s],â as that term is defined in
the MAP Rule. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

Go Directâs mortgage advertisements are âcommercial communicationsâ
regarding a term of a âmortgage credit product,â as those terms are defined
in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

During the Relevant Period, Go Direct has offered âclosed-end creditâ in the
form of mortgage loans to âconsumers,â as those terms are defined in
Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10) & (11).

Go Directâs mortgage advertisements are advertisements for âclosed-end
credit,â as that term is defined in Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).
Go Direct offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by
the VA.

Go Directâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans

and servicemembers.
19.

20.

21.

22.

23.

24.

From March 2017 to April 2019, Go Direct mailed over 700,000 mortgage
advertisements to consumers in at least 11 states.
Go Direct ceased sending direct-mail advertisements upon receipt of the

Bureauâs Civil Investigative Demand dated April 16, 2019.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Go Direct was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Go Directâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and costs or fees
associated with the mortgage.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Go Direct represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those

credit terms.
25.

26.

27.

28.

29.

30.

In fact, Go Direct did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Go Direct misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, Go Direct was not actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
June 2018 advertised a mortgage with a fixed interest rate of 2.75% and an
APR of 2.885%. These advertisements stated in the fine print that this offer
was only available to borrowers with a credit score of 740 or higher.

But for borrowers with a credit score of 740 or higher, the actual APR for
this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z and taking into
consideration discount points required to obtain the advertised interest rate
and prepaid finance charges, was at least 3.162%.

These advertisements also stated in large font on the front page that the
2.75% interest rate and 2.885% APR were available to borrowers with
âFICO scores as low as 500.â But as indicated in the fine print, the

advertised interest rate and APR were not available to borrowers with a
31.

32.

33.

34.

35.

credit score below 740. The APR for this loan may have been even higher
than 3.162% for borrowers with FICO scores below 660.

Accordingly, Go Direct misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements misrepresented variable-rate
loans as âfixedâ rate loans.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
February 2019 used the word âfixedâ in bold font and capitalized letters next
to the advertised interest rate on the first page, but in fine print on the second
page, indicated that the advertised loan was, in fact, a variable-rate
mortgage.

In these advertisements, the phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-
Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not appear before the first use of the word
âfixed,â nor was it at least as conspicuous as any use of the word âfixedâ in
the advertisements.

In these advertisements, each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment was not accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the period for which the rate or payment would be
fixed and the fact that the rate may vary or the payment may increase after

that period.
36.

37.

38.

39.

40.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
November 2017 stated, without qualification or condition, that there was
âNo Application or Processing Feeâ for the advertised loan.

But the vast majority of consumers who obtained a loan from Go Direct paid
a processing fee, and virtually every consumer who purchased a VA loan
from Go Direct in the three-month period following this advertisement paid
a processing fee. Therefore, the statement âNo Application or Processing
Feeâ was false or misleading.

In another example, numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements included
the following blanket statement, or a very similar statement: âNo Appraisal,
No Assets, & No Income Documentation Needed.â While this statement is
generally true for Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan loans, it is not
true for VA cash-out refinance loans, which require appraisals, sufficient
assets, and income documentation. Go Direct rarely made this distinction to
qualify the blanket statement, even though the advertisements explicitly
offered cash-out refinance loans.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 27- 39

were likely to be misled by them.
41.

42.

43.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations
About an Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly
or by implication, through the use of formats and phrases, that Go Direct
was affiliated with the government or that the advertised product was
endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the government.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 28,000 consumers in
July 2018 were enclosed in envelopes that prominently displayed the year
2018 across the bottom with the â20â in white block letters and the â18â in
black box letters, a distinctive format used by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). The envelope stated that it was a âNotificationâ and that the contents
pertained to a âNOTICEâ about âVA BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY.â The
enclosed advertisement stated that it was an âELIGIBILITY ADVISORYâ
about âVA BENEFITSâ in a banner across the top. It also included a boxed
headline that stated the contents were about a â2018 â VA Policy Change
Advisory.â And in the text that followed, it stated: âThe U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs offers you an Interest Rate Reduction based on your

mortgage payment history.â Although the enclosed advertisement stated in
44,

45.

46.

47.

48.

2020-BCFP-0008 Document1 Filed 08/21/2020 Page 12 of 49

fine print that âThis is an advertisement,â these statements and other
characteristics relating to the mailing strongly implied that the solicitations
originated from a lender affiliated with the VA or the IRS.

In fact, those representations were false because Go Direct was not affiliated
with the government.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 42-44
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False Representations About an Increase in Property Value

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements misrepresented that Go
Direct had ârecordsâ showing that the value of the consumerâs property had
increased over the past year by a specific percentage stated in the
advertisement, creating equity that they could cash out if they refinanced
with a Go Direct mortgage.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
June 2018 stated, âOur records indicate that the value of your property at
[recipientâs home address] has appreciated by 23% since last year.â
Between November 2017 and April 2019, Go Direct disseminated over

460,000 advertisements that contained this same representation, except that
49.

50.

SI.

2020-BCFP-0008 Document1 Filed 08/21/2020 Page 13 of 49

some of the advertisements stated that the value of the consumerâs property
had increased by 21% or 22%.

Despite claiming that it had ârecordsâ to support these representations, Go
Direct had no such records. Go Directâs representations regarding the
percentage increase in the value of the consumerâs property were also false.
Go Direct disseminated these advertisements to virtually every region of the
country. In doing so, its property-value-appreciation representations were
not tailored to any particular house, neighborhood, city, state, or region.
Instead, Go Direct represented the same appreciation percentage to everyone
who received an advertisement based on a given templateâalways 21%,
22%, or 23%, depending on the template used. But residential property
appreciation rates vary significantly depending on location. In light of such
large variations between cities, states, and regions, Go Direct misrepresented
the property appreciation rates for many consumers by using the same rate
for all consumers who received an advertisement based on one of the three
templates.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 47-49
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures

Many of Go Directâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of repayment
or simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z,
including Â§ 1026.24(d) and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific
disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did not include the
other disclosures that are required.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the
consumerâs repayment obligations over the full term of the loan. For
example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 34,000 consumers in May
2018 advertised a mortgage for a â15-year term in an amount up to
$453,100.â Although these advertisements stated the period of repayment,
they did not disclose the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements for a loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of interest, but
failed to state an accurate APR for the loan because the stated APR was not
correctly calculated under Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and

1026.22.
55.

56.

57.

58.

For example, Go Direct advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
about 30,000 consumers in February 2019 stated an introductory annual rate
of interest of 2.75% that applied to the first three years of the advertised loan
and an APR of 3.055%. In fact, the APR for the loans promoted in those
advertisements was at least 4.26%. The APR disclosed in the
advertisements did not comply with the accuracy standards set forth in 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2).

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z
Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 23-39,
numerous Go Direct advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.
Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the

four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
59.

60.

downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t|he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)(11).

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraph 53,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements set forth the period of
repayment, which is a triggering term under Â§ 1026.24(d)(1)(11), but failed to
state the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§

1026.24(d)(2)(i1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i), if a direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on
a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple
annual rate of interest will apply; and

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the
[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
61.

62.

$Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i) because, as described in Paragraphs 54
and 55, numerous Go Direct direct-mail mortgage advertisements for a loan
for which more than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate
of interest, but did not disclose an APR that was correctly calculated under

the accuracy standards set forth in Regulation Z.
Misleading Use of the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24()(1)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24()(1), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the
credit transaction in an advertisement for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will
increase, unless:

(1) In the case of an advertisement solely for one or more
variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ
and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the
rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period....
63.

64.

65.

66.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 32-
35, numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements for variable-rate

transactions used the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the credit
transaction and did not comply with the requirements of Â§ 1026.24(i)(1)(1).

VIOLATIONS OF THE MAP RULE (REGULATION N)
Misrepresentations About Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he annual
percentage rate, simple annual rate, periodic rate, or any other rateâ
applicable to a mortgage credit product. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a
misrepresentation is specifically prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(b) because, as described in Paragraphs 27-31,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations

about the APR applicable to a mortgage credit product.
Misrepresentations About Fees or Costs, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly

or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he existence,
67.

68.

69.

nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer associated with the
mortgage credit product, including but not limited to misrepresentations that
no fees are charged.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is
specifically prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(c) because, as described in Paragraphs 36-39,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the existence, nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer

associated with a mortgage credit product.
Misrepresentations Using the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(g)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(g), it is a violation for any person subject to the

or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t|he
variability of interest, payments, or other terms of the mortgage credit
product, including but not limited to misrepresentations using the word
âfixed.ââ Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(g) because, as described in Paragraphs 32-35,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the variability of interest, payments, or other terms of a mortgage by

using the word âfixedâ to describe a variable-rate mortgage credit product.
Misrepresentations About Government Affiliation, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(n)

is endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with any
government or other program, including but not limited
to through the use of formats, symbols, or logos that

resemble those of such entity, organization, or

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(q), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t|he
consumerâs ability or likelihood to obtain any mortgage credit product or
term.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(q) because, as described in Paragraphs 28, 30,

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.
77.

Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-41, Go Directâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific APRs, the variable or fixed
nature of rates or payments, processing fees, or the need for appraisals, when
in fact those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that
Go Direct was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Go Direct engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 42-46, Go Directâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that Go
Direct was affiliated with the government.

In fact, Go Direct was not affiliated with the government.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were material
because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers.
Therefore, Go Direct engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1 )(B).

Deceptive Representations About Consumersâ

Ability or Likelihood to Obtain the Advertised Mortgage or Credit Term

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 28, 30, and 39-41, Go
Directâs mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication,
that assets and income documentation were not required to obtain a cash-out
refinance mortgage or that the credit terms stated in the advertisements were
available to borrowers with âFICO scores as low as 500.â

In fact, assets and income documentation are required to obtain a cash-out

refinance mortgage and the credit terms stated in the advertisements

containing the phrase âFICO scores as low as 500â were not available to
borrowers with FICO scores as low as 500.

Go Directâs misrepresentations that assets and income documentation were
not required to obtain a cash-out refinance mortgage and that credit terms
stated in the advertisements were available to borrowers with âFICO scores
as low as 500â were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations that assets and income documentation were
not required to obtain a cash-out refinance mortgage and that credit terms
stated in the advertisements were available to borrowers with âFICO scores
as low as 500â were material because they were likely to affect the conduct
or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Go Direct engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About an Increase in Property Value

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 47-51, Go Directâs
mortgage advertisements claimed Go Direct had ârecordsâ indicating that
the value of the consumerâs property had increased over the past year by a
specific percentage stated in the advertisement.

In fact, Go Direct had no such records.

97.

98.

2020-BCFP-0008 Document1 Filed 08/21/2020 Page 25 of 49

In many instances, Go Directâs representations regarding the percentage
increase in the value of the consumerâs property were false.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about increases in the value of the
consumerâs property, and that it had records indicating that the value had
increased, were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about increases in the value of the
consumerâs property, and that it had records indicating that the value had
increased, were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Go Direct engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule

Under the CFPA, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules
thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).

Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.
99.

Go Directâs violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in
Paragraphs 8-73, constitute violations of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Third Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

AUG 21, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Go Direct Lenders, Inc. (Go Direct), a California corporation that is
licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 11 states. Go Direct offers and provides
mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Go
Direct's principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail
advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers and veterans. The
Bureau found that Go Direct sent consumers numerous mailers for VA-guaranteed
mortgages that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked
required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices -
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires Go Direct to pay
a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the third case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.

On July 24, 2020, the Bureau announced consent orders against Sovereign Lending Group,
Inc., and Prime Choice Funding, Inc., both California corporations, for similar violations. The
Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising
provides consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and
terms available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This
ongoing sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws
that ensure the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including
servicemembers, veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are
designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Go Direct disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, Go Direct advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including advertising a lower annual percentage rate than it was prepared
to offer. Go Direct also made misrepresentations about the applicable fees in connection
with the advertised mortgage. Go Direct advertisements misleadingly described variable-
rate loans as âfixedâ rate loans, when in fact the rate was adjustable and could increase over
time. Go Direct advertisements falsely stated or implied that an appraisal, assets, and
income documentation were not required to qualify for certain loans and that consumers
with FICO scores as low as 500 would qualify for the advertised rates.

The Bureau also found that Go Direct advertisements falsely represented that it had records
showing that the value of the consumer's property had increased over the past year by a
specific percentage. Go Direct advertisements created the false impression that Go Direct
was affiliated with the government by using words, phrases, images, or design
characteristics that are associated with the VA or the Internal Revenue Service. Further, Go
Direct advertisements failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit
terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the consumer's repayment obligations over the
full term of the loan.

The consent order against Go Direct requires Go Direct to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.
The consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including
requiring Go Direct to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising
compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with
mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those
identified by the Bureau; and requiring Go Direct to comply with certain enhanced
disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

rule, the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 16 C.F.R. Part 310. The Bureau alleged that
the Defendants engaged in abusive telemarketing practices in violation of the TSR by
requesting and receiving payment of unlawful advance fees from consumers seeking
debt-relief services for their private student loans.

Defendant Amanda Johanson was duly served on October 14, 2020 (ECF 40), but
she failed to file an answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint. The clerk entered
default against Defendant Johanson (Defaulting Defendant) on November 10, 2020. ECF
47. The Bureau has filed an Application for Entry of Default Judgment and Order for
Permanent Injunction, Monetary Relief, and Civil Money Penalties against Defaulting
Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2) and Local Rules 55-1 and 55-2. The
Court, having considered the Bureauâs application, supporting declarations and exhibits

and other evidence filed in this matter, finds good cause to grant the relief requested.
THEREFORE, it is HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as

 

follows:
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Â§ 5564 (f).
4. Defaulting Defendant was duly served with the Complaint and the summons

member of the military service.

email on December 7, 2020, at least seven days before any hearing on the Application.
The written notice included the amount of the money judgment requested, comprised of

9. The Bureauâs Complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted.

10. The allegations in the Complaint, except with respect to damages, are taken
as true because of Defaulting Defendantâs default.

11. Judgment is entered on behalf of the Bureau and against Defaulting
Defendant on Count I of the Complaint.

12. This Court is empowered to issue injunctive relief, monetary relief, and civil
money penalties pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565.

13. The Bureau is entitled to an Order imposing a permanent injunction against
Defaulting Defendant and requiring Defaulting Defendant to pay restitution in the

For a Telemarketed Debt-Relief Service (Count I)

16. Defaulting Defendant, having entered into engagement agreements with
consumers in connection with telemarketing to provide a debt-relief service purported to
reduce or eliminate those consumersâ private student-loan debts primarily through
negotiation, charged those consumers fees on a monthly basis starting at or just after

17.  Detfaulting Defendant, as a seller under the TSR, unlawfully requested and
received payment of fees for debt-relief services before the terms of at least one of the
consumerâs debts had been negotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered pursuant to
an agreement executed by the consumer; and the consumer had made at least one
payment pursuant to that agreement, in violation of the TSR. 16 C.F.R.

Â§ 310,.4(a)(5)G)(A)-(B).
Basis for Equitable and Monetary Relief

18. The Bureau is proceeding on behalf of thousands of financially distressed
individuals unlawfully charged millions of dollars for debt-relief services. Consumer Fin.
Prot. Bureau v. Siringoringo, No. SACV1401155JVSAJWX, 2016 WL 102435, at *6
(C.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2016). Considering the balance of hardships and the public interest, the
public interest is served by an injunction preventing Defaulting Defendant from engaging
in behavior related to her previous legal conduct. FTC v. Affordable Media, 179 F.3d
1228, 1236 (9th Cir. 1999). Defaulting Defendant was involved in an elaborate, illegal

scheme from its inception, in which she participated for three years, and therefore

 

broader âfencing-inâ relief provisions help to âprevent similar and related violations from
occurring in the future.â World Accounts, Inc. v. FTC, 594 F.2d 212, 215 (9th Cir. 1979).
Accordingly, the permanent injunction ordered in Sections I and II below constitutes
âappropriate ... equitable relief.â 12 U.S.C. $$ 5564(a), 5565(a).

19. Legal restitution is âmeasured by the loss to consumers.â FTC v. Inc21.com
Corp., 475 F. Appâx 106, 108 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v.
Gordon, 819 F.3d 1179, 1195 (9th Cir. 2016) (the appropriate measure for restitution is
the âfull amount lost by consumers rather than limiting damages to a defendantâs
profits.â) (quoting FTC v. Stefanchik, 559 F.3d 924, 931 (9th Cir. 2009)).

20. The Bureau has established, through competent evidence, that Defaulting
Defendant received $4,992,606 in unlawful advance fees, net of refunds, from 1,024

consumers, providing a basis for the monetary judgment amount ordered in Section III.

21. A penalty amount of $5,000,000 against the Defaulting Defendant is
appropriate. Defaulting Defendant acted knowingly, or at least recklessly, and therefore,
she could be subject to much higher penalties, but in light of the applicable mitigating

factors, the lower penalty as ordered in Section IV is warranted. 12 U.S.C.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Student-Loan Debt-Relief Operation
for Taking Illegal Advance Fees and Settles with Some Participants

JUL 13, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
complaint in the federal district court for the Central District of California against GST
Factoring, Inc., which runs a student-loan debt-relief business in Texas, and two of its
owners, Rick Graff and Gregory Trimarche, as well as Champion Marketing Solutions, LLC, a
customer service and marketing company, and its owner, Scott Freda. The Bureau also filed
suit against four attorneys, California attorneys Amanda Johanson and Jacob Slaughter,
Arizona attorney David Mize, and Florida attorney Daniel Ruggiero. The Bureau alleges that
the companies, their owners, and the attorneys were part of a nationwide student-loan
debt-relief operation that charged thousands of consumers saddled with private student-
loan debt approximately $11.8 million in illegal upfront fees in violation of the
Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR). Concurrent with the complaint, the Bureau and four of the
defendants filed proposed stipulated final judgments and orders to resolve the claims
against them. If entered by the court, the orders will ban Trimarche, Slaughter, Mize, and
Ruggiero from participating in certain activities, impose monetary judgments to provide
consumer redress totaling approximately $11.8 million, and impose a civil money penalty.

Under the TSR, it is illegal to request or receive any fees for debt-relief services sold through
telemarketing before the debt is settled or renegotiated. But, as the complaint alleges, from
2015 through the present, the defendants violated the TSRâs prohibition on requesting or
receiving advance fees for debt-relief services, or substantially assisted others in violating
this prohibition by charging illegal advance fees purportedly to renegotiate student loan
debt. As the complaint alleges, the defendants did not wait to complete their work for
consumers, and instead charged fees right away by arranging for monthly payments over
the course of years that began at or just after consumers signed up for defendantsâ services.
Using telemarketing campaigns, the debt-relief operation led consumers to believe that
they were working solely with an attorney, but in fact, the feesâwhich were as large as about
40 percent of the consumersâ outstanding student-loan debtâwent to defendant GST
Factoring, which distributed the funds to the participants in the scheme. The complaint also
alleges that consumers were encouraged to stop paying their student loans all together.

The Bureau negotiated proposed stipulated final judgments and orders with four of the
defendants that were filed alongside the complaint. If entered by the court, the proposed
orders will permanently ban Trimarche from providing debt-relief services and
telemarketing any consumer financial product or service and impose permanent debt-relief
bans on Slaughter, Mize, and Ruggiero. The proposed orders would also impose monetary
judgments against the settling defendants to provide redress to the approximately 2,600
consumers who paid a total of approximately $11.8 million to the defendants over the
course of nearly five years. The full judgment amount will be suspended upon the settling
defendantsâ paying a portion of the redress based on their demonstrated inability to pay the
full amount. Each settling defendant will also pay a $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau.
Whenever the Bureau collects a civil money penalty through an enforcement action, that
penalty is deposited into the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. Assuming continued available
funds, the Bureau will work to provide full relief to eligible harmed consumers from this
fund.

If the proposed orders are entered by the Court, the Bureauâs lawsuit would continue to
proceed against Defendants GST Factoring, Champion Marketing Solutions, Graff, Freda,
and Johanson. The complaint seeks redress to consumers, an injunction, and the imposition
of civil money penalties against them. The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the
defendants have violated the law.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
Harbour is a Texas limited-liability company that formerly entered into
contracts for deed with consumers. Harbour has now ceased operations

and is in the process of dissolution. Under the terms of these contracts,
AAAS Per AAR A am -. Lo peer PAR PRR AMA PA â gc ya
POO ALB AAA Mnciirrant 4 Mitel MR POR PIMA Mana of ot 34
vt ade PS Se beret Pe ea goat Salt aber ay : Bi gate 2 rs ey Stel. BM ee
ae WA A ha Ne od oat ! = POPPA Le a OS bo CAM Mh aA?

consumers are obligated to pay a fixed principal over a term of years with
an interest rate. These contracts therefore constitute âcreditâ under

Â§ 5481(7) of the CFPA. Harbour is therefore a âcovered personâ under

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5)(A), (6)(A), (7), (15)(A)G).

NAA was a South Carolina limited-liability company that dissolved in 2018.
NAM is a South Carolina limited-liability company.

NAA advertised available homes for sale and serviced and maintained the
subject properties on behalf of Harbour. NAM arranged for consumers to
enter into contracts for deed with Harbour. NAM served as the primary
conduit for consumer communications as well as the delivery of
information to consumer-reporting agencies. During the last several years of
Harbourâs operations, NAM was responsible for fielding consumer
inquiries and disputes and for the reporting of information to consumer-
reporting agencies regarding consumer inquiries and disputes.

NAA and NAM therefore serviced the contracts provided by Harbour and
are thus âcovered personsâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5)(A),
(6)(A), (7), 15 )(A)(@).

By furnishing information about the contracts to a consumer-reporting

agency, NAM is a âfurnisherâ under Regulation V. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.41.
10.

11.

12.

13.

14.

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Acts or Practices
Regarding Credit Reporting

Beginning in 2010 until at least 2016, Harbourâs business plan was to
acquire foreclosed properties in bulk, at auction, from entities such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, and resell them to private individuals through cash
sales, bank financing, and primarily through seller financing in the form of
contracts for deed. NAA and NAM acted as Harbourâs agents during the
sales, origination, and servicing process.

NAM furnished information about consumersâ payment histories to a
consumer-reporting agency.

Between at least 2012 and 2016, when consumers called NAA or NAM to
complain about errors on their consumer reports relating to their transactions
with Harbour, they told some consumers that the only way for a consumer to
get help was to file a dispute with the consumer-reporting agency.

When a furnisher represents to a consumer that the only way for

consumers to initiate credit disputes is by filing a dispute with a
consumer-reporting agency, such representation is inaccurate as a

matter of law.

Instead, Regulation V requires furnishers of credit information to investigate
written disputes it may receive and to contact the applicable consumer-

reporting agency in order to resolve any found errors. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43.

Also, furnishers of credit information may investigate a consumer-initiated

dispute based solely on a consumerâs phone call.

When consumers are provided inaccurate information about how they can
initiate credit inquiries or disputes, their rights may be impeded in their
efforts to ensure that their consumer reports are accurate. The added hurdle
of filing a dispute with the consumer-reporting agency could slow the
process, leaving the consumer with an inaccurate report for a longer time.
In some cases, adding additional burdens on the consumers could
discourage consumers from making efforts to try to initiate disputes in the

first place.

An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is material to consumers is information that is likely to
affect a consumerâs conduct regarding the product or service. Express
claims are presumptively material.

The information provided to Harbourâs consumers described above is
material because it was express and because it would likely affect a
consumerâs conduct regarding how to go about getting consumer-

reporting errors resolved.
20. Therefore, Respondents engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation

of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Regulation V and FCRA
for Failing to Establish and Implement Required Policies and Procedures

21. Regulation V requires furnishers to âestablish and implement reasonable
written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the
information relating to consumers that it furnishes to a consumer reporting
agency.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(a).

22. The policies and procedures must be appropriate to the nature, size,
complexity, and scope of the furnisherâs activities and must consider the
guidelines contained in Appendix E of the Furnisher Rule. 12 C.F.R. Â§
1022.42(a)-(b).

23. | Appendix E includes guidance to: (1) establish and implement internal
controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to
consumer-reporting agencies about consumers; (2) train staff that furnish
information; (3) provide appropriate and effective oversight of service
providers; (4) delete, update, and correct information in the furnisherâs
records, as appropriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate information; (5)
design appropriate technology to communicate with consumer-reporting
agencies; and (6) conduct a periodic evaluation of its policies and

procedures. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022, Appendix E.
24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

Appendix E also directs furnishers to consider âfeedback received from
consumer reporting agencies, consumers, or other appropriate parties.â 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1022, Appendix E.

NAM has a Quality Control Manual, which contains a section relating to
consumer reporting (the Policy).

In large part, the Policy summarizes some of FCRA and Regulation Vâs
requirements, and states that NAMâs servicing manager will conduct
âroutine FDCPA and FCRA refreshers and seminars.â The Policy does not
delineate any specific guidance for complying with FCRA or Regulation V,
nor does it lay out any processes regarding the accuracy and integrity of
information furnished to consumer-reporting agencies other than stating the

person to whom employees should address questions.

NAM did not provide adequate training for its staff. Consequently,
consumers were, at times, misled about how to resolve consumer-

reporting errors. NAM also did not update their policies and procedures in
response to the consumer complaintsâfeedback from consumers

discussed in Appendix Eâthat should have put NAM on notice that its
credit reporting may have been inaccurate.

NAM therefore violated Regulation V by failing to establish and implement

the required reasonable written policies and procedures. 12 C.F.R.

binding on the Bureau.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Harbour must pay the

applicable civil money penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the
Bureauâs agent in compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date or by July 3, 2020, whichever is

wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in compliance

with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

Each civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

Each Respondent, for all purposes, must treat any civil money penalty paid
under this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of
how the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondents may not:

a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification
from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondents may not argue that Respondents are entitled
to, nor may Respondents benefit by, any offset or reduction of any
compensatory monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action
because of the civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any
payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in
any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of
compensatory monetary remedies imposed against a Respondent based on
the civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, that Respondent must, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the
Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury.
Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty and
will not change the amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this

action.

In the event of any default on any Respondentâs obligation to make
payment under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28
U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts
not paid from the date of default to the date of payment and will

immediately become due and payable.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Contract for Deed Companies
for Engaging in Deceptive Acts and Practices and Violating Credit Reporting
Rules

JUN 23, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled
with Harbour Portfolio Advisors, LLC (Harbour); National Asset Advisors, LLC (NAA); and
National Asset Mortgage, LLC (NAM), companies that worked together to issue contracts for
deeds to consumers. Under the terms of the contracts, consumers repaid a fixed principal
over a term of years with interest. Harbourâs business plan was to acquire foreclosed
properties in bulk, at auction, from entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and resell
them to individual consumers. Harbour targeted potential buyers who were for the most
part unable to obtain conventional financing and offered them financing through contracts
for deed. Between 2012 and 2016, several thousand consumers initiated contracts for

deeds with Harbour. NAA and NAM, as Harbourâs agents, then serviced the contracts by
collecting payments, fielding disputes from consumers, and speaking with consumers about
the contractsâ terms. Harbour is a Texas limited-liability company. NAA and NAM are South
Carolina limited-liability companies; NAA dissolved in 2018 . As Harbourâs agent, NAM
furnishes consumer credit information to credit-reporting agencies.

The Bureauâs investigation found that between 2012 and 2016, when consumers called
NAA or NAM to complain about errors on their consumer reports relating to their financing
with Harbour, they were sometimes told that they had to file a dispute with the consumer-
reporting agency. These representations were inaccurate and constituted deceptive acts
and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act. Regulation V, which
implements the Fair Credit Reporting Act, required NAA or NAM to investigate written
disputes and contact the consumer-reporting agency to resolve any errors. Also, either
company could investigate a consumer-reporting complaint based solely on a consumer's
phone call, and if they discovered an error, could fix the error by contacting the consumer-
reporting agency. The Bureau also found that NAM lacked adequate policies and
procedures to protect the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer-
reporting agencies, in violation of Regulation V.

Under the settlement, Harbour will pay a $25,000 civil money penalty to the Bureau, and
NAA and NAM will jointly pay a $10,000 civil money penalty to the Bureau. The companies
also agreed not to misrepresent or assist others in misrepresenting, expressly or impliedly,
how consumers can resolve errors in their consumer reports or any other material fact
concerning their consumer reports. NAM agreed to establish and implement reasonable
written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information that it
furnishes to consumer-reporting agencies, and a plan to review such policies and
procedures periodically to update them as necessary to ensure their continued
effectiveness.

Since January 2016, Hypotec has mailed milhons of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in about [0 states.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have recerved at least one of Hypotecâs
direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have obtained
mortgages through Hypotec.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
Federal consumer financial law contams numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Hypotec was responsible for both the content of,
and the dissermmation of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,

as described below.

Faise, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations About Cost
Most of Hypotecâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and payment amount.
By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Hypotec represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms,
In fact, Hypotec did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

athe A A

In numerous imstances, Hypotec misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Malhons of Hypotec mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement and in the 60 days preceding, Hypotec was not actually
prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Hypotec sent about $50,000 advertisements to consumers
between June 2018 and January 2019 that advertised a mortgage with a
2,/5% mtroductory interest rate and an APR of 2.788%.

But Hypotec did not offer such a loan, as reflected in the rate sheets of its
lenders.

Hypotec also sent about 2 milhon advertisements to consumers between
December 2016 and May 2018 offering an adjustable-rate mortgage with a
three-year introductory interest rate of 2.25% andan APR of 2.461%.

But Hypotec aiso did not offer such a loan, as reflected in the rate sheets of
its lenders.

Accordingly, Hypotec misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Hypotec sent about 2.9 million of these advertisements to servicemembers

and veterans.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27â33
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtamme a loan.

Faise and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Hypotec mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly or

by implication, using formats and phrases, that Hypotec was affihated with

the United States government, including the VA, that the advertised product

was endorsed, sponsored by, or affihated with the United States government,

or that the United States government was the source of the advertisements.

For example, each of about 3.2 milhon Hypotec advertisements sent to

servicemembers and veterans contained the following statements:

dk. âVA-1211 Benefit Allotment Noticeâ positioned in the upper corner
of the letter;

b. âUnderstanding your VA Benefit Statementâ centered prominently im
bold letters across the top of the letter;

c. That the recipient has been âtagged for mclusion m our VA IRREL

These statements and other characteristics relatmg to the mailing strongly

implied that the solicitations were being sent by or on behalf of the United

States government, inchiding the VA.

In fact, those representations were false because Hypotec was not affillated

with the United States government, nor were the products offered im these

False and Misleading Representations About an
Escrow Refund Amount

About 3.2 milion of the advertisements Hypotec sent between June 2016
and January 2019 stated that a recipient will receive an âEST. ESCROW
REPOND AMOUN'Tâ of a specific amount if that consumer refinances his
or her mortgage.
The escrow refund amounts that Hypotec advertised were calculated using a
methodology that had no bearmg on the actual escrow refund amount.
Moreover, Hypotec frequently required a consumer to fund a new escrow
account upon generating a new loan.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 42-44
were likely to be misied by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtamimyg a loan.
Faise Representations About the

Time-Limited Availability of the VA-Loan Program
About 450,000 of the advertisements Hypotec sent stated: âthe Economic

Stimulus Program.â

This statement regarding the purported time-limited availability of the VA
loan program was untrue.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 47 and
4% were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Many of Hypotecâs mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a new
loan payment and an mtroductory interest rate for adrustable mortgages.
Under certain sections of Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d), and (),
the use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements. About 3.2
mulhon of Hypotecâs advertisements mcluded these trigger terms, but did not
mclude the other disclosures that are required, or did not include them m the
manner required.
In addition, about 1.8 millon of Hypotecâs mortgage advertisements stated
the name of the consumerâs current lender, but did not inclide the additional
disclosures required by Regulation Zim Â§ 1026.24@)(4).

Disclosures Triggered by Payment Amount

Numerous Hypotec morigage advertisements stated the amount of a new

loan payment, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the

recipientâs repayment obhgations over the full term of the loan, as required
by section 1026.24(d).

For example, 3.2 milion Hypotec advertisements sent to consumers stated a
ânew principal and interest paymentâ reflecting a new monthly payment
amount, a simple interest rate,an APR, and the phrase â3 year ARMâ in
smaller font at the bottom of the page.

But these advertisements did not state the period of the loan or the number
of required payments. Moreover, the payment amount advertised was
applicable for only the first three years of the loan, but the advertisements
did not disclose the subsequent payments required over the full term of the
loan, as required by Â§ 1026.24(a)(2yan.

Ot these advertisements, 2.9 million also failed to disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner the amount of each payment that would apply over the
term of the loan, the period during which each payment would apply, and the
fact, applicable to these loans, that the payments did not mclude amounts for
taxes and insurance premiums and that the actual payment obhgation would
be greater, as required by Â§ 1026.24()(3).

For example, the advertisements proviied the amount of the recipientâs new
monthly payment, but included neither the amount of each payment that

would apply over the term of the loan (despite stating in small print that the

would apply. Furthermore, the advertisements failed to disclose that the
advertised payment amounts excluded taxes and msurance and that the

actual payment obligation would be greater.

Disclosures Triggered by Introductory Interest Rate
Numerous Hypotec mortgage advertisements offering a loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply included a simple annual rate of interest,

Disclosures Triggered by Current Lender Name
Numerous Hypotec mortgage advertisements used the name of the
consumerâs current lender, but failed to disclose Hypotecâs name with equal
prominence, orto include a clear and conspicuous statement that Hypotec
was not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the consumerâ s current
lender, as required by section 1026.24G).
For example, Hypotec sent about 1.8 mulhon advertisements that featured
the name of the consumerâs current lender on the top of the advertisement
and on the envelope in large, bold type.
The advertisements contaimed a disclosure in small type at the bottom of the
advertisement stating that the âofferis made by Hypotec, Inc.â and that the
company was not affiliated with the consumerâs current lender, but this
disclosure was not âwith equal prominenceâ to the use of the current
lenderâs name.
The advertisements also did not contain a clear and conspicuous disclosure
that Hypotec was not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the consumer's

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Fifth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

SEP 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Hypotec, Inc., a mortgage broker based in Miami, Florida that is
licensed in eight states. Hypotec offers and provides mortgage loans guaranteed by the
United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Hypotec advertises its VA-guaranteed
loans to United States military servicemembers and veterans through direct-mail
advertisements. The Bureau found that in advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages Hypotec
sent consumers numerous mailers that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate
statements or that lacked required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial
Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts
and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires
Hypotec to pay a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future
violations.

Todayâs action is the fifth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.
The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of investigations
reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the financial

marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers, veterans, and
surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that, since 2016, Hypotec disseminated advertisements that contained
false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures.
For example, Hypotec advertised specific credit terms, such as interest rates, APRs, and
hypothetical payment amounts that it was not prepared to offer, or that it could only offer
for an introductory period but advertised as if they were permanent loan terms. Hypotecâs
advertisements also used phrasing and formatting that falsely represented or implied that
Hypotec was affiliated with the government, including the VA, that the advertised product
was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the United States government, or that the
United States government was the source of the advertisements. In addition, in
advertisements mailed between June 2016 and January 2019, Hypotec stated that it would
pay an estimated escrow refund of a specific amount if the consumer refinanced through
Hypotec, even though the advertised escrow refund amount was calculated using a method
that would not yield an actual estimate for that consumer, and customers were required to
fund escrow accounts upon generating a new loan. Its advertisements also falsely stated:
âthe Economic Stimulus Program will end soon. There is currently no plan to extend the
Stimulus Program.â Finally, many Hypotec advertisements included claims or terms that
require additional disclosures, but Hypotec failed to make these disclosures.

The consent order against Hypotec requires Hypotec to pay a civil penalty of $50,000. The
consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including requiring
Hypotec to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising compliance
official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage
advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those identified
by the Bureau; and requiring Hypotec to comply with certain enhanced disclosure
requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

The consent order against Hypotec can be found at:

INTRODUCTION

1. This case concerns an illegal debt-collection scheme involving a
network of interrelated companies that purchases millions of dollars of
defaulted consumer debt and, using deceptive and harassing methods,
collects on that debt illegally (the Debt-Collection Operation).

2. The Debt-Collection Operation, which has operated from at
least 2015 through the present, is owned and run by Di Re and Croce and
managed by Koziel and Gracie.

3. The Debt-Collection Operation uses illegal methods to induce
consumers to make payments, including: threatening consumers with
arrest or legal action the firms had no intention of taking or could not
legally take; threatening to contact consumersâ employers, implying they
would disclose the existence of the debt; claiming consumers owed more
debt than they did in order to convince them to pay the amount they owed;

impermissibly contacting consumersâ friends, family, and workplace to

disclose the existence of a consumerâs debt or to shame or humiliate them
about the debt; harassing consumers by using intimidating, belittling, or
menacing language and repeatedly and excessively phoning consumers;
and failing to provide legally required notices informing consumers of
their right to know how much they owed and of their ability to dispute the
amount or existence of the purported debt.

4. Defendantsâ illegal debt-collection practices violate the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a),
5536(a), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.

15. The Corporate Defendants operate as a common enterprise.
The Corporate Defendants are under common control, operate out of a
combined headquarters, and commingle funds, with one entity purchasing
and selling debt that the other entities collect. Collectors employed by the
Corporate Defendants share training materials and compete against each
other for workplace incentives. Collectors use various Corporate
Defendant names when identifying themselves to consumers in order to
cause consumers to believe that a debt has been sold to or placed with a
new collection agency when, in fact, the debt has not been sold or placed
outside the Debt-Collection Operation.

16. Because the Corporate Defendants operate as a common

enterprise, an act by one entity constitutes an act by each entity
comprising the common enterprise, and each is jointly and severally liable
for the acts and practices of all the Corporate Defendants, as alleged below.

17. From at least 2012 through the present, Christopher L. Di Re
has held ownership interests in some or all of the Corporate Defendants,
including Regency, ROC, CSA, and JPL. He holds the title of President,
CEO, or is an officer in Regency, ROC, CSA, and JPL, and has materially
participated in the conduct of their affairs. Di Re is therefore a ârelated
personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(i), Gi). Because Di Re is
a ârelated person,â he is deemed a âcovered personâ for purposes of the
CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).

18. From at least 2015 through the present, Scott A. Croce has held
ownership interests in some or all of the Corporate Defendants, including
Regency, ROC, and CSA. He has materially participated in the conduct of
the affairs of the Corporate Defendants. Croce is therefore a ârelated
personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(i), Gi). Because Croce is
a ârelated person,â he is deemed a âcovered personâ for purposes of the
CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).

19. From at least 2015 through the present, Brian J. Koziel has had
a management role in the Debt-Collection Operation. He has had an

ownership interest in and has been an officer of at least one of the

Corporate Defendants, CSA, and has been identified as a âmanagerâ of JPL
and a âmanaging memberâ of Keystone. He has been charged with
managerial responsibility for, and has materially participated in the
conduct of the affairs of, some or all of the Corporate Defendants. Koziel is
therefore a ârelated personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(i),
(ii). Because Koziel is a ârelated person,â he is deemed a âcovered personâ
for purposes of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).

20. From at least 2015 through at least June 2020, Marc D. Gracie
has had a management role in the Debt-Collection Operation. He has been
identified as a âmanagerâ of JPL and a âmanaging memberâ of Keystone.
He has been charged with managerial responsibility for, and has materially
participated in the conduct of the affairs of, some or all of the Corporate
Defendants. Gracie is therefore a ârelated personâ under the CFPA. 12

FACTS

21. The Debt-Collection Operation is operated by the Corporate
Defendants, a series of interrelated companies that conduct business out of
a single location in the Buffalo, New York area.

22. Through one or more of the Corporate Defendants, such as
Regency, the Debt-Collection Operation obtains defaulted consumer debt
for pennies on the dollar. A substantial portion of the defaulted debt
obtained by the Debt-Collection Operation for collection during the past
year consists of high-interest personal loans originated by the lender
LoanMe, Inc. (LoanMe), although the Debt-Collection Operation has also
obtained for collection defaulted installment loans, defaulted payday loans,
and defaulted credit card debt from various other sources. Some of this
debt is purchased outright while some of this debt is transferred or placed
for collection in another manner, such as a lease.

23. Through about 40 collectors employed by at least two of the
Corporate Defendants, such as ROC and CSA, the Debt-Collection
Operation collects or attempts to collect debt from consumers under the

names of one or more of the Corporate Defendants.

10
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 11 of 46

24. These collectors routinely engage in a wide range of deceptive
and other illegal collection tactics in connection with the collection of this
debt.

25. Using these illegal tactics, the Debt-Collection Operation
appears to have obtained revenues of approximately $10 million in 2015 to
over $23 million in 2018.

False Threats

26. Innumerous instances from at least 2015 through the present,
collectors from the Debt-Collection Operation have threatened consumers
with legal action, including wage garnishment or attachment of property,
or arrest and imprisonment, if they did not make payments.

27. These threats were false.

28. Consumers are not subject to arrest or imprisonment for
failure to pay debts.

29. The Debt-Collection Operation has never sought or obtained a
legal judgment that would be required as a pre-requisite for seeking to
garnish a consumer's wages or attach their property.

30. Docket searches have revealed no debt-collection lawsuits filed

by any of the Corporate Defendants against a consumer.

11
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 12 of 46

Falsely Claiming Consumers Owe More than they Do

31. For the collection of at least LoanMe debt, the Debt-Collection
Operation employs a ruse, which it refers to as its âLoanMe Pitch,â in
which collectors tell consumers that they owe more than they do in order
to convince them that paying the amount they actually owe represents a
substantial discount.

32. Inthe LoanMe Pitch, collectors tell consumers who have
defaulted on LoanMe debt that they are liable for the full amount that they
would have paid if they had made timely payments of principal and
interest for the entire loan period. Collectors from the Debt-Collection
Operation call this the âfull contract balance.â This representation is
bolstered by the fact that it is an amount equal to the âtotal of paymentsâ
appearing in bold letters on the face of the loan agreement.

33. However, consumers do not owe this amount on a defaulted
loan; they only owe the remaining unpaid principal of the loan plus any
unpaid contractually authorized amounts. Depending on when the
consumer defaulted in the loan contract period, the supposed âfull contract
balanceâ may be thousands of dollars more than the actual amount owed.

34. The Debt-Collection Operation instructs its collectors to tell

consumers that the original creditor could pursue them for the âfull

12
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 13 of 46

contract balance,â but they have an âopportunityâ to âsave... a ton of
moneyâ by paying the amount demanded by the collectors, which is the
amount actually owed (or sometimes less). Collectors are told to present
this as an offer that will only be available for a short period of time.

35. Infact, no consumers who defaulted on their LoanMe loans
owe the âfull contract balance,â and neither LoanMe nor the Debt-
Collection Operation have the right to pursue that amount from
consumers.

Contacting and Disclosing Debt to Third Parties

 

36. From at least 2015, the Debt-Collection Operation has
contacted friends, family, work colleagues, or supervisors of consumers in
order to pressure consumers to pay the debts under collection.

37. In this tactic, collectors for the Debt-Collection Operation
begin their collection efforts by using a skip tracing service and social
media to identify the consumerâs address, other location information
relating to the consumer, and, most importantly, third parties associated
with that consumer. This is called the âCirclesâ approach by the Debt-
Collection Operation because the collector can visualize these third parties
in a series of concentric circles around the consumer, who is at the bullâs

eye center. The surrounding circles consist of immediate family members,

eASE Lee OVeGie id fÂ£ GPOCUTAEND 2 PHO OsiVorcQ Pade 14 OF at

grandparents, distant family members, in-laws, ex-spouses, employers,
work colleagues, landlords, Facebook friends, and other known associates.

38. The collector then begins calling each of these third parties
under the pretense of attempting to find the consumer, although the
collector already has location information for the consumer. During these
calls, the collectors expressly or implicitly disclose that the consumer is in
debt or in some type of distress or difficulty. The Debt-Collection
Operation does this to âstir the pot,â so that the third parties start calling
the consumer. Thus, the consumerâs family, friends, and colleagues can
serve as the collectorâs âarmy,â pressuring the consumer to address the
collector's demands.

39. Collectors reach out to the consumer only after they have set
their âarmyâ of third parties in motion.

40. Debt-Collection Operation collectors have used this approach
even after a consumer has spoken to a collector and asked to halt further
communications, or after a consumer has initiated but then stopped
payments to the collector.

41. Consumers have described these tactics as âsmear

99 66 99 66

campaign[s|,â âextortion,â âterrorist collecting tactics,â and âemotional

terrorism.â In explaining why their collectors should follow the âCirclesâ

14
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 15 of 46

approach, the Debt-Collection Operation equates it to a form of
repossession, telling collectors: âIf I buy a car and I donât pay for it. . . they
take the car. If I donât pay for my house, they take the house... .[WHJeâre
taking [their] pride... .â

Harassing Consumers and Third Parties

42. Innumerous instances, Debt-Collection Operation collectors
have harassed consumers or third parties related to those consumers to
coerce payment.

43. Many consumers have complained that calls from the Debt-
Collection Operation to their employers or work colleagues potentially
jeopardized their jobs. Multiple consumers expressed concerns about
collectors continuing to phone consumers at work despite being told the
consumerâs workplace prohibits the consumer from receiving such
communications.

44. Many consumers have complained that collectors from the
Debt-Collection Operation also have used insulting and belittling language,
or engaged in intimidating behavior when calling consumers or third
parties. Consumers have also complained, as described above, that

collectors from the Debt-Collection Operation used threats of legal action,

15

ra

garnishment, arrest, or imprisonment, as well as threats to call consumersâ
workplaces.

45. The Circles scheme, described above, is another harassment
tactic, intended to intimidate or embarrass consumers into paying to stop
the calls.

46. Collectors from the Debt-Collection Operation also repeatedly
call consumers to induce payment. Many consumers complained that
collectors called them more than once a day over prolonged periods of
time, with several complaining of multiple calls every day over periods
lasting a month or longer.

47. These repeated calls to consumers reflect an intent to harass,
evidenced by the Debt-Collection Operationâs âzero gapâ calling strategy.
This practice requires collectors to press consumers âevery single dayâ for
payment, even after they make contact and have a live conversation with
the consumer. The Debt-Collection Operation instructs its collectors that
they should let the consumer hang up on each call so they can maintain a
pretense in their call logs that they were disconnected, and then call back

as soon as the next day.

16
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 17 of 46

48. According to consumer complaints, many collectors continued
to call consumers even after the consumer asked them to stop, hung up on
them, or told them they would not or could not pay.

Failing to Provide Debt Verification Rights Notices

49. Debt collectors are required to send a notice within five days
after the initial communication with the consumer. This legally mandated
notice must tell consumers (1) the amount of the alleged debt; (2) the
name of the creditor to whom the purported debt is owed; (3) a statement
that unless the consumer disputes the debt, the debt will be assumed valid;
(4) a statement that if the consumer disputes all or part of the debt in
writing within 30 days, the debt collector will obtain verification of the
debt and mail it to the consumer; and (5) a statement that, upon the
consumer's written request within the 30-day period, the debt collector
will provide the name and address of the original creditor, if different from
the current creditor. Collectors are not required to send the notice if this
information is contained in the initial communication with the consumer.

50. The Debt-Collection Operation did not provide the statutorily-
required notices. Many consumers reported that the collector claimed to

have sent such notices, even though they never received them. Some

17
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 18 of 46

consumers said collectors refused to provide such notices, wrongly stating
they were not obligated to send them.

51. Because consumers did not receive the validation notice, they
were not informed that they must dispute the debt in writing in order to
require the collector to provide verification of the debt. When consumers
made the verification request orally, Corporate Defendants did not provide
verification or cease collection. According to consumer complaints, some
consumers who asked for a physical address to send such a request were
denied that information.

Role and Knowledge of the Individual Defendants

52. Di Re and Croce together appear to own nearly 100% of at least
three of the Corporate Defendants. They are bank signatories or officers of
certain Corporate Defendants. They also co-own the LLC that purchased
the building out of which the Debt-Collection Operation is run.

53. Di Re and Croce are owners who are in the office regularly and
approve, adopt, or ratify the Corporate Defendantsâ unlawful collection
practices, including by meeting regularly with the Corporate Defendantsâ
managers to rate randomly-selected collectorsâ calls to ensure adherence to
company policies. Di Re and Croce also regularly monitor collectorsâ

calling patterns to ensure there are no âgapsâ in their calling of consumers.

18
They award workplace incentives to the employees who earn the most
money for the Corporate Defendants. Di Re encourages collectors to
contact him directly for advice on how to improve their collection skills
and earn more money for themselves and the Corporate Defendants.

54. Koziel and Gracie have been held out as âmembersâ of
Keystone. Koziel has also been held out as a manager of JPL, and as
President, one-third owner (until sometime in 2018 when he transferred
his interest to Di Re and Croce), Compliance Officer, and bank signatory
for CSA. Koziel is identified in collectorsâ employee handbooks as their
supervisor. Gracie has been held out as an officer or manager of ROC and
JPL.

55. Koziel revises and approves talk-off scripts, meets with Di Re
and Croce regularly, and is responsible for recruiting new employees.
Koziel and Gracie have both worked to hire new collectors for the Debt-
Collection Operation through social media as recently as April 2020.

56. Di Re, Croce, Gracie, and Koziel knew about, were reckless to
the fact of, or ignored red flags reflecting, the practices described above.
This was the case through their management, authority, and control over

the Debt-Collection Operation.

19
57. Collectors were told that Di Re and Croce reviewed recordings
of their collection calls twice weekly with managers of the Debt-Collection
Operation.

58. Collectors were told that Di Re and Croce reviewed their
training session, at which some of the tactics described above were
explained.

59. The training manual used for the Debt-Collection Operation
describes how collectors should use skip-tracing software, Facebook, and
Google to locate a consumerâs parents, in-laws, grandparents, grand-
parent in-laws, siblings, cousins, employers, friends lists, other possible
relatives, and other likely associates that are at the heart of the Circles
approach. The training manual also includes scripts detailing how to
present the LoanMe Pitch to consumers, and scripts instructing collectors
to say their company will âexplore every means necessaryâ if consumers
refuse to pay. The âCSA+ROCâ Employee Handbook included in the
training materials identifies Brian Koziel as a âsupervisor.â

60. Since 2015, numerous consumer complaints have been lodged
against the Debt-Collection Operation through the Bureau, NYAG, other
law enforcement agencies, and consumer organizations, each of which

identified at least one of the debt-collection practices described above.

Many of these complaints were forwarded to the Debt-Collection
Operation for its response.

61. In 2018, the BBB publicly issued a âscam trackerâ warning
against API (one of ROCâs dbas) stating âBBB just wants to advise you to
not pay any debt to API Recovery Solutions.â The BBB also publicly
assigned F ratings to JPL, Warner (one of CSAâs dbas), and API. Koziel
and Gracie are listed as points of contact for complaints from the BBB and
the Bureau.

62. Since 2015, more than 20 private lawsuits have been filed by
consumers against varying Corporate Defendants relating to the Debt-
Collection Operation, with several naming Di Re, Koziel, and Gracie
personally, alleging some of the debt-collection practices described above.

63. The Corporate Defendants were subject to high chargeback
rates in connection with their work for the Debt-Collection Operation.
High chargeback rates are a red flag for wrongdoing, and as owners and
managers, the Individual Defendants would have notice of the chargeback
rates. Koziel and Gracie are listed as points of contact for complaints and

chargebacks from the Corporate Defendantsâ payment processor.

71. Section 804 of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692b, provides that
any debt collector communicating with any person other than the
consumer for the purpose of acquiring location information about the
consumer shall identify his employer only if expressly asked and may not
state that the consumer owes any debt.

72. Section 805(b) of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692c(b), prohibits
communications about a debt with any person other than the consumer or
the consumerâs attorney, a consumer reporting agency, the creditor or the

Section 804 of the FDCPA, with the permission of the consumer or a court
of competent jurisdiction, or as reasonably necessary to effectuate
postjudgment relief. For the purpose of Section 805(b), Section 805 of the
FDCPA defines the term âconsumerâ to include âthe consumerâs spouse,

the prior consent of the consumer or the express permission of a court of
competent jurisdiction, and when not reasonably necessary to effectuate a
post judgment judicial remedy, in violation of Section 805(b) of the
FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692c(b).

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA AS TO ALL DEFENDANTS

COUNT V
Deception Under the CFPA Relating to Collection of, and Attempts to

Collect, Debts
(All Defendants)

87. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 5,
7-35, 52-63.

88. Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or
practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B). An act or practice is deceptive if it
involves a material misrepresentation that is likely to mislead a consumer
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

89. Innumerous instances, in connection with the collection of
purported consumer debts, Corporate Defendants have represented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that:

a. Corporate Defendants will have the consumer arrested or
imprisoned for nonpayment;
b. Corporate Defendants would file lawsuits against consumers

if they failed to pay, and that the filing of such lawsuits was

imminent;

29
c. Corporate Defendants would seek to garnish or attach
consumersâ wages or property if they failed to pay; and

d. Consumers owed an amount of money that the Corporate
Defendants described as the âfull contract balance,â and that
the original creditor could seek to collect this amount if it
chose to.

90. Intruth and in fact, where Corporate Defendants have made
the representations set forth in Paragraph 89 of this Complaint:

a. Corporate Defendants have not, and could not have, had
consumers arrested or imprisoned;

b. Corporate Defendants have not filed, and do not intend to
file, lawsuits against consumers for nonpayment;

c. Corporate Defendants would not seek and could not seek to
garnish or attach consumersâ wages or property if they failed
to pay; and

d. Consumers did not owe the amounts Corporate Defendants
described as the âfull contract balance,â and neither
Corporate Defendants nor the original creditor could legally
collect such amounts, which were sometimes thousands of

dollars more than the consumer legally owed.

91. These false and misleading misrepresentations were material
and likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

92. Therefore, the representations set forth in Paragraph 89 of this
Complaint constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of Â§Â§ 1031(a)
and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

93. The Individual Defendants have engaged in these deceptive
acts and practices because they had authority to control these
representations or participated in them. They have known about, have
been reckless to the fact of, or have ignored red flags with respect to, these
false and misleading representations. The Individual Defendants are
therefore liable for these violations of the CFPA.

96. Defendants offer or provide consumer financial products or
services because they collect debts related to consumer financial products
and services, including installment and payday loans. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5),
15(A)(x).

97. As detailed in Counts I through IV, Defendants have engaged
in violations of the FDCPA in the course of their collection of debts related
to consumer financial products or services.

98. Therefore, Defendants are offering consumer financial
products or services not in conformity with Federal consumer financial
law, and have committed acts or omissions in violation of Federal

consumer financial law, in violation of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA, 12

substantial assistance to a covered person or service provider in violation
of the provisions of 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(3).

101. From at least 2015 through the present, as described in Count
V, the Corporate Defendants have engaged in deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 8Â§ 5531 and 5536(a)(1)(B), by making false
or deceptive threats to consumers, and misrepresenting, expressly or by
implication, the amount of debt consumers owed, in order to induce
payments to Corporate Defendants.

102. The Individual Defendants provided substantial assistance to
the Corporate Defendants that engaged in the practices described in Count
V. As owners and managers, they associated themselves with the venture
of the Corporate Defendants and by helping to run the Debt-Collection
Operation, they sought by their actions to make it succeed.

103. The Individual Defendants knew about, or were reckless with

respect to, the deceptive conduct alleged in Count V.

Â§ 1692e(2)(A);

b. Falsely representing that nonpayment of a debt will result in

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and New York Attorney General Take
Action Against Debt-Collection Operation and Its Owners and Managers

SEP 08, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), in partnership
with the New York Attorney General (NYAG), today filed suit against a network of five
different companies based outside of Buffalo, New York, two of their owners, and two of
their managers, for their participation in a debt-collection operation using illegal methods
to collect debts. The company defendants are: JPL Recovery Solutions, LLC; Regency One
Capital LLC; ROC Asset Solutions LLC, which does business as API Recovery Solutions;
Check Security Associates LLC, which does business as Warner Location Services and
Orchard Payment Processing Systems; and Keystone Recovery Group. The individual
defendants are Christopher Di Re and Scott Croce, who have held ownership interests in
some or all of the defendant companies, and Brian Koziel and Marc Gracie, who are
members of Keystone Recovery Group, and have acted as managers of some or all of the
defendant companies. The complaint alleges that from at least 2015 through the present,
the defendants have participated in a debt-collection operation that has used deceptive,
harassing, and improper methods to induce consumers to make payments to them in
violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial
Protection Act (CFPA).

""This lawsuit should send a clear message to debt collectors who violate the law that we will
take action to stop such practices and protect consumers,"" said Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau Director Kathleen L. Kraninger. ""The Bureau is committed to holding
these companies and individuals accountable for threatening, harassing, and deceiving
consumers. | thank Attorney General James and her staff for working with us on this matter.""

""We will not sit idly by as debt collectors extort payment from consumers by using illegal,
deceitful tactics,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James. ""Collecting on money that
consumers do not oweâand doing so using false threats of arrest and other unscrupulous
means-âis inexcusable and unlawful. My office is committed to defending the rights of New
Yorkers, and | thank the CFPB for their partnership in this case.""

The complaint, which the Bureau and NYAG filed in the federal district court for the Western
District of New York, alleges that defendants violated several provisions of the FDCPA by
threatening consumers with arrest or legal action the firms had no intention of taking or
could not legally take; threatening to contact consumersâ employers to disclose the debt;
claiming consumers owed more debt than they did in order to convince them to pay the
amount they owed; impermissibly contacting consumersâ friends, family, and workplace to
disclose the existence of a consumer's debt or to shame or humiliate them; harassing
consumers by using intimidating, belittling, or menacing language and repeatedly and
excessively phoning consumers; and failing to provide legally required notices informing
consumers of their right to know how much they owed and of their ability to dispute the
amount or existence of the purported debt.

The complaint further alleges that defendants engaged in deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA by misrepresenting that they would have the consumer arrested, that
they would file lawsuits they did not intend to file, that they would garnish the wages of the
consumer, and that the consumer owed more than they actually did. The complaint also
alleges that the violations of the FDCPA constituted violations of the CFPA and that the
individual defendants substantially assisted the firms in their deceptive conduct.

The NYAG additionally alleges violations of New York law based on the same conduct.

enforce its rights to any payment or monetary judgment under this Order, such as a
nondischargeability complaint in any bankruptcy case.

action by the Bureau under Â§ 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§ 523(a)(2)(A),
and for such purposes this Order will have collateral estoppel effect against each Defendant,

because of the civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related Consumer Action
offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary remedies tmposed
against Defendant based on the civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any
payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, Defendant must, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau and pay
the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be
considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the amount of the civil

money penalty imposed in this action.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with LendUp Loans, LLC for Military
Lending Act Violations

JAN 19, 2021

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
proposed settlement to resolve its December 4, 2020 lawsuit against LendUp Loans, LLC
(LendUp) alleging violations of the Military Lending Act (MLA). Today's action is the first
resolution in the Bureau's broader sweep of investigations of multiple lenders that may be
violating the MLA. LendUp, which has its principal place of business in Oakland, California,
is an online lender that offers single-payment and installment loans to consumers. If entered
by the court, the proposed settlement would require LendUp to provide $300,000 in
redress to consumers and to pay a $950,000 civil money penalty. The settlement would also
enjoin LendUp from committing future violations of the MLA and from collecting on, selling,
or assigning any debts arising from loans that failed to comply with the MLA. It would also
require LendUp to correct or update the information it provided to consumer reporting
agencies about affected consumers.

The MLA puts in place protections in connection with extensions of consumer credit for
active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, who are defined as âcovered
borrowers.â These protections include a maximum allowable annual percentage rate of
36%, known as a Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR), a prohibition against required
arbitration, and certain mandatory loan disclosures. The Bureau's complaint, filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleged that since October
2016, LendUp made over 4,000 single-payment or installment loans to over 1,200 covered
borrowers in violation of the MLA. The Bureau specifically alleged that LendUpâs violations
of the MLA included extending loans with a MAPR that exceeds the MLAâs 36% cap,
extending loans that require borrowers to submit to arbitration, and failing to make certain
required loan disclosures, including a statement of the applicable MAPR.

IV.
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

4. Lobel is a California corporation with its principal place of business in

Anaheim, California.
10.

Lobel indirectly originates and services subprime auto loans by taking
assignment of retail-installment-sales contracts that automobile dealers make
with borrowers.

These activities are âconsumer financial products and servicesâ under the
CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), IS(A)(G) & (x).

Lobel is therefore a âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6).
Since 2008, Lobel has used LDW. The LDW product is not an insurance
product, though Lobel uses it as a substitute for collateral-protection
insurance.

The LDW agreement specifies that if at any time the borrower fails to
maintain car insurance subject to certain specifications, Lobel will add LDW
coverage to the consumerâs account. When Lobel adds LDW coverage,
Lobel charges the consumer a monthly premium and, in the event of a repair,
Lobel will pay the cost of the repair. In the event of a âtotal vehicle loss,â
Lobel will cancel the borrowerâs debt.

Lobel charges a $70 monthly premium, on average, for LDW coverage.
11.

12.

13.

14.

15.

Findings and Conclusions as to
Charging Delinquent Consumers for LDW

The LDW agreement allows Lobel to cancel the agreement and suspend
coverage if the borrower becomes delinquent on his or her loan by 10 or
more days.

When consumers became 10 days delinquent on their loans, however, Lobel
did not stop charging the monthly premium or otherwise indicate that it was
canceling the LDW coverage. Instead, Lobel continued to charge these
consumers, even though it no longer provided them with LDW coverage.
And when many of these consumers, who had become more than 10 days
delinquent on their auto loans, experienced a âtotal vehicle lossâ or needed a
repair, Lobel denied their claims and did not cancel their debts or cover their
repairs.

Since 2012, in the course of administering the LDW product, at least 2,919
consumers paid monthly LDW premiums when they were more than 10 days
delinquent, yet Lobel did not provide those consumers with LDW coverage.
In addition, since 2012, at least 451 consumers submitted LDW claims for
either âtotal vehicle lossâ or repair that Lobel denied as though their

coverage had been canceled.
16.

17.

18.

19.

Lobel improperly denied at least 261 additional consumersâ LD W claims
and improperly furnished information to the consumer-reporting agencies
indicating that these consumers have outstanding debts totaling at least
$1,744,902.53, as a portion of the debts should not have been charged to the
consumers under the LDW agreement.

These acts and practices violated the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. $$ 5531(c), 5536(a).

Findings and Conclusions as to
Charging Consumers Fees in Excess of $500

The LDW agreement states that when Lobel declares that a vehicle is a total
loss, the borrower must pay the following fees and charges: the first $500 in
damages per loss occurrence; all past-due payments; interest in arrears
through the date of loss; all past-due LDW fees; all late charges; all legal or
collection or repossession fees; impound fees; storage or towing costs
exceeding $150 related to the damage occurrence; and lost-salvage fees
resulting from a lien sale or other event where Lobel cannot recover the
salvage value of the damaged motor vehicle.

Yet, in numerous instances, Lobel assessed and collected two additional fees
not listed in the LDW agreement: (1) the vehicleâs salvage value (even if the
borrower did not wish to retain the vehicle for salvage) and (2) monthly loan

payments from the time the LDW claim was approved and Lobel declared
20.

21.

22.

23.

the vehicle a total loss until the debt was canceled (a process that took Lobel,
on average, 3 months to complete).
Since at least 2011, Lobel assessed and collected LDW claim-related fees
that borrowers were not contractually obligated to pay under their
agreements with Lobel.
In total, at least 607 consumers paid $352,895 in excessive fees during this
period.
These acts and practices violated the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. $$ 5531(c), 5536(a).
V.
Prohibited Conduct
IT IS ORDERED, under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, that:
Respondent and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who
have actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or
indirectly, in connection with the origination and servicing of auto loans, are
permanently restrained and enjoined from:
a. failing to provide consumers with LDW coverage, collateral protection
insurance, or similar products or services for which Respondent has
charged consumers; or

b. charging consumers fees that are not authorized by its LDW contracts.
24.

25.

26.

VI.
Role of the Board
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
The Board must review all submissions (including plans, reports, programs,
policies, and procedures) required by this Consent Order before their
submission to the Bureau.
Although this Consent Order requires Respondent to submit certain
documents to the Regional Director for review or non-objection, the Board
will have the ultimate responsibility for Respondentâs proper and sound
management and for ensuring that Respondent complies with the laws that
the Bureau enforces, including Federal consumer financial laws and this
Consent Order.
Whenever this Consent Order requires the Board to perform or ensure
Respondentâs adherence to certain obligations, the Board must:
a. authorize whatever actions are necessary for Respondent to fully
comply with the Consent Order;

b. require timely reporting by management to the Board on the status of

compliance obligations; and

C. require timely and appropriate corrective action to remedy any
material non-compliance with any failures to comply with Board
directives related to this Section.

VIL.
Order to Pay Redress

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must reserve or deposit

$1,345,224 into a segregated deposit account for the purpose of providing

redress to Affected Consumers as required by this Section.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must submit to the

Enforcement Director for review and non-objection a comprehensive written

plan for providing redress consistent with this Consent Order (Redress Plan).

The Enforcement Director will have the discretion to non-object to the

Redress Plan or to direct Respondent to revise it. If the Enforcement

Director directs Respondent to revise the Redress Plan, Respondent must

revise and resubmit the Redress Plan to the Enforcement Director within 15

days. After receiving notification that the Enforcement Director has no

objection to the Redress Plan, Respondent must implement and adhere to the

steps, recommendations, deadlines, and timeframes outlined in the Redress

Plan.
The Redress Plan must:
a. provide the form, e.g., certified or bank check, in which the required

redress shall be provided to the Affected Consumers;

b. provide the method that will be used to deliver redress to the Affected
Consumers and to ensure the redress was received; and

C. provide the procedure that will be used to request that Consumer
Reporting Agencies (CRAs) to which Respondent furnished
inaccurate information about Affected Consumers, correct or update
the inaccurate information in accordance with 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-
2(a)(2). Where Respondent cannot furnish a correction or update,
Respondent will request that the CRAs to which it furnished the
information delete the tradeline.

After completing the Redress Plan, if the amount of redress provided to

Affected Consumers is less than $1,345,224, within 30 days of the

completion of the Redress Plan, Respondent must pay to the Bureau, by wire

transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent, and according to the

Bureauâs wiring instructions, the difference between the amount of redress
provided to Affected Consumers and $1,345,224.
The Bureau may use these remaining funds to pay additional redress to
Aftected Consumers. If the Bureau determines, in its sole discretion, that
additional redress is wholly or partially impracticable or otherwise
inappropriate, or if funds remain after the additional redress is completed,
the money will not revert to Respondent. Respondent will have no right to
challenge any actions that the Bureau or its representatives may take under
this Section.
Respondent may not condition the payment of any redress to any Affected
Consumer under this Consent Order on that Affected Consumer waiving any
right.
VI.

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section IV of this Consent Order and by
taking into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must

pay the Bureau a $100,000 civil money penalty.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money

penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in

the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund, as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA, 12

U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under

this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how

the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:

a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment
made under any insurance policy, for any civil money penalty paid
under this Consent Order.

To preserve the civil money penaltyâs deterrent effect, Respondent may not

argue in any Related Consumer Action that Respondent is entitled to, nor

may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory

monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the

civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

IX.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and

payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.
Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Regional
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that Respondent paid
or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of
consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Auto Lender for Unfair Loss
Damage Waiver Practices

SEP 21, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. -â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled
with Lobel Financial Corporation, an auto-loan servicer based in Anaheim, California. The
Bureau found that Lobel engaged in unfair practices with respect to its Loss Damage Waiver
(LDW) product, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). When a
borrower has insufficient insurance, rather than force-placing collateral-protection
insurance, Lobel places the LDW product, which is not itself insurance, on borrower
accounts and charges a monthly premium of approximately $70 for the LDW coverage. The
LDW product provides that Lobel will pay for the cost of covered repairs and, in the event of
a total vehicle loss, cancel the borrower's debt. The Bureau found that Lobel continued to
bill certain consumers for LDW coverage but then failed to provide it, and assessed fees
from consumers that they were not obligated to pay. The order requires Lobel to pay
$1,345,224 in consumer redress to approximately 4,000 harmed consumers and a $100,000
civil money penalty. The order also prohibits Lobel from failing to provide consumers with
LDW coverage or similar products or services for which it has charged consumers or from
charging consumers fees that are not authorized by its LDW contracts.

Lobel's LDW agreement, which all Lobel borrowers must sign, specifies that if at any time
the borrower fails to maintain car insurance subject to certain specifications, Lobel will add
LDW coverage to the consumer's account and impose a monthly charge. If a borrower
becomes ten or more days delinquent on an auto loan with LDW coverage, Lobel may stop
the LDW coverage. The Bureau's investigation found that, since 2012, Lobel charged
customers LDW premiums after they had become ten-days delinquent on their auto loans
but did not provide them with LDW coverage. When these customers needed repairs or
experienced total vehicle losses, Lobel denied their claims. This practice was unfair under
the CFPA because consumers were charged for a service that they did not receive.

The Bureau also found that Lobel charged some customers LDW-related fees that Lobel
had not disclosed in its LDW contract. This practice was also unfair under the CFPA.

Low VA Ratesâ mortgage advertisements are advertisements for âclosed-end
credit,â as that term is defined in Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).
Low VA Rates offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed
by the VA.

Low VA Ratesâ principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since January 2016, Low VA Rates has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of Low VA
Ratesâ direct-mail advertisements, and tens of thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through Low VA Rates.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Low VA Rates was responsible for both the
content of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements
during the Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, or inaccurate

statements, as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Low VA Ratesâ mortgage advertisements stated specific credit
terms, such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), payment
amount, index, margin, or closing costs.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Low VA Rates
represented, expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a
mortgage with those credit terms.

In fact, Low VA Rates did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific
credit terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Low VA Ratesâ advertisements misrepresented the
actual credit terms applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.
Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements described mortgages
with a simple interest rate and APR combination that Low VA Rates was not
actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 573,500 mailers to consumers between
April 28, 2017, and November 24, 2017, that advertised a mortgage with a
simple-interest rate of 2.25% for three years and an APR of 3.196%.

In fact, the advertised APR was incorrect for any loan Low VA Rates was

prepared to arrange or offer.

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the
actual APR for loans it was prepared to arrange or offer.

Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements advertised ââcash outâ
credit terms that Low VA Rates did not actually arrange or offer.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that advertised âcash outâ credit
terms that Low VA Rates did not actually arrange or offer. The
advertisement stated that the borrower could âtake $20,000 cash-out for only
$87.48 per month!â

In fact, obtaining any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home equity
was possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and refinanced
the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out refinance
mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than $87.48.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 573,500 mailers to consumers between
April 28, 2017, and November 24, 2017, that advertised $15,000 cash out for
a monthly payment of âas little as $65.â

In fact, obtaining any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home equity
would be possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and
refinanced the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out

refinance mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than $65.

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the
actual monthly payment for loans it offered or was prepared to arrange.
Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements used misleading
statements and rhetorical questions to promote unavailable loan terms.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 1,141,690 mailers to consumers between
January 1, 2016, and September 16, 2016, that prominently referred to a
1.75% fixed simple annual interest rate, and were mailed in an envelope that
stated, âPayment Reduction Entitlement Notice.â The mailer used rhetorical
questions to advertise a 1.75% fixed rate: â[D]oes your VA loan have a fixed
rate of over 1.75%?â and âWhy stay at a rate that is higher than 1.75%?â and
âThese low rates canât last long!â

In fact, Low VA Rates was not prepared to arrange or offer a 1.75% fixed
rate, which the mailerâs fine print confirmed: â[w]e do not have fixed
interest rates at 1.75% currently.â

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented the interest rate for loans
offered or arranged to be offered in these advertisements.

Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
payment amount applicable to the advertised loan and the existence, nature,
or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection with the

mortgage.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers
between September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that described a
mortgage with âNO out of pocket costs,â with a rate that required the
purchase of 2.25 to 2.75 discount points.

In fact, the VA permits an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan
(IRRRL) borrower to finance only two points, 38 C.F.R. Â§ 36.4307(a)(4)(i).
A borrower had to purchase additional points out of pocket to obtain the
advertised rate.

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the fees
or costs for loans offered or arranged to be offered.

Numerous Low VA Rates mailers misrepresented the amount of cash
actually available in connection with an advertised mortgage.

For example, Low VA Rates also sent 26,241 mailers to consumers between
January 1, 2016, and April 15, 2016, that promoted a âCASH refund from
current lender.â

In fact, that mailer failed to disclose both that (1) the cash refund would be
limited to the funds in the consumerâs escrow account and (2) the consumer
would be required to fund a new escrow account with Low VA Rates.
Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the

existence of cash available for loans offered or arranged to be offered.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent 26,241 mailers to consumers
between January 1, 2016 and April 15, 2016 that promoted âYOUR 1 Year
Savingsâ beside an estimated payment on the front of the ad.
In fact, the touted âsavingsâ were not as advertised and resulted from
deferring payments consumers would still ultimately be obligated to make.
Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the
existence of savings available for loans that it offered or would arrange to
offer.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 23-51
were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations

Related to Cost Comparisons

Some Low VA Rates advertisements contained misleading comparisons.
These advertisements misleadingly compared consumersâ actual or
hypothetical payments or rates with payments or simple-annual rates that
would be available under the advertised loan for a period less than the full
term of the loan and did not include a clear and conspicuous comparison to

the information required to be disclosed under Â§ 1026.24(f)(2) and (3), as

12
55.

56.

required by 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(2)(1).

For example, Low VA Rates sent 1,141,690 mailers between January 1,
2016, and September 16, 2016, that promoted a âfixed rate of... 1.75%,â as
well as included a statement that a âbetter interest rate has enabled our
clients to enjoy an Average Savings of--$294.00 / month on their home loans
in 2015, which is over $3,500/ year!â This constituted an implied
comparison between the advertised productâs payment and the consumerâs
current payment.

But the mailer fails to make the clear and conspicuous disclosures required
by Â§ 1026.24(f)(2) and (3).

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that stated that Low VA Rates
could reduce the interest rate on a consumerâs loan with an advertised rate
that was actually only in effect for the first three years of the 30-year loan
period without disclosing that introductory rate period. While the mailer
disclosed the full payment period in fine print on the back, the comparison
was made on the front.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 54â57

were likely to be misled by them.

60. Numerous Low VA Rates mailers contained misleading claims of debt
elimination.

61. For example, Low VA Rates sent 40,000 mailers between January 20, 2017,
and February 3, 2017, containing the following statements: â[f]reedom from
debt!â in the âFreedom from Debt Programâ via the âFreedom from Debt
VA Refinance.â An IRRRL or cash-out loan does not eliminate all of a
consumerâs debt but is instead itself a debt and, as a result, cannot be used to
âfreeâ a consumer of debt.

62. Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 60-61
were likely to be misled by them.

63. The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures

64. Most of Low VA Ratesâ mortgage advertisements stated a period of

repayment, payment amount, finance charge, or simple annual rate of

interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d),

and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements.
Some of the advertisements did not include the other disclosures that are
required, or did not include them in the manner required.

Numerous Low VA Rates advertisements stated the amount of a payment,
but failed to state: (a) the terms of repayment reflecting the consumerâs
repayment obligations over the full term of the loan and (b) the APR.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that stated a monthly $87.48
payment amount. The mailers did not state the terms of repayment reflecting
the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full term of the loan or the
APR.

Numerous Low VA Rates advertisements stated a simple annual rate of
interest for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply, but
failed to state an accurate APR for the loan under the accuracy standards set
forth in Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22; and/or failed to
state these terms clearly and conspicuously.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that prominently displayed a

2.25% introductory rate.

15
69.

70.

71.

72.

73.

74.

75.

The period for the introductory rate and the actual subsequent fully indexed
rate of 3.45% were only disclosed in fine print on the second page.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent advertisements for a variable rate
product described as a â2.25% hybrid (3.196% APRJ) |.â

The advertisement did not disclose the period for the introductory rate or any

subsequent rate for the loan product.

Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements stated the amount of an
initial payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would
apply over the term of the loan; failed to state the period during which each
payment would apply; or failed to state these terms clearly and
conspicuously.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that promoted a 30-year
variable-rate mortgage with a monthly payment of $573.37.

In fact, this payment was based only on the introductory rate. Low VA Rates
did not disclose each payment and the period for each payment that would
apply over the remaining term of the loan.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent 26,241 mailers to consumers
between January 1, 2016, and April 15, 2016, that disclosed someâbut not

allâmonthly payments clearly and conspicuously.

While the advertisements prominently disclosed initial monthly payments in
large print on the front of the advertisement, the required payment
information was only disclosed in a block of light gray small print on a

second page.

Some Low VA Rates mailers stated a simple annual interest rate more
conspicuously than the APR.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 138,200 mailers to consumers between
September 15, 2017, and November 24, 2017, that prominently mention a
â3%â simple annual interest rate five times, including twice mentioning rates
âbelow 3%.â

The advertisement stated this 3% rate without using the term âannual
percentage rate,â and while an APR is indicated in small print on the back of
the mailer, the statement of a simple annual percentage rate of 3% on the

front of the advertisement is more conspicuous.

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z
Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

80. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

81. Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs
23-51, numerous Low VA Rates advertisements for credit stated specific
credit terms other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged

or offered by the creditor.
Interest Rates Other than the APR, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c)

82. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c):

If an advertisement states a rate of finance charge, it shall state
the rate as an âannual percentage rate,â using that term. If the
annual percentage rate may be increased after consummation,
the advertisement shall state that fact.... If an advertisement
is for credit secured by a dwelling, the advertisement shall not
state any other rate [other than the APR], except that a simple
annual rate that is applied to an unpaid balance may be stated
in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the
[APR].

83. Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(c) because, as described in Paragraphs
77-79, numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements stated a simple

annual interest rate more conspicuously than the APR.

Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)ai).

Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs
65-66, numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements set forth the
period of repayment or the amount of any payment, which are triggering
terms under Â§ 1026.24(d)(1)(i1) and (iii), but failed to state the terms of

repayment over the full term of the loan pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)(ii).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1), if a direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.

In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

19
a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple
annual rate of interest will apply; and

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the

[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

87. Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in
Paragraphs 67-71, numerous Low VA Rates direct-mail mortgage
advertisements for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply
stated a simple annual rate of interest, but did not include one or more of the
disclosures required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1)(A) through (C), or did not

disclose them clearly and conspicuously, as defined in Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(ii).
Inadequate Disclosure of Payment Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i)

88. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be

disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien on a
dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts
for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the
actual payment obligation will be greater.

Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(1) because, as described in

Paragraphs 72-76, numerous Low VA Rates direct-mail mortgage

advertisements stated the amount of a payment but did not include one or

more of the disclosures required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)()(A) through

(C), or did not disclose them clearly and conspicuously, as defined in

Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(ii).

Misleading Cost Comparisons, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(2)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(2), mortgage advertisements may not:

Mak[e] any comparison .. . between actual or hypothetical credit
payments or rates and any payment or simple annual rate that will be
available under the advertised product for a period less than the full
term of the loan, unless:

(i)

(il)

In general. The advertisement includes a clear and conspicuous
comparison to the information required to be disclosed under Â§
1026.24(f)(2) and (3); and

Application to variable-rate transactions. If the advertisement is
for a variable-rate transaction, and the advertised payment or
simple annual rate is based on the index and margin that will be
used to make subsequent rate or payment adjustments over the
term of the loan, the advertisement includes an equally
prominent statement in close proximity to the payment or rate
that the payment or rate is subject to adjustment and the time
period when the first adjustment will occur.

Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(2) because, as described in Paragraphs
54-57, numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements contained a
comparison between actual or hypothetical payments or rates and a payment
or simple annual rate that would be available under the advertised loan for a
period less than the full term of the loan and did not comply with the
requirements of Â§ 1026.24(1)(2)Q) and (ii).

Misleading Claim of Debt Elimination, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(5)
Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(5), mortgage advertisements may not make
âany misleading claim... that the mortgage product offered will eliminate
debt or result in a waiver or forgiveness of a consumerâs existing loan terms

with, or obligations to, another creditor.â

Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(5) because, as described in Paragraphs
60â61, numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements misleadingly

indicated that the loan advertised would eliminate debt.

a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-59, Low VA Ratesâ
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available, would be offered, or arranged to be
offered including representations about specific APRs, payment amounts,
loan periods, available cash or credit, fees, cost comparisons, closing costs,
or the variable or fixed nature of rates or payments, when in fact those
specific credit terms were not available or were not the terms that Low VA
Rates was actually prepared to offer, or arranged to be offered.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised
credit terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Low VA Rates engaged in deceptive acts and practices in

violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Consumer Debt Elimination

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 60-63, Low VA Ratesâ

mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that debt

elimination was available, would be offered, or arranged to be offered
including representations about debt elimination, when in fact debt
elimination was not available or was not what Low VA Rates was actually
prepared to offer or arrange to be offered.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about debt elimination were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about the debt elimination in its
mortgage advertisements were material because they were likely to affect
the conduct or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Low VA Rates engaged in deceptive acts and practices in
violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 553 1(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule

Under the CFPA, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules
thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.

Low VA Ratesâ violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in
Paragraphs 80-103, constitute violations of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12

U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Advertising Review

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

120. Respondent, whether acting directly or indirectly, must take the following
affirmative actions:

a. Respondentâs Advertising Compliance Official must review each

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section V of this Consent Order, and taking
into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a
civil money penalty of $1,800,000 to the Bureau.
Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in
compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.
The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or

payment made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil

money penalty paid under this Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in any Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Enforcement
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that Respondent paid
or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Ninth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

OCT 26, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. -â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Low VA Rates LLC (Low VA Rates) to address the Bureauâs finding that
Low VA Rates sent consumers mailers for mortgage loans guaranteed by the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate
statements. Low VA Ratesâ conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices -
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. Low VA Rates, a Utah-based mortgage
lender and broker incorporated in Colorado and licensed in 48 states and DC, advertised
their VA-guaranteed loans through direct-mail primarily to U.S. military servicemembers and
veterans. The consent order requires Low VA Rates to pay a civil money penalty of
$1,800,000 to the Bureau and imposes requirements to prevent future violations. Today's
action is the ninth and last case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that used deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.
The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns raised by the VA about
potentially unlawful advertising in the mortgage lending market. The Bureau's response and
investigations reflect its commitment to enforcing the laws to ensure the financial
marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers, veterans, and
surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit. The Bureau
has obtained more than $4.4 million in civil money penalties as a result of this sweep.

The Bureau found that Low VA Ratesâ advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the
advertised mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually
prepared to offer to consumers, including misrepresenting the annual percentage rate
applicable to the advertised mortgage. Low VA Rates misrepresented the existence, nature,
or amount of cash or credit available to consumers, and used misleading rhetorical
questions, in connection with advertised mortgages. Low VA Rates advertisements also
failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit terms for the advertised
mortgage, such as the amount of each payment and time period of payments associated
with consumersâ repayment obligations over the full term of the loan. Low VA Ratesâ
advertisements also misleadingly indicated that its mortgage products could help
consumers eliminate debt. Finally, the Bureau found that Low VA Rates made misleading
comparisons involving actual or hypothetical loan terms in advertisements.

To prevent future violations, the consent order requires Low VA Rates to bolster its
compliance functions by designating an advertising compliance official who must review its
mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage advertising laws prior to use. The
consent order also prohibits Low VA Rates from making misrepresentations like those
identified by the Bureau through its investigation, and requires Low VA Rates to comply with
certain enhanced disclosure requirements

Respondentsâ Mississippi Auto-Title Pledge Product and Disclosures

Respondents offer auto-title loans to consumers in their Mississippi stores, which
are regulated under the Mississippi Title Pledge Act. Miss. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 75-67-
401 et seq.

Under Mississippi law, auto-title loans must be structured asa single-payment
transaction with a 30-day maturity date.

Mississippi law permits the parties to agree in writing to subsequent extensions
at 30-day intervals if the lender reduces the principal amount used to calculate
the finance charges by at least 10% of the original amount at each 30-day
extension. The full principal amount itself is still owed, but the finance charges
on that amount must be reduced.

Between October 2016 and August 2018, Respondents offered auto-title loans
which disclosed the finance charges, pursuant to TILA, based on a single-
payment transaction with a 30-day maturity date. Respondents also provided
consumers with a separate document entitled the âAmortization Schedule.â The
total of payments disclosed under TILA was substantially less than the amount
consumers would pay if they paid according to the 10-month Amortization
Schedule, and it was substantially less than the amount actually paid by most of

Respondentsâ consumers. Most consumers paid on their auto-title pledge
24.

25.

26.

27,

28.

transactions for longer than the 30-day period set forth in the TILA disclosures,
and thus paid more than the disclosed finance charge.

Respondents presented the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form containing
the 30-day finance charge and the Amortization Schedule showing 10 monthly
payments together to consumers.

Consumers were required to sign the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form,
which contained the principal amount of the loan and the âtitle pledge service
chargeâ for a single-payment transaction. These same terms were included in the
TILA disclosure asthe Amount Financed and the Finance Charge.

Respondents also required consumers to sign the Amortization Schedule. This
was the presumptive payment schedule for consumers under the contract.

A consumer who paid the 10 equal payments reflected on the Amortization
Schedule would ultimately pay significantly higher finance charges than the
finance charge that appeared in the TILA disclosure section of the Title Pledge
Agreement Transaction Form.

For example, on April 24, 2018, Respondents made a $500 loan to a consumer.
The Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form listed the amount financed as
$500, the finance charge as $119.50, and the total amount the consumer would
have paid after making all scheduled payments as $619.50. The number of
payments was listed as â1â and the due date listed as May 24, 2018, 30 days later.
The APR was listed as 290.78%. The consumer was required to sign this form. An
example of the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form is provided below as

Exhibit A.
29.

30.

31,

32,

33:

34.

The consumerâs total payments under the Amortization Schedule would be
$1,157.20, far more than the $619.50 disclosed in the TILA disclosure section of
the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form. An example of the Amortization
Schedule is provided below as Exhibit B.
Instead of paying $119.50 in finance charges as disclosed, the consumer would
have paid $657.20 in finance charges, the total of the monthly âfeeâ column in
this schedule when the consumer made payments in the scheduled amount each
month and did not redeem her title earlier.
Respondentsâ contracts and disclosures did not plainly indicate to consumers that
the finance charge and total amount paid under the 10-month Amortization
Schedule would be higher than those paid under the single-payment schedule.
From October 2016 through August 2018, Respondents provided documents
containing inaccurate TILA disclosures to their Mississippi title-loan consumers.
Misrepresentations of Finance Charges in Violation of the CFPA
Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or practices. 12 U.S.C.
Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).
As described in Paragraphs 20 to 32, when originating auto-title pledges in
Mississippi, Respondents disclosed to consumers, in the Title Pledge Transaction
Agreement Form, finance charges substantially lower than the consumers would
incur for their auto-title loans if they repaid them according to the Amortization

Schedules that Respondents also provided.
35:

36.

38.

39.

4O.

41.

Respondentsâ representations regarding finance charges were material because
they relate to the cost of the loan and would therefore likely affect the consumersâ
conduct or decision regarding the loan.
Respondentsâ representations were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably
under the circumstances. Consumers acting reasonably likely would not
understand that the Finance Charge and Total of Payments disclosed in the Title
Loan Agreement did not actually represent the amounts they would pay if they
paid according to the Amortization Schedule.
Respondentsâ representations set forth above were false or misleading and
constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 8Â§ 5531,
5536(a)(1)(B).

Understating of Finance Charges in Violation of TILA
Regulation Z implements TILA, 15 U.S.C. Â§8 1601â1666f, and is intended, among
other things, âto promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring
disclosures about its terms and cost.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.1.
Disclosures required by Regulation Z must be made âclearly and conspicuouslyâ
in writing and must reflect âthe terms of the legal obligation between the parties.â
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.17(a)(1), (c)(1).
Among other things, a creditor must disclose the âfinance chargeâ in a closed-end
credit transaction pursuant to TILA and Regulation Z. 15 U.S.C. 88 1631(b),
1638(a)(3); 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.18(d).
Regulation Z defines âfinance chargeâ as âthe cost of consumer credit asa dollar

amount.â The finance charge âincludes any charge payable directly or indirectly
42.

43.

44.

45.

46.

by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident
to or a condition of the extension of credit.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.4(a).

As described in Paragraphs 20 to 32 Respondents understated the finance charge
in its Mississippi auto-title pledge transactions. Respondentsâ failure to disclose a
finance charge that reflected the terms of the legal obligation between the parties,
which the Bureau found to be the Amortization Schedule, to a credit transaction
violated TILA and Regulation Z. 15 U.S.C. 88 1631(b), 1638(a)(3); 12 C.F.R.

Â§Â§ 1026.17(c)(1), 1026.18(d).

Respondentsâ Failure to Refund Consumersâ Credit Balances
Between October 2014 and November 2015, consumers sometimes made
overpayments to Respondents â that is, they may have inadvertently paid
Respondents more than they owed.

When they received overpayments from consumers, Respondents in many
instances retained them without contacting the consumers or issuing refunds for
extended periods, sometimes more than six months and in certain instances for
years.

While Respondents began refunding consumers these amounts in November

2015, they did not complete that process until November 2017.

Violations of the CFPA Related to Failure to Refund Credit Balances

An act or practice is unfair under the CFPA if it causes or is likely to cause
substantial injury to consumers, if the injury is not reasonably avoidable, and if
the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to

competition. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531(c).

Respondents injured consumers by keeping hundreds of consumersâ
overpayments, ranging from a few dollars to more than $500.

These injuries were not reasonably avoidable. Consumers were unaware that
Respondents would retain overpayments and most likely were unaware that they
had a credit balance with Respondents.

Finally, the injury is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers
or to competition. Respondentsâ failure to refund consumers provided no benefit
to consumers or to competition.

Respondentsâ failure to refund consumers credit balances was unfair, in violation
of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 88 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of TILA Related to Failure to Refund Credit Balances

TILA and Regulation Z require that, when a credit balance in excess of $1 is
created on a credit account, the creditor must â[m Jake a good faith effort to
refund the consumer. .. any part of the credit balance remaining in the account
for more than 6 months.â 12 C.F.R. 81026.21(c).

Respondentsâ failure to refund consumersâ credit balances in excess of $1 that had
been outstanding for more than six monthsis a violation of TILA and Regulation

Z. 12 C.F.R. 81026.21(c).

Respondentsâ Collection Calls to Consumersâ Workplaces and to References

53:

From October 2016 through at least January 2017, Respondents routinely called
consumers at work or called their references in an attempt to collect debts.
Sometimes Respondents called consumers on shared lines, and in the process,

spoke with consumersâ co-workers or employers. When Respondents spoke with

these third-parties, Respondents disclosed or risked disclosing the existence of
consumersâ debt.

Respondentsâ written company policy did not specifically limit calls to third
parties to circumstances where they could not reach the borrowers.

Respondentsâ written policy permitted daily calls to workplaces and references.
In practice, Respondentsâ often called consumersâ workplaces and references
twice daily.

Respondentsâ supervisors instructed employees to keep calling workplaces and
references until they spoke to someone.

Respondentsâ employees routinely called workplaces and references even when
they had accurate direct contact information for borrowers.

Respondentsâ employees received written warnings from company supervisors
for not calling workplaces and references enough.

When calling third parties, Respondentsâ employees in many instances disclosed
or risked disclosing the delinquency of consumersâ debts.

Respondentsâ employees also routinely called third parties, including consumersâ
workplaces and references, after they had been asked to stop calling these phone
numbers.

Respondents made numerous calls to workplaces when (a) Respondents knew or
should have known that such calls were prohibited or (b) Respondents knew or
should have known that the consumers, their colleagues, or employers had

previously requested that the calls to work cease.

When calling workplaces, references or other third parties in its collection efforts,
Respondentsâ employees in many instances disclosed or risked disclosing the
delinquency of consumersâ debts.
Consumers suffered or were likely to suffer harm asa result of these collection
callpractices, including humiliation, reputational damage, and negative
consequences at work.

Violations of the CFPA Related to Collection Calls
Respondentsâ repeated calls to third parties have caused and were likely to cause
consumers substantial injury, including humiliation, inconvenience, and
reputational damage ranging from unwanted attention, to disclosure of their
delinquent debt to references or colleagues, to disciplinary action and other
negative employment consequences at work.
Consumers could not reasonably avoid the harm because they did not know
whether, when, or how these calls might occur and had no control over
Respondentsâ use of these collection tactics. In numerous instances, Respondents
continued to call consumers references and at work even after consumers,
references, or their employers asked Respondents to stop. This injury was not
outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.
Respondentsâ repeated calls to consumersâ workplaces and references were made
without regard to whether Respondents could reach consumers directly and in
many instances after consumers had requested that Respondents cease

attempting to contact them.

Respondents, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under this
Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how the

offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary remedies
imposed against Respondents based on the civil money penalty paid in this action
or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund,
Respondents must, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset
or reduction, notify the Bureau and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Short-term Lenders for
Engaging in Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices

JUN 02, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau)
announced a settlement with Main Street Personal Finance, Inc. and its subsidiaries-ACAC,
Inc., which conducts business under the name Approved Cash Advance, and Quik Lend,
Inc.-(collectively, Approved Cash). The companies, which are based in Cleveland,
Tennessee, offer payday and auto-title loans and own and operate about 156 stores in eight
different states: Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Tennessee, and Virginia. The Bureau found that Approved Cash provided deceptive finance
charge disclosures in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) and the
Truth in Lending Act (TILA), violated the CFPA and TILA by failing to refund overpayments

on its loans, and violated the CFPA by engaging in unfair debt collection practices. The
consent order prohibits Approved Cash from engaging in this unlawful conduct in the
future and requires it to pay consumer redress and a civil money penalty.

Specifically, the Bureau found that Approved Cash violated the CFPAâs prohibition against
engaging in deceptive acts or practices and TILA by concealing and understating the actual
finance charges of its auto-title loans, which are called auto-title pledge transactions under
Mississippi state law, for over 4,000 consumers. Consumers paid a total of over $3.5 million
more than the finance charge listed in Approved Cash's loan disclosures. The Bureau also
found that Approved Cash violated the CFPAâs prohibition against unfair acts or practices
and TILA by retaining consumersâ overpayments on their loans for months and sometimes
years instead of returning those funds to consumers. The Bureau also found that Approved
Cash engaged in unfair debt collection practices in violation of the CFPA when it made
numerous calls to consumersâ workplaces, references, and other third parties after being
asked to stop, and improperly disclosed consumersâ debts to third parties or used tactics
that risked such disclosure.

The consent order imposes a judgment against Approved Cash of approximately $3.5
million in consumer redress, which amount is suspended upon its payment of $2 million of
that judgment and $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau based on Approved Cash's
demonstrated inability to pay. Whenever the Bureau collects a civil money penalty through
an enforcement action, that penalty is deposited into the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund.
Assuming continued available funds, the Bureau will work to provide full relief to eligible
harmed consumers from this fund. The consent order also prohibits Approved Cash from
misrepresenting finance charges in its auto-title pledge transactions, requires it to ensure
that consumers with credit balances over $1 are refunded timely, and prohibits it from
engaging in the same unlawful debt collections practices.

The consent order issued against Approved Cash is available at:

34. Settling Defendants and Relief Defendants relinquish all dominion,
control, title to the funds paid under this Order to the fullest extent permitted by
law. No part of the funds may be returned to Settling Defendants or Relief
Defendants.

35. The facts alleged in the Complaint will be taken as true and be
given collateral estoppel effect, without further proof, in any proceeding based
on the entry of the Order, or in any subsequent civil litigation by, or on behalf
of the Bureau, including in a proceeding to enforce its rights to any payment or
monetary judgment under this Order, such as a nondischargeability complaint in
any bankruptcy case.

36. The facts alleged in the Complaint establish all elements necessary
to sustain an action by the Bureau under to Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§ 523(a)(2)(A). For such purposes, this Order will
have collateral estoppel effect against each Settling Defendant, even in such

Defendants, unless they already have done so, must furnish to the Bureau their

Defendants and Relief Defendants may not argue that any Settling Defendant or
Relief Defendant is entitled to, nor may any Settling Defendant or Relief
Defendant benefit by, any offset or reduction of any monetary remedies
imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the civil money penalties
paid in this action, or because of any payment that the Bureau makes from the

otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary remedies imposed
against any Settling Defendant and Relief Defendant based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action, or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, such Settling Defendant or Relief Defendant must,
within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction,
notify the Bureau and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S.

Protection Bureau

 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Monster Loans, Thomas Chou,
Sean Cowell, and Related Companies

MAY 14, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
proposed stipulated final judgment to resolve its allegations in its lawsuit against California
mortgage lender Chou Team Realty, LLC, which does business as Monster Loans (Monster
Loans), and several individuals and related companies, including Thomas Chou and Sean
Cowell. The Bureau alleged that Chou and Cowell were among the leaders of a scheme to
use Monster Loansâ account with a major credit bureau to unlawfully obtain consumer
reports for their associated student loan debt-relief companies, which in turn used the
consumer reports to deceptively market their services nationwide and then charged
consumers illegal fees. The proposed settlement, if entered by the court, would impose an
$18 million redress judgment against Monster Loans, ban Monster Loans, Chou, and Cowell
from the debt-relief industry, and impose a total $450,001 civil money penalty against them.

The Bureauâs lawsuit alleged that between 2015 and 2017, Monster Loans violated the Fair
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) by obtaining consumer-report information for over 7 million
consumers with student loan debt from a major credit bureau based on the false
representation that the company would use the information to offer mortgage loans to
consumers. Monster Loans allegedly provided the reports to several associated student
loan debt-relief companies to use in marketing their services. The Bureau also alleged that
in 2017 Monster Loans helped create a sham entity called Lend Tech Loans to perpetuate
the scheme to unlawfully obtain consumer reports: Lend Tech Loans purported to be a
mortgage brokerage, but in fact has only ever been used to unlawfully obtain consumer
report information. As alleged in the complaint, because of Monster Loansâ assistance, Lend
Tech Loans was able to wrongfully obtain consumer reports for over 12 million additional
consumers between 2017 and 2019. The Bureau further alleged that, with Monster Loansâ
assistance, the student loan debt-relief companies violated the Consumer Financial
Protection Act (CFPA) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) by making several deceptive
representations about the companiesâ services and violated the TSR by unlawfully collecting
advance fees for debt relief services.

Chou and Cowell were officers of Monster Loans, investors in the student-loan debt relief
companies, and allegedly helped create the sham entity Lend Tech Loans. The Bureau
alleged that they participated in the FCRA violations and then received purported profits
from the student-loan debt-relief companies. As alleged in the complaint, in reality, those
profits represented funds that were wrongfully taken from consumers through unlawful
conduct. If the court approves the proposed settlement, Monster Loans, Chou, and Cowell
will be permanently banned from the debt-relief services industry and subject to limits on
using or obtaining consumer reports, including a ban from using or obtaining prescreened
consumer reports.

If entered by the court, the proposed settlement will also impose a judgment for redress of
$18 million against Monster Loans. As explained in the proposed order, full payment of the
judgment for redress will be suspended subject to Monster Loansâ payment of $200,000 for
consumer redress. The settlement will also require Chou and his company to disgorge
$403,750 in profits for the purpose of providing redress and will impose a judgment for
redress of $406,150 against Cowell and his company, which will be suspended. These
suspended amounts account for certain of these defendantsâ limited ability to pay more
based on sworn financial statements. If the court enters the proposed settlement, Monster
Loans will pay a $1 civil penalty based on its documented inability to pay, Chou will pay a
$350,000 penalty, and Cowell will pay a $100,000 penalty. The penalties will be paid to the
Bureau and deposited in the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund.

The Bureauâs claims against the other defendants and relief defendants in this action,
including Lend Tech Loans, remain pending in the court.

Bureau of Consumer Financial
Protection,

Plaintiff,
V.

My Loan Doctor LLC d/b/a Loan
Doctor and Edgar Radjabli,

Defendants.

 

 

COMPLAINT

CASE NO.

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) brings this action

against My Loan Doctor LLC d/b/a Loan Doctor (Loan Doctor) and Edgar Radjabli

and alleges as follows.

INTRODUCTION

1. The Bureau brings this action against Loan Doctor and Radjabli under

Â§ 1054 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) to address

deceptive acts or practices in connection with offering consumers a âcertificate of

depositâ (CD), purportedly created to generate capital for Loan Doctorâs healthcare-

loan-origination business.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction because this action is
âbrought under Federal consumer financial law,â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(a)(1), presents a
federal question, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and is brought by an agency of the United
States, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345.

3. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because the
causes of action arise from Defendantsâ conduct in this district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).

4. Venue is proper in this district because Defendants have done business

in this district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).

PARTIES

5. The Bureau is an agency of the United States charged with regulating
the offering and provision of consumer-financial products and services under
âFederal consumer financial laws,â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5491(a), including the CFPA, 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(14). The Bureau has independent litigating authority, including the
authority to enforce the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(a), (b).

6. Loan Doctor is a Delaware financial-services company operating in
West Palm Beach, Florida, and New York, New York.

7. Because Loan Doctor is a company, it is a âpersonâ as that term is
defined in the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(19).

8. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Loan Doctor has been a
âcovered personâ under the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A), because it âengages in

offering or providing a consumer financial product or service.â The CFPA defines
âconsumer financial product or serviceâ to include âengaging in deposit-taking
activities ... or otherwise acting as a custodian of funds . . . for use by or on behalf
of a consumerâ for personal, family, or household purposes. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5),
(15)(A)Gv). Loan Doctor offers to accept deposits from consumers and to act as a
custodian of those funds for use by consumers for personal, family, or household
purposes.

9. Radjabli is a ârelated personâ under the CFPA, 12 U.S.C.
Â§ 5481(25)(C)G), because he was an officer of Loan Doctor and was charged with
managerial responsibility for Loan Doctor.

10. Asarelated person, Radjabli is liable because he is deemed to be a
âcovered personâ under the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B), and because he has
engaged in the deceptive acts and practices described below, in violation of

Â§ 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

FACTS
11.  Radjabli founded Loan Doctor in July 2019 with the following business
plan: Loan Doctor would originate loans for healthcare professionals wanting to
purchase or start a new practice; Loan Doctor would then immediately sell those
loans for a profit to pre-committed secondary investors.
12. To purportedly fund these loans before selling them to buyers, in
August 2019, Loan Doctor began offering consumers what it dubbed a âHealthcare

Finance (HCF) Savings CD Account,â or an âHCF High Yield CD Account,â
featuring what Loan Doctor referred to in its advertising as âthe highest return of
any savings product in the US at 6% APY.â

13. The minimum deposit required from a consumer to open an âHCF High
Yield CD Accountâ was $1,000.

14. Loan Doctor advertised that any deposit made by a consumer would
result in the purchase of a CD that matured monthly and could be withdrawn, with
interest, with one monthâs notice.

15. Loan Doctor marketed its HCF High Yield CD Account through a
variety of media: its website, targeted Facebook and Google advertisements, press
releases, emails to individuals who had expressed interest, and emails to registered
investment advisors. Radjabli wrote or edited most of the content for Loan Doctor's
website and marketing materials.

16. Starting in August 2019, Loan Doctor took more than $15 million from
at least 400 consumers who opened and deposited money into an HCF High Yield
CD Account.

17. Inits marketing materials, including on its website, Loan Doctor made
false and inconsistent representations about both its business model and the
stability of the funds deposited in its CDs.

18. Specifically, Loan Doctor:

a. falsely represented that it used the money deposited in its HCF

High Yield CD Accounts to originate loans for healthcare professionals
and that it always had a buyer lined up for the loans before each loanâs
origination;

b. falsely represented that, to the extent that money deposited in
one of its HCF High Yield CD Accounts was not being used to originate
loans, the money would be held in one of the following locationsâan
FDIC-insured account, a Lloydâs of London-insured account, or a âcash
alternativeâ or âcash equivalentâ account;

C. falsely touted the stability of its HCF High Yield CD Accounts
by likening those accounts to various types of savings accounts and
falsely describing itself as a âcommercial bankâ; and
d. falsely represented past returns on its HCF High Yield CD
Accounts.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate

Representations that Loan Doctor Would Use Consumersâ Money

to Originate Loans for Resale to Pre-Committed Secondary Investors

19. Loan Doctor claimed that the money deposited in its HCF High Yield
CD Accounts would be used to originate loans for healthcare professionals.

20. According to its website, â[s]imilar to a bank, the funds deposited in
the account allow Loan Doctor to fund healthcare lending needs during very short
time periods, before the originated loans are securitized and sold to large
institutional investors.â

21. Loan Doctor further claimed that whenever it originated such a loan, it

already had an investor lined up to purchase that loan.
22. Specifically, Loan Doctorâs website stated that â[w]hen loans are
originated, Loan Doctor always has a securitization buyer/investor available.â

23. Loan Doctorâs website also stated that, â[u]nlike a bank which must
account for defaults on the loans it issues, Loan Doctorâs ability to immediately
resell the loans ensures that it is not exposed to defaults.â

24. Loan Doctorâs website further explained that in the current market,
there is a âtremendous appetite for highly performing loans such as those made to
healthcare professionals,â and âLoan Doctor therefore has only short term financing
needs to help generate new lending activity to its high credit grade healthcare
clients, as it is guaranteed to resell the debt within the 1 month term of the CD.â

25. In addition, Loan Doctorâs website made the claim: âThe Loan Doctor
team has helped over 3500 doctors nationwide, originating over $500MM in loans.â

26. Finally, Loan Doctorâs website also referred to its âtrusted lending
partnersâ and then listed specific banksâ names.

27. But Loan Doctor never used the money invested in its HCF High Yield
CD Accounts to originate loans for healthcare professionals.

28. In fact, Loan Doctor never originated a loan for a healthcare
professional.

29. Loan Doctor never sold a loan to a bank or secondary-market investor.

30. Loan Doctor never entered into any contracts to sell at a future date to

buyers or investors a loan that it originated.
Ol.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
about the Location and Safety of Consumersâ Deposits

Loan Doctorâs website contained a detailed FAQ section that was

dedicated to explaining how Loan Doctorâs business operated and was designed to

reassure consumers as to the safety of their deposits.

o2.

Loan Doctor specifically stated that, when not being used to originate

healthcare loans, consumersâ âidleâ money would be held in one of the following

places:

Oo.

a. âDuring the times that the funds are idle, they are invested in
FDIC insured cash and cash equivalents with our banking partners,
where they also earn interestâ;

b. âThe funds in the CD account are deposited at either US banks
where they are covered by FDIC insurance, or in the case of cash
alternatives, by Lloydâs of London up to $100MMâ; and

C. âLoan Doctor maintains a cash reserve equivalent to the amount
on deposit, therefore each account is 100% fully collateralized with
cash/cash alternatives.â

In fact, most of the money that consumers deposited with Loan Doctor

was not held in the types of accounts described on Loan Doctorâs website. Instead,

money that consumers deposited with Loan Doctor was placed in a hedge fund

owned by Radjabli and then invested in securities, or it was invested with a

securities broker-dealer that offered individuals high-interest loans backed by those

individualsâ stock holdings.
34. Until February 2020, Loan Doctor invested between $100,000 and
$200,000 of consumersâ deposits in a fintech company that claimed on its website to
have been insured by a $100 million policy from Lloydâs of London. But Loan Doctor
ceased investing in the fintech company in February 2020 and later transferred the
money to one of its other investment locations.

35. Additionally, Loan Doctor was not capitalized by any source apart from
consumers who made cash deposits into its HCF High Yield CD Accounts, rendering
false the statement that âLoan Doctor maintains a cash reserve equivalent to the
amount on deposit.â

36. Loan Doctor concealed its true business model from consumers.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations that Loan Doctorâs
HCF High Yield CD Accounts were Comparable to a Bank Savings Account

37. Loan Doctor made several claims that compared its HCF High Yield
CD Accounts to a traditional savings account with a guaranteed return, when, in
fact, Loan Doctor invested most of the consumersâ money in volatile securities or
securities-backed investments. Specifically, Loan Doctor claimed or implied that its
HCF High Yield CD Accounts:

a. provided a âshort term savings option for clients looking for a
stable, guaranteed and predictable interest income, comparable to a
traditional bank savings account or CDâ;

b. had â[t]he highest return of any savings product in the US at 6%

APYâ;
Case P:20-cv-05159 Docum | ed O7/O6/20 Page 9 of 5
C. provided a guaranteed return, asking in a Facebook

advertisement, âHey Mom and Dad, Are you getting a Guaranteed 6%
APY on my college fund?â;
d. mimicked a bank CD, comparing Loan Doctorâs structure to
âFractional Reserve Bankingâ and stating: âHow does the HCF High
Yield CD Account Earn Interest? Similar to a bank, the funds
deposited in the account allow Loan Doctor to fund healthcare lending
needs during very short time periods, before the originated loans are
securitized and sold to large institutional investorsâ; and
e. functioned like a bank CD, stating: âCan the interest rate
change? Yes, just like any bank savings or CD account, the HCF High
Yield CD account interest rate could rise or fall, depending on market
conditions, such as the federal rate or healthcare lending
environment.â

38. In fact, each representation described in paragraph 37 was false.

39. Loan Doctorâs Facebook page explicitly stated that it was a

âCommercial Bank.â
40. Loan Doctor was not a commercial bank.
41. The money that consumers deposited with Loan Doctor was actively

traded in the stock market or used to make stock-backed loans.
False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
about Past Performance of its HCF High Yield CD Accounts

42. Loan Doctorâs Facebook page stated that, for the HCF High Yield CD
Accounts it offered, âthe principal is guaranteed and insured. The interest is not,
but we have paid 6% through all of 2019 and 5% to 6.25% in years prior.â

43. In fact, Loan Doctor only began offering its CD in August 2019, and

consumersâ principal was neither guaranteed nor insured.

Defendantsâ Post-Investigation Conduct

44. On March 20, 2020, the Bureau requested that Loan Doctor cease
offering its High Yield CD product to consumers and remove all marketing of the
CD product from its website.

45. On March 26, 2020, Loan Doctor partially heeded the Bureauâs
request, removing all new offerings of its CD product from its website. But Loan
Doctor did not cease operating.

AG. Instead, Radjabli contacted several financial advisors in an effort to
continue to sell Loan Doctorâs High Yield CD product under a different name while
still concealing its risks to consumers.

47. Inemails to those advisors, Radjabli made no mention of the Bureauâs
request that Loan Doctor cease offering and marketing its CD product and stop
taking any new deposits from consumers. Rather, Radjabli explained: âOur lending
partners (who are big banks, mostly) have decided they do not like that we have a

CD program because it competes with the savings products they offer. ... So weâve

10
been basically given an ultimatum... which is: donât advertise/call it a CD or they
will not work with us on the lending side... . [T]he investment has to be called
something that does not resemble a banking product.â

48.  Radjabli sought the advisorsâ help to find a name for Loan Doctor's
product âthat conveys the security, predictable income, imperviousness to stock

market volatility etc of the product but without sounding like a bank product.â

VIOLATIONS OF LAW

49. Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person to engage ina
deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a
consumer-financial product or service or the offering of a consumer-financial
product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

50. A practice is deceptive if (1) there is a representation or omission of
information that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances and (2) that information is material to consumers.

COUNT 1
Deceptive Representations about Healthcare Lending

51. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-50.

52. Defendants represented that the money consumers deposited in HCF
High Yield CD Accounts would be used to originate loans for healthcare
professionals and that, at the time Loan Doctor would originate such a loan, it

would already have an investor lined up to purchase that loan.

11
53. In fact, these representations were false because Defendants never
used the money consumers deposited into HCF High Yield CD Accounts to originate
loans for healthcare professionals, nor did Defendants enter into a contract with
any buyer or investor to purchase a loan.

54. Defendantsâ misrepresentations were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

55. Defendantsâ misrepresentations were material because they were
likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers regarding whether to deposit
money into the HCF High Yield CD Accounts.

56. Therefore, Defendants engaged in deceptive acts or practices, in
violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

COUNT 2
Deceptive Representations about
the Location of Consumersâ Deposits

57. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-50.

58. Defendants represented that the money consumers deposited into HCF
High Yield CD Accounts, when not being used to originate loans, would be held in
an FDIC-insured account, an account that is insured by Lloydâs of London, or a
âcash alternativeâ or âcash equivalent.â

59. Defendants represented that Loan Doctor maintained a cash reserve in

an amount âequivalent toâ the money that consumers had deposited.

12
60. In fact, these representations were false because consumersâ funds
were primarily invested in actively traded securities or loaned, through a third
party, to investors using their individual-stock portfolios as collateral.

61. Defendantsâ misrepresentations were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

62. Defendantsâ misrepresentations were material because they were
likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers regarding whether to deposit
money in the HCF High Yield CD Accounts.

63. Therefore, Defendants engaged in deceptive acts or practices, in
violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

COUNT 3
Deceptive Representations Comparing

Loan Doctorâs HCF High Yield CD Account to a Savings Account

64. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-50.

65. Defendants represented that Loan Doctor was a commercial bank.

66. In fact, Loan Doctor was not a commercial bank.

67. Defendants represented that money deposited in Loan Doctorâs HCF
High Yield CD Accounts was safe and that the HCF High Yield CD Accounts were
comparable to a traditional savings account with a guaranteed return.

68. In fact, these representations were false because Defendants invested
consumersâ money in volatile securities or securities-backed investments.

69. Defendantsâ misrepresentations were likely to mislead consumers

acting reasonably under the circumstances.

13
70. Defendantsâ misrepresentations were material because they were
likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers regarding whether to deposit
money in Loan Doctorâs HCF High Yield CD Accounts.

71. Defendants therefore engaged in deceptive acts or practices, in
violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

COUNT 4
Deceptive Representations about Past Performance

72. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-50.

73. Defendantsâ Facebook page stated that in years before 2019, the HCF
High Yield CD Accounts paid interest at rates between 5% and 6.25%.

74. â In fact, this representation was false, as Loan Doctor did not offer its
HCF High Yield CD Accounts before August 2019.

75. Defendantsâ misrepresentation was likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

76. Defendantsâ misrepresentation was material because the past
performance of the HCF High Yield CD Accounts was likely to affect the conduct or
decision of consumers regarding whether to deposit money in those accounts.

77. Defendants therefore engaged in deceptive acts or practices, in

violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

DEMAND FOR RELIEF

The Bureau requests that the Court, as permitted by 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565:

a. enjoin Defendants from committing future violations of the CFPA;

14
Case 1:20-cv-05159 Document1 Filed 07/06/20 Page 15 of 15

b. award damages or other monetary relief against Defendants;
C. order Defendants to pay redress to consumers;

d. order disgorgement of Defendantsâ ill-gotten gains;

e. impose civil money penalties on Defendants;

f. order Defendants to pay the costs incurred in connection with

prosecuting this action; and

go, award additional relief as the Court may determine to be just and

proper.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Files Suit Against Loan Doctor and Edgar
Radjabli for Deceptive Acts and Practices in Marketing a Savings CD Account

JUL 06, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
lawsuit against My Loan Doctor LLC, a Delaware financial-services company operating in
West Palm Beach, Florida and New York City and doing business as Loan Doctor (Loan
Doctor), and its founder, Edgar Radjabli. The Bureau alleges that Loan Doctor and Radjabli
made several false, misleading, and inaccurate marketing representations in advertising
Loan Doctor's âHealthcare Finance (HCF) Savings CD Account,â in violation of the Consumer
Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. As the
Bureau's complaint alleges, starting in August 2019, Loan Doctor took more than $15
million from at least 400 consumers who opened and deposited money into Loan Doctor's
deceptively advertised product.

The Bureauâs complaint, filed in federal district court in the Southern District of New York,
specifically alleges that Loan Doctor and Radjabli engaged in four separate deceptive acts
or practices in violation of the CFPA.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that the money consumers deposited into
Loan Doctor's HCF High Yield CD Accounts would be used to originate loans for healthcare
professionals and that Loan Doctor, before making a loan, would have an investor lined up
to purchase it after it was made; in fact, Loan Doctor never used the deposits to originate
loans for healthcare professionals and never entered into a contract with a buyer or investor
to purchase a loan.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that the money consumers deposited into
Loan Doctor's HCF High Yield CD Accounts, when not being used to originate loans, would
be held in an FDIC-insured account, an account insured by Lloydâs of London, or a âcash
alternativeâ or âcash equivalent,â and, further, that Loan Doctor would maintain a cash
reserve in an amount âequivalent toâ the amount consumers deposited; in fact, consumersâ
deposits were invested in actively traded securities or loaned, through a third party, to
investors using individual stock portfolios as collateral.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that Loan Doctor was a commercial bank and
that consumersâ deposits were safe and comparable to a traditional savings account with a
guaranteed return; in fact, Loan Doctor was not a commercial bank, and consumersâ
deposits were invested in volatile securities or securities-backed investments.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that Loan Doctor's HCF High Yield CD
Accounts paid interest at rates between 5 percent and 6.25 percent in the years before
2019; in fact, Loan Doctor did not even begin taking consumer deposits until August 2019.

The Bureau seeks redress for consumers, an injunction, and the imposition of civil money
penalties.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

New York is available here: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_loan-

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Multiple States Enter into Settlement
with Nationstar Mortgage, LLC for Unlawful Servicing Practices

DEC 07, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
complaint and proposed stipulated judgment and order against Nationstar Mortgage, LLC,
which does business as Mr. Cooper (Nationstar). The Bureauâs action is part of a
coordinated effort between the Bureau, a multistate group of state attorneys general, and
state bank regulators. The Bureau alleges that Nationstar violated multiple Federal
consumer financial laws, causing substantial harm to the borrowers whose mortgage loans it
serviced, including distressed homeowners. Nationstar is one of the nationâs largest
mortgage servicers and the largest non-bank mortgage servicer in the United States. The
proposed judgment and order, if entered by the court, would require Nationstar to pay
approximately $73 million in redress to more than 40,000 harmed borrowers. It would also
require Nationstar to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty to the Bureau. Attorneys general from
all 50 states and the District of Columbia and bank regulators from 53 jurisdictions covering
48 states and Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia have also settled
with Nationstar today and their settlements are reflected in separate actions, concurrently
filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

âMortgage servicers are entrusted with handling significant financial transactions for millions
of Americans, including struggling homeowners. Nationstar broke that trust by engaging in
unfair and deceptive practices prohibited by the Consumer Financial Protection Act of

2010, as well as violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the
Homeowner's Protection Act,â said CFPB Director Kathleen L. Kraninger. âToday's action is
the culmination of a multi-year effort working with our state partners to investigate
Nationstarâs failings, which resulted in substantial consumer harm. We had a strong
partnership with our state counterparts in this case and | thank them for all their support in
this case.â

âThis settlement demonstrates the crucial role of state financial services regulators in
ensuring that homeowners are protected as they obtain and pay down their mortgagesâ
especially homeowners who may be struggling with making their payments,â said Illinois
Department of Financial and Professional Regulation Secretary Deborah Hagan. âThis
resolution demonstrates that a commitment to government coordination provides a path to
efficient, effective, and comprehensive outcomes for both consumers and for Mr. Cooper,
who will be held to the highest operational standards as it continues to provide mortgage
services across the nation.â

The Bureauâs and Statesâ proposed judgments and orders, if entered by the court, will yield
nearly $85 million in recoveries for consumers to date and over $6 million more in fees and
penalties. They are also part of a larger government effort, which also includes assistance
from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) and
the United States Trustee Program, to address Nationstarâs alleged unlawful mortgage loan
servicing practices.

In its complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, the Bureau alleges
that Nationstar engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act (RESPA), and violated the Homeowner's Protection Act of 1998 (HPA). Specifically, the
Bureau alleges that between January 2012 and January 1, 2016, in numerous instances
Nationstar failed to identify loans on its systems that had pending loss-mitigation
applications or trial-modification plans, and as a result failed to honor borrowersâ loan
modification agreements. Nationstar allegedly foreclosed on borrowers to whom it had
promised it would not foreclose while their loss mitigation applications were pending.
Nationstar also allegedly improperly increased borrowersâ permanent, modified monthly
loan payments, mispresented to borrowers when they would be eligible to have their
private mortgage insurance premiums canceled, and failed to timely remove private
mortgage insurance from borrowersâ accounts. Nationstar allegedly failed to timely disburse
borrowersâ tax payments from their escrow accounts and failed to properly conduct escrow
analyses for borrowers during their Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.

If entered by the court, Nationstar would be required to immediately set aside about $15.6
million to pay borrowers it has not remediated prior to the order's effective date and to
certify that it has already paid approximately $57.5 million in redress to other borrowers
affected by the conduct alleged in the complaint. The stipulated judgment and order would
also require Nationstar, among other things, to enhance its policies and processes including
with respect to handling consumer complaints and disputes, conducting escrow analyses
on borrowersâ accounts, transferring information during servicing transfers, offering loss
mitigation, and terminating borrowersâ private mortgage insurance.

In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed
repossession and servicing activities by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation
(Respondent, as defined below) and has identified the following law violations:
(1) Respondent wrongfully repossessed some vehicles despite having agreements
in place with consumers to prevent repossession; (2) Respondent, through
repossession agents, kept personal property that was located in consumersâ
vehicles at the time of repossession and would not return that personal property
until consumers paid a fee for its storage; (3) Respondent, through its service
provider, deprived consumers making auto-loan payments by phone of the ability

to select a payment option with a significantly lower fee than the one they were

charged; and (4) Respondent made a deceptive statement in its agreements to
extend consumersâ auto loans that appeared to limit consumersâ bankruptcy
protections. These actions violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536. Under Sections 1053 and 1055 of the Consumer

had been made, a repossession will not be deemed a Wrongful
Repossession under this Consent Order if it occurred less than one
business day after the consumerâs payment was made. Finally,
where a consumer made a payment described in subpart 3.1.b(1) or
3.1.b(i11) through a channel other than Respondentâs online

IV
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
Respondent is an auto financing subsidiary of Nissan North America, Inc.
that services loans and leases.
Nissan and Infiniti dealerships nationwide originate and then assign the

loans and leases to Respondent.

Respondentâs auto loan servicing operations are based in Irving, Texas.
NMAC services millions of Accounts, representing billions of dollars in
outstanding principal. In 2018, dealerships assigned NMAC over 382,000
new loans and 299,000 new leases. That same year, NMAC serviced
$49.3 billion in outstanding loans and leases.
Respondent is a âcovered personâ under the CFPA because it is in the
business of servicing Accounts. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), (15)(A)Q@).
Findings and Conclusions as to Unfair Acts or Practices

Sections 1031 and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531,
5536(a)(1)(B), prohibits covered persons from engaging âin any unfair,
deceptive, or abusive act or practice.â
An act or practice is unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial
injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers and that
is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531(c)(1).

Respondent Wrongfully Repossessed Consumersâ Vehicles
When NMAC consumers miss Account payments, Respondent asks them
to make a promise to pay by a certain date, or to enter into an agreement to

extend their loan, known as an extension agreement, to avoid repossession.

Respondent periodically attempts to contact consumers concerning missed
payments from the time consumers miss the first payment until the vehicle
is repossessed.

From 2013 through at least 2018, Respondentâs policy was not to refer an
Account for repossession when the consumer had an active promise to
payâmeaning the consumer had made a promise to pay by a date that had
not yet passedâor had recently entered an extension agreement to resolve
the consumerâs delinquency.

Respondent informed consumers that it would not repossess their vehicles
if the consumers paid to decrease their delinquency to under 60 days past
due, kept a promise to pay, or entered into an extension agreement.
Respondent also informed consumers that it would not repossess vehicles
if the consumersâ payments were less than 60 days past due.

From 2013 through September of 2019, Respondent repossessed the
vehicles of hundreds of consumers who had: (1) made payments that
decreased their delinquency to less than 60 days past due; (11) made and
kept promises to pay; (iii) made promises to pay by a future date that had
not yet passed; or (iv) agreed to extension agreements with Respondent.
Each of these actions taken by consumers should have prevented

repossessions.

As aresult of Respondentâs Wrongful Repossessions consumers lost the
use of their vehicles. Many also experienced other consequences, such as
missed work, expenses for alternative transportation, repossession-related
fees, detrimental credit reporting, and vehicle damage in the repossession
process.

Respondentâs Wrongful Repossessions caused or were likely to cause
substantial injury to consumers that was not reasonably avoidable or
outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.
Thus, Respondent engaged in unfair acts and practices, in violation of the

CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondent, Through its Repossession Agents, Engaged in Unfair Acts and

20.

21.

22.

Practices by Withholding Consumersâ Personal Belongings Until the

Consumers Paid an Upfront Fee
Respondent contracts with ârepossession forwardersâ to manage
repossessions of consumersâ vehicles on behalf of NMAC.
After Respondent identifies a vehicle for repossession, Respondent assigns
it to a repossession forwarder to manage the process.
Respondentâs repossession forwarders then assign Respondentâs
repossessions to repossession agents, who pick up consumersâ vehicles on

behalf of Respondent.
23.

24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

Respondent provides information to the repossession forwarders indicating
that a vehicle should be repossessed.

Respondent does not advise its consumers the date or time when a
repossession will occur.

After repossessions occur, Respondent sends communications to
consumers whose vehicles have been repossessed indicating that the
repossession has occurred and noting what consumers will have to pay to
recover their vehicles.

Consumersâ vehicles in many instances contain the consumersâ personal
property. Consumers reported that ttems such as childrenâs car seats,
college textbooks, and prescription sunglasses were in their vehicles when
the vehicles were repossessed.

From at least early 2014 through late August 2017, Respondentâs
repossession agents in many instances imposed fees on consumers for
holding personal property contained in repossessed vehicles. These
repossession agents often refused to return consumersâ personal property
unless and until the consumers paid the fees.

Respondent knew that its repossession agents often refused to return
consumersâ personal property until after the consumers paid the upfront

fees.

Respondent represented to some consumers that it had no control over the
fees repossession agents charged, but in some instances Respondent
directed repossession forwarders to have repossession agents lower the
fees charged to consumers.

Some consumers whose vehicles were repossessed could not recover their
personal property because they did not pay the fees. Others were denied
access to their personal property until they paid the upfront fees.

The practice of withholding consumersâ personal property unless
consumers paid an upfront fee to recover it caused or was likely to cause
substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by
countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.

Respondent is liable for the actions of its repossession agents related to
detaining consumersâ personal property.

Respondent, through its repossession agents, therefore engaged in unfair
acts and practices, in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c),

5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondent, Through its Service Provider, Deprived Consumers of the Ability

34.

to Choose Pay by Phone Options with Significantly Lower Fees
Respondent permits consumers to make Account payments online,

telephonically, by mail, or through an auto-debit program.

Respondent engaged a third-party payment processor to handle consumer
calls regarding telephonic payments and to process those payments.

This payment processor handled over 18 million payments for Respondent
between 2012 and 2017. The payment processorâs agents spoke to
consumers on Respondentâs behalf to obtain payments on Respondentâs
Accounts.

From 2012 through late 2017, the payment processor charged
Respondentâs consumers $5 for payments by electronic check or in-
network debit-card payments and $12.95 for credit-card and out-of-
network debit-card payments. In-network debit-cards are cards that could
be processed without a PIN over the Star, NYCE, Pulse, or Accel ATM
networks.

Until at least late 2017, some of Respondentâs consumer-facing materials,
such as billing invoices, stated that âtransaction fees may applyâ for
telephonic payments.

None of Respondentâs consumer-facing materials disclosed the fee
amounts for telephonic payments or the considerable price difference
between available methods of payment by phone.

Many of Respondentâs customers called and made payments by phone

through Respondentâs third-party phone-payment processor. Many of

those consumers elected to make credit-card or out-of-network debit-card
payments. In many cases where consumers elected one of those options,
Respondentâs third-party phone-payment-processing vendor failed to tell
consumers about significant differences in the fees.
This practice caused or was likely to cause substantial injury to consumers.
Numerous consumers were charged $7.95 more to make a phone payment
than they would have been if they had selected a different payment option,
and they often made those selections without information about the lower-
fee options.
This injury was not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing
benefits to consumers or competition.
Respondent is liable for the acts of the third-party payment processor.
Respondent, through the third-party payment processor, therefore engaged
in unfair acts and practices, in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5531(c), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Acts or Practices
An act or practice is deceptive under the CFPA if (1) there is a
representation or omission of information that is likely to mislead
consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances; and (11) that

information is material to consumers.

Respondentâs Extension Agreements Misrepresented Consumersâ
Bankruptcy Rights

Respondent offers loan extension agreements to some consumers who are
experiencing financial difficulties.
From at least January 2012 through February 2017, Respondentâs
extension agreement contracts, as well as written confirmations it sent to
consumers who agreed to extensions orally, included the following
language:

As acondition of you making this request, you represent that you

have not filed and agree that you will not file for bankruptcy

protection within 120 days after the date of this correspondence, and

that an extension is contingent upon the absence of any such filing. If

you should so file for bankruptcy protection, then this agreement is

void for misrepresentation, and we may seek payment of the extended

payments as originally scheduled and may deem such payment to be

in default.
From 2012 through 2016, Respondent sent extension agreements or
written confirmations of oral agreements including this language to
between 50,000 to 150,000 consumers each year.
Respondentâs extension agreements created the net impression that
consumers could not file for bankruptcy.
In truth and in fact, consumers could file for bankruptcy. An agreement to

waive an individualâs right to file for bankruptcy is void as against public

policy.

14
2020-BCFP-0017 Document1 Filed 10/13/2020 Page 15 of 40

51. These statements are material because they were likely to affect
consumersâ conduct in executing the written extension agreement or
considering whether to file for bankruptcy.

52. Respondentâs representations were false and misleading and constituted
deceptive acts or practices, in violation of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§

5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Conduct Provisions

IT IS ORDERED, under sections 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, that:
53. Respondent, and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys

misrepresent, or assist others in misrepresenting, expressly or impliedly:

i. That a consumer may not file for bankruptcy; or
iit. Any other fact material to consumers concerning their rights
related to initiating a bankruptcy proceeding.
54. Respondent and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys

Repossessions that occur after the Effective Date to identify any patterns
or practices that need to be addressed;

Respondent must adopt reasonable policies and procedures to remedy

Repossession, or two business days after Respondentâs receipt of
evidence of actual costs incurred. It is further provided that Respondent
must promptly notify the consumer of her right to provide such evidence
of actual costs incurred;

. Respondent must prohibit its repossession agents (through contract or
otherwise) from charging personal property fees to NMAC consumers
directly and demanding fees as a condition of returning personal
property;

. If Respondent offers consumers the option to make Account payments by
phone, Respondent must, on each call during which a consumer makes
such a payment, clearly disclose to the consumer the fee for each method
of making a payment by phone, before the consumer is asked which

i. For all Affected Consumers, Respondent:

1. Shall complete a review of all information furnished to any
consumer reporting agency from October 1, 2013 through the
Effective Date to determine whether information Respondent
furnished to any consumer reporting agency requires correction
or updating consistent with 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(2); and

2. Shall use the results of the review required by paragraph (1)(1)
to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer
reporting agencies consistent with 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(2). In
the event that Respondent cannot, after its review, verify that
information it furnished about Affected Consumers requires
correction or updating, it shall request that the consumer
reporting agency delete the furnished information, unless the
final account status or payment rating indicates that the account
is current. Respondent will not thereafter re-furnish any

inaccurate or incomplete information.

Under section 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section IV of this Consent Order, and taking

Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled
to, nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any
compensatory monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer
Action because of the civil money penalty paid in this action. If the court
in any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount
of compensatory monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on
the civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that
the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within
30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify
the Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S.
Treasury. Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money

penalty and will not change the amount of the civil money penalty

returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Nissan Motor Acceptance
Corporation for Illegal Collections and Repossession Practices

OCT 13, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (Nissan), an auto financing
subsidiary of Nissan North America, Inc., which services auto loans and leases originated by
Nissan and Infiniti dealerships nationwide. Nissanâs servicing operations are headquartered
in Irving, Texas. The Bureau found that Nissan and its agents: wrongfully repossessed
vehicles; kept personal property in consumersâ repossessed vehicles until consumers paid a
storage fee; deprived consumers paying by phone of the ability to select payment options
with significantly lower fees; and, in its loan extension agreements, made a deceptive
statement that appeared to limit consumersâ bankruptcy protections. These actions violated
the Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against unfair and deceptive
acts and practices. Today's consent order requires Nissan to provide up to $1 million of
cash redress to consumers subject to a wrongful repossession, credit any outstanding
account charges associated with a wrongful repossession, and to pay a civil money penalty
of $4 million. It also imposes certain requirements to prevent future violations and
remediate consumers whose vehicles are wrongfully repossessed going forward.

The Bureau specifically found that, from 2013 through September of 2019, Nissan
repossessed hundreds of consumersâ vehicles despite the consumer having made
payments or otherwise taken actions that should have prevented the repossession. The
Bureau also found that, from at least early 2014 through late August 2017, Nissanâs
repossession agents, with Nissanâs knowledge, demanded that consumers pay a separate,
upfront storage fee for personal property contained in repossessed vehicles. These agents
refused to return consumersâ personal property until the consumers paid the fee.

The Bureau further found that, from 2012 through part of 2017, Nissan deprived consumers
paying by phone of the ability to select pay-by-phone options with significantly lower fees.
Numerous consumers paid $7.95 more to make a phone payment than they would have if
they had known of and selected a different payment option. The Bureau also found that
when Nissan agreed to modify a consumer's loan payments, for tens of thousands of
consumers, Nissan used agreements or written confirmations that included language that
created the net misimpression that consumers could not file for bankruptcy.

The Bureau's consent order requires Nissan to refund fees paid by consumers, credit any
outstanding charges stemming from the repossession, and pay consumers redress for each
day Nissan wrongfully held the car. Nissan must also pay a civil money penalty of $4 million.
The consent order also requires Nissan to prohibit its repossession agents from charging
personal property fees to consumers directly and from demanding fees as a condition of
returning personal property; to correct its repossession practices and conduct a quarterly
review to discover and remediate any future wrongful repossessions; to clearly disclose to
consumers the fee for each method of making a payment by phone before consumers are
asked which method they wish to use; and to stop using any language that creates the
impression that consumers have surrendered their bankruptcy rights.

The consent order is available at:

IV.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

Omni is an installment lender that is incorporated in Nevada and has its
principal place of business in Las Vegas. It operates using the trade names
Omni Financial and Omni Military Loans, and it specializes in lending to

consumers affiliated with the military. Its loans typically range from $500 to
$10,000 over a typical term of between 6 and 36 months. Omni originates
tens of thousands of loans each year.
Because Omni originates installment loans for personal or household use, it
is a âcovered personâ under the CPFA; 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (6), (7), &
(15)(A)G); and Omniâs loans are a âconsumer financial product or service.â
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (7), (15)(A)G).

Findings and Conclusions as to Omniâs Allotment Practices
In 2006, Congress amended Title 10 to add a new section commonly
referred to as the Military Lending Act, which provides consumer
protections for servicemembers. John Warner National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, Pub. L. No. 109-364, Â§ 670(a), 120
Stat 2083 (codified at 10 U.S.C. Â§ 987).
Among these protections, the MLA makes it illegal for a creditor, such as
Omni during the Relevant Period, to extend consumer credit to Covered
Members or their dependents if the creditor requires them to repay by
allotment. 10 U.S.C. Â§ 987(e)(6).
About 90% of Omniâs loans are extended to Covered Members, as that term
is defined in 10 U.S.C. Â§ 987(4)(1).
The allotment system is run by the Department of Defense and dates back to

the days before automatic bill-pay and internet banking. The system allows a

servicemember to designate a portion of each paycheck to certain recipients

other than the servicemember. The allotment system was intended to help
ensure that servicemembers could pay their obligations while they were
deployed or otherwise unavailable to handle personal finances. Over the
years, this has become less necessary as technology has made it easier to
make payments automatically or remotely.

When active-duty servicemembers and active-duty Guard or Reserve
Members who are Covered Members apply for loans from Omni, Omni
employees tell the Covered Members that in order to get the loan they must
repay by allotment.

99% of active-duty servicemembers and active-duty Guard or Reserve
members who are Covered Members and who get loans from Omni repay
their loans by allotment.

Omni has benefited from this practice because the allotment system helps
guarantee payment on unsecured loans, meaning that borrowers who repay
by allotment have lower delinquency and default rates. And Affected
Consumers have been harmed in the amount of interest and fees paid
because they were wrongfully deprived of the option to pay by means
other than allotment.

Therefore, Omni violated the MLA. 10 U.S.C. Â§ 987(e)(6).

Findings and Conclusions as to
Omniâs Preauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers Practices

Omni also lends to civilians and non-covered servicemembers, such as

military retirees, some of whom do not have access to the allotment system.

Omni often permits these borrowers to pay by check, cash, credit card, or
ACH, among other means.

Regardless of the repayment method selected by the borrower, Omni
requires every borrower to provide bank account and routing information.
And each consumer must sign a contract that authorizes Omni to initiate an
electronic-fund transfer from the identified bank account on the scheduled
payment date in the event of a payment default under the primary payment
method. Under the contract, Omni is authorized to initiate an electronic-
fund transfer on the first business day after the due date of a payment that
has been missed.

EFTA states that no person may condition an extension of credit on a
consumerâs agreement to repay by a preauthorized electronic-fund transfer.
15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693k(1).

The terms in Omniâs contracts constitute preauthorized electronic-fund
transfers because they authorize in advance an electronic-fund transfer to
occur at substantially regular intervals (i.e., the first business day after a

missed payment and each successive payment thereafter until the borrower

makes a payment by another means). 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693a(1).

Therefore, Omni violated EFTA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693k(1).

Section 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA prohibits covered persons from offering
or providing a consumer-financial product or service that is not in
conformity with Federal consumer-financial law. 12 U.S.C. Â§5536(a)(1)(A).
EFTA is a Federal consumer-financial law. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(12)(C), (14).
Omniâs loans were not offered or provided in conformity with EFTA, as
described above.
Therefore, Omni violated the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

CONDUCT PROVISIONS

V.

IT IS ORDERED, under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, that:
Omni and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who have
actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or indirectly,

borrower who is a Covered Member under the MLA on that Covered
Memberâs agreement to repay by allotment; or 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693k(1) by
conditioning any loan on a borrowerâs agreement to repay by preauthorized

electronic fund transfer.

Within 30 days of receiving notice of the Enforcement Directorâs

nonobjection to the Compliance Plan, Omni must contact in writing,

which may be electronic, each borrower who has a loan with an

outstanding balance and who, as of the Effective Date, is repaying his or

her loan by allotment, and Clearly and Prominently:

a. inform the borrower of this Consent Order and provide a summary of the
Bureauâs findings and conclusions;

b. inform the borrower that the borrower may choose to repay his or her
loan using a different repayment method;

c. list all repayment methods available to the borrower; and

d. provide a method by which the borrower may elect an alternative
repayment option.

Omni and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who have

actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or indirectly,

may not make any representation or statement, or take any other action that

interferes with, detracts from, contradicts, or otherwise undermines the

communications required under this Paragraph. Omni shall include no other

materials with the notice unless Omni has obtained written confirmation

from the Enforcement Director that the Bureau does not object to the

inclusion of such materials.

After the occurrence of all events specified in 9 31-32, Omni and its
26.

27.

officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who have actual notice
of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or indirectly, may not draft
the bank account of a borrower who has an outstanding loan as of the
Effective Date (unless the borrower has, as of the Effective Date, elected to
repay the loan by EFT as the borrowerâs primary repayment method) unless
Omni obtains a new authorization to draft that borrowerâs bank account. The
new authorization must be in writing, which may be electronic, and signed
by the consumer. Omni must Clearly and Prominently disclose to the
consumer that the authorization is optional.

For loans made after the occurrence of all events specified in 4 31-32,
Omni and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who have
actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or indirectly,
may not accept a payment by allotment without first obtaining authorization
that is signed by the consumer to repay by allotment. Such authorization,
which may be electronic, must be in a document that is separate from the
loan contract document and any other document and must Clearly and
Prominently disclose to the consumer that repayment by allotment is
optional and that the consumer may change his or her repayment method at
any time.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date and at least annually thereafter, Omni

10
28.

29.

must provide a training to each employee involved in loan origination. Such
training must inform the employee that no consumer is required to repay his

or her loan by allotment.

Omni and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who have
actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or indirectly,
may not:

a. take any action to incentivize Omniâs employees, contractors, or other
agents to obtain authorizations from consumers to repay loans by
allotment; or

b. consider the number or rate of consumers that have elected to repay their
loans by allotment (or any proxy thereof) when evaluating the
performance of any employee, contractor, or other agent.

Beginning no later than 30 days of the Effective Date, Omni must provide

each consumer with a written statement, which may be electronic, for

each billing cycle, within a reasonably prompt time after the payment due

date, that Clearly and Prominently contains at least the following:

a. loan balance;

b. the total of all payments received since the last statement;

c. the total of all payments received since the beginning of the calendar

year;

1]
30.

31.

d. the amount due for the next payment; and

e. any fees assessed.
VI.

Compliance Plan

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, Omni must submit to the Enforcement

Director for review and determination of non-objection a comprehensive

compliance plan designed to ensure that Omniâs repayment-selection

practices comply with all applicable Federal consumer financial laws, the

MLA, and the terms of this Consent Order (Compliance Plan). The

Compliance Plan must include, at a minimum:

a. detailed steps for addressing each action required by this Consent Order;

b. draft communications required under Â§ 24 and information about their
dissemination;

c. draft authorizations referred to in 9Â§ 25 and 26 and information about their
dissemination; and

d. specific timeframes and deadlines for implementation of the steps
described above.

The Enforcement Director will have the discretion to make a

determination of non-objection to the Compliance Plan or direct Omni to

revise it. If the Enforcement Director directs Omni to revise the
12
32.

33.

34.

35.

Compliance Plan, Omni must revise and resubmit the Compliance Plan to

the Enforcement Director within 15 days.

After receiving notification that the Enforcement Director has madea
determination of non-objection to the Compliance Plan, Omni must
implement and adhere to the steps, recommendations, deadlines, and
timeframes outlined in the Compliance Plan.
VIL.

Role of the Board
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
The Board must review all submissions (including plans, reports, programs,
policies, and procedures) required by this Consent Order before submission
to the Bureau.
Although this Consent Order requires Omni to submit certain documents for
review or non-objection by the Enforcement Director, the Board will have
the ultimate responsibility for proper and sound management of Omni and
for ensuring that Omni complies with the laws that the Bureau enforces,
including Federal consumer financial laws, the MLA, and this Consent
Order.
In each instance that this Consent Order requires the Board to ensure

adherence to the Consent Order, or perform certain obligations of Omni, the

13
36.

37.

38.

Board must:

a. authorize whatever actions are necessary for Omni to fully comply with
the Consent Order;

b. require timely reporting by management to the Board on the status of
compliance obligations; and

c. Require timely and appropriate corrective action to remedy any material
non-compliance with any failures to comply with Omni directives related
to this Section.

MONETARY PROVISIONS
VI.

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Â§ IV of this Consent Order, and taking into
account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Omni must pay a civil money
penalty of $2,175,000 to the Bureau.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Omni must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in
compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in

14
39.

40.

the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,

12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

Omni, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under this
Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how the
Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Omni may not:
a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, retmbursement or indemnification
from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any
insurance policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this
Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Omni may not argue that Omni is entitled to, nor may
Omni benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory monetary
remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the civil
money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the Bureau
makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related Consumer
Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary
remedies imposed against Omni based on the civil money penalty paid in

this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil

15
Al.

42.

43.

44,

Penalty Fund, Omni must, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting

such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset

or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be considered an
additional civil money penalty and will not change the amount of the civil
money penalty imposed in this action.

IX.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Omniâs obligations to make payment under
this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as amended,
will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of default to
the date of payment, and will immediately become due and payable.
Omni relinquishes all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid to the
fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be returned to
Omni.
Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Omni, unless it already has done so, must furnish

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Omni Financial of Nevada, Inc.
for Violations of the Military Lending Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and
Consumer Financial Protection Act

DEC 30, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Omni Financial of Nevada, Inc. (Omni). The Bureau found that Omni
violated the Military Lending Act (MLA), Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) in connection with making installment loans. Omni,
which has its principal place of business in Las Vegas, Nevada, and operates using the
names Omni Financial and Omni Military Loans, specializes in lending to consumers
affiliated with the military. It originates tens of thousands of loans each year, with individual
loans typically ranging from $500 to $10,000. The consent order requires that Omni pay a
$2.175 million civil money penalty and imposes injunctive relief to stop ongoing violations
and prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the second in the Bureau's sweep of investigations of multiple lenders that
may be violating the MLA. The MLA puts in place protections in connection with extensions
of consumer credit for active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, who are defined
as âcovered borrowers.â These protections include prohibiting that loans to covered
borrowers be required to be repaid by âallotment.â The Department of Defense runs the
allotment system, which allows servicemembers to designate a portion of their paycheck to
certain recipients. The Bureau found that, since October 2016, Omnis loans to covered
borrowers violated the MLAâs prohibition of requiring repayment by allotment.

The Bureau also found that Omni violated EFTA and the CFPA. In addition to lending to
active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, Omni lends to civilians and non-covered
servicemembers, such as military retirees. The Bureau found that Omni requires all of its
borrowers to provide bank-account information and authorize Omni to withdraw funds from
that account on the first business day after each missed payment. Omni's requirement that
consumers allow it to withdraw funds from their bank accounts violates EFTAâs prohibition
against requiring consumers to preauthorize electronic fund transfers as a condition of
receiving credit. The Bureau further found that these EFTA violations constituted CFPA
violations.

In addition to prohibiting future violations, the consent order requires Omni to provide
notice of the Bureauâs findings to all customers repaying their loans by allotment along with
notice that they may change their repayment method. Omni also must provide training to
employees and is prohibited from providing any incentives to employees or performance
evaluations that consider the number or rate of consumers who choose to repay by
allotment.

PEAKS. Subject to certain conditions and limitations contained in
certain PEAKS Private Student Loan Program agreements, servicing
of the Loans is performed by the Servicer. PEAKS and the other

program documents, including, where applicable, acting through
agents and contractors including the Servicer

The current balance of the Loans, including principal, outstanding
interest, and outstanding fees, is approximately $330 million.

PEAKS has not acquired, and will not acquire, loans other than the
Loans, does not conduct business other than the PEAKS Private
Student Loan Program, and intends to cease conducting that business

ORDER

I.

ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND
TO TAKE OTHER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

IT IS ORDERED that:

21.

As of the Effective Date :
a. PEAKS will terminate all collections activities and terminate
the acceptance of payments from consumers related to any

Loan; and
b. Defendants will take no further action, directly or through any
agent or contractor, to enforce or to collect any Loan.

c. Notwithstanding the requirements of subparagraphs (a) and (b)
of this Paragraph, Defendants will not be regarded as in
violation of this Order if they or the Servicer send out routine
statements or notices that could be considered collection
activity within 20 days after the Effective Date; nor will
Defendants be regarded as in violation of this Order in the event
that a payment from a consumer related to any Loan is
discovered to have been accepted or processed after the
Effective Date, provided that Defendants or the Servicer make
efforts to return the payment to the consumer as specified in the
Redress Plan.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, PEAKS, DBNTC, as lender
trustee, and DBTCA, as indenture trustee and collateral agent, will
discharge and cancel all outstanding balances of all Affected
Consumersâ Loan accounts, including associated fees, charges, and
interest.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, PEAKS will cause the Servicer

8
24.

25.

to submit written requests to all Consumer Reporting Agencies to
which Defendants or the Servicer has reported information about the
Affected Consumersâ Loans, directing those Consumer Reporting
Agencies to delete the consumer trade lines associated with the
Affected Consumersâ Loans by updating those consumer trade lines
with the appropriate codes to reflect that each of those consumer trade
lines has been deleted and, if an explanation is required, with the
codes referencing a negotiated court settlement.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, PEAKS will send notifications
to the Affected Consumers, by first class mail to the most recently
available postal address contained in the Servicerâs system of record
for each Affected Consumer, informing them of the new status of their
Loans, and the requested updated status of the credit reporting related
to their Loans, consistent with this Order.

Except as and to the extent provided herein and in the Redress Plan,
Defendants will relinquish all dominion, control, and title to all Loan
payments made after the Effective Date. No part of those funds may

be retained by Defendants.
26.

27.

In the event that Loan payments made after the Effective Date are
Unreturnable Funds as defined in the Redress Plan, Defendants will
pay any such funds to the Bureau, by wire transfer to the Bureau or to
the Bureauâs agent, according to the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

The Bureau may make continued attempts to distribute those funds to
consumers. If the Bureau determines, in its sole discretion, that such
additional distribution is wholly or partially impracticable or
otherwise inappropriate, or if funds remain after the additional
distribution is completed, the Bureau will deposit the remaining
unreturnable funds with the United States Treasury as a miscellaneous
receipt. Defendants will have no right to challenge any actions that the
Bureau or its representatives may take under this Section.

Upon the Effective Date, Defendants will promptly begin
implementation of the Redress Plan. The Enforcement Director has
reviewed the Redress Plan and has made a determination of non-
objection. Defendants will implement and adhere to the steps,
recommendations, deadlines, and timeframes outlined in the Redress

Plan.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Multiple States Enter Into Settlement
with Owner of ITT Private Loans for Substantially Assisting ITT in Unfair Practices

SEP 15, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
proposed stipulated judgment against PEAKS Trust 2009-1, along with Deutsche Bank
National Trust Company, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Delaware, and Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas, in their capacity as trustees to PEAKS Trust 2009-1 (collectively,
âPEAKS""). In its complaint, filed in the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, the
Bureau alleged that PEAKS provided substantial assistance to ITT Educational Services, Inc.
(ITT) in engaging in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010. PEAKS owned and managed private loans for students at ITT
Technical Institute. PEAKS allegedly knew or was reckless in not knowing that many student
borrowers did not understand the terms and conditions of those loans, could not afford
them, or in some cases did not even know they had them. If entered by the court, the
proposed judgment will require PEAKS to forgive all of its outstanding loansâapproximately
$330 million in debt- for about 35,000 borrowers who currently have outstanding principal
balances. Forty-seven states plus the District of Columbia have also settled with PEAKS
today.

ITT operated ITT Technical Institute until it filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in
2016. The Bureau filed suit against ITT in February, 2014, alleging that ITT engaged in
unlawful acts and practices to push students into private student loans in a scheme to
improve the appearance of ITTâs financial statements and its standing among investors. To
this end, ITT developed two private loan programs, the Student CU Connect CUSO, LLC
(CUSO) and PEAKS loan programs. Despite knowledge that the default rate on these loans
would be high-and in fact defaults reached in excess of 94 percent and 80 percent for the
two private loan programs-ITT and its partners pressed on, issuing high cost loans to
students in order to temporarily improve ITTâs balance sheet. In the end, while ITTâs partners
were paid guarantee payments by ITT to cover much of their losses, ITT students were left
saddled with high cost loans, derogatory information on their credit reports, or both.

The Bureau's complaint against PEAKS alleged that ITT arranged for the PEAKS loans to be
serviced and collected on after ITT had induced its students to take out the loans by a
variety of unfair practices, including rushing students through financial aid appointments,
using aggressive tactics, and in some cases, gaining unauthorized access to student
accounts to sign students up for loans without permission. The Bureau alleged that PEAKS
was actively involved in servicing and managing the PEAKS loan program, including the
collection of the loans, and that PEAKSâs conduct constituted substantial assistance of ITTâs
unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA.

If entered by the court, the proposed stipulated judgment would require PEAKS to stop
collecting on all outstanding PEAKS loans, discharge all outstanding PEAKS loans, and ask
all consumer reporting agencies to which PEAKS furnished information to delete
information relating to PEAKS loans. The order would also require PEAKS to provide notice
to all consumers with outstanding PEAKS loans that their debt has been discharged and is
no longer owed and that PEAKS is seeking to have the relevant consumer reporting
information deleted. The total amount of loan forgiveness is currently estimated to be $330
million, for about 35,000 consumers with outstanding balances owed on their PEAKS loans.

Todayâs settlement with PEAKS marks the third settlement by the Bureau related to ITTâs
private loan programs. On June 14, 2019, the Bureau announced a settlement with CUSO,
another company that had been set up to hold and manage a separate portfolio of private
loans for ITT students. Under that settlement, the CUSO was required to discharge
approximately $168 million in loans. The settlements with CUSO and PEAKS combined
provide nearly $500 million in private student-loan debt-relief to former ITT students and
permanently put an end to the collection of the loans originated under these two private
loan programs established by ITT.

cuso-over-itt-private-loan-program/ (cfpb.gov/about-us/newsroom/bureau-settles-student-
cu-connect-cuso-over-itt-private-loan-program/)

 

 

In addition, on August 12, 2019, the Bureau announced a settlement in its lawsuit against
ITT Educational Services, which included a judgment against ITT for $60 million and an
injunction prohibiting ITT from offering or providing student loans in the future. Information

9. PSLC was a student-loan document-preparation and debt-relief service. It
prepared and submitted paperwork for consumers to the U.S. Department of Education
(âEDâ) in support of applications for loan consolidation, income-driven repayment plans,
forgiveness programs, and other debt-relief options available to consumers with federal
student loans. It also submitted recertification paperwork to ED for one or two years
after a consumerâs application for repayment programs was accepted.

10. ED does not charge federal student loan borrowers to submit applications to
participate in loan consolidation, income-driven repayment plans, forgiveness programs,
and other debt-relief programs or to submit recertification paperwork for those programs.

11. Formed in late 2015, PSLC solicited and signed up consumers nationwide

by telephone, using lead generators to transfer consumer phone calls to PSLCâs sales

staff.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 4of21 Page ID #:4

12. PSLC collected a fee for its services in two ways: (1) by way of a loan
provided to PSLCâs customers by a third-party finance company, Equitable Acceptance
Corporation (âEACâ), and (2) by requiring its customers to make monthly installment
payments of the fee into trust accounts established for that purpose. Under both payment
methods, PSLC requested or received payment of its fee in advance of consumers making
any payments on loan consolidations or modifications that PSLC obtained for them.

13. The first way that PSLC charged its fee was through financing. From late
2015 through 2017, PSLC partnered with EAC, an indirect finance company that enters
into contracts with businesses to offer and provide credit to customers of those businesses

to pay for services.

14. Pursuant to an agreement with PSLC, EAC extended credit in the form of a
high-interest loan to many of PSLCâs customers, on a case-by-case basis, to pay for
PSLCâs services. For these customers, PSLCâs fee (not including the interest on the loan)
was $1,450.

15. During PSLCâs sales calls with a consumer to pitch enrollment in PSLCâs
program, the PSLC sales agent would request the $1,450 fee and offer the consumer a
loan from EAC to cover the fee if he or she met certain creditworthiness requirements.
PSLC used an electronic portal connected to EAC to enter the consumerâs financial
information and determine whether the consumer met EACâs requirements. If the
consumer agreed to the financing, the sales agent would electronically provide the
consumer with the PSLC contract and the EAC loan agreement (or cause EAC to provide
the loan agreement by means of the portal) and require the consumer to e-sign both
documents while on the call.

16. When they signed the EAC loan agreement, these consumers (âLoan
Customersâ) became obligated on the loan at the inception of their relationship with

PSLC.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page5of21 Page ID#:5

17. The EAC loan financed PSLCâs $1,450 service fee with an annual
percentage rate that was typically between 17% and 22% and a term of three years. The
effective interest rate was higher due to compounding. Thus, Loan Customers were
charged hundreds of dollars in addition to PSLCâs stated $1,450 fee.

18. Some Loan Customers were required to make a $200 cash deposit into a
trust account as a down payment on PSLCâs fee, and to finance the remaining $1,250.

19. EAC paid PSLC a portion of the $1,450 service fee within two weeks of a
Loan Customer signing the loan document at enrollment, holding a certain percentage
back in reserve depending on its assessment of the risk that the customer would default.
Typically, EACâs initial payment to PSLC was 40-60% of the $1,450 fee.

20. The EAC loan would appear on Loan Customersâ credit histories. After
signing the EAC loan agreement, Loan Customers were expected to make monthly
payments of principal and interest to EAC for three years, typically in the amount of $40
to $50 per month.

21. Some Loan Customers were confused about the loan payments to EAC,
believing that the money was going to pay their student debt and that at the end of the
three-year term of the loan, their student debt would be forgiven.

22. The second way PSLC charged its fee was by directing customers to pay by
monthly installments into a dedicated trust account with a third-party trust account
provider. The duration of the payment schedule and the amount of the monthly payment
varied, but these customers (âTrust Plan Customersâ) were generally charged a fee
ranging from $1,000 to $1,450.

23. PSLC required that Trust Plan Customers make the initial monthly payment
on the day of enrollment or within a few days of enrollment. Some Trust Plan Customers
chose a payment schedule consisting of larger installments paid monthly for a period less
than a year, while others chose a payment schedule of smaller installments paid monthly

for 12 to 18 months.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 6of21 Page ID #:6

24. PSLC established trust accounts for its customers for no other purpose than
the payment of fees. In addition to making payments toward PSLCâs fee, Trust Plan
Customers also were required to pay a monthly banking fee of $6 to the third-party
administrator of the trust accounts. Some Trust Plan Customers paid additional amounts
in banking fees and fees to the third-party trust administrator, such as when a payment
was declined for insufficient funds. Trust Plan Customers paid at least $150,000 in such
additional charges.

25. PSLCâs practice has been to take the amounts accrued in a Trust Plan
Customerâs trust account after the consolidation or other loan modification was approved
by ED but before the Trust Plan Customer had made any payment under the
consolidation or loan modification.

26. PSLC did not provide Trust Plan Customers with any documentation that
included a disclosure informing those customers that they owned the funds in their trust
accounts and could withdraw them at any time without penalty.

27. PSLC terminated the relationship with EAC in late 2017. But as of February
2020, nearly 1,300 Loan Customers were still obligated on their loans to EAC.

28. From 2016 to 2019, PSLC enrolled more than 6,500 customers in multiple
states. From 2016 to late 2019, Trust Plan Customers paid more than $4,300,000 in fees
to PSLC. From 2016 to early 2020, Loan Customers paid more than $4,900,000 in loan
principal and interest to EAC.

29. PSLC ceased enrolling new consumers in 2019, although it continued to
collect fees from Trust Plan Customers in 2019 and 2020. PSLC ceased operations in
2020.

30. Crenshaw, as the sole owner and CEO of PSLC, participated in decisions,
policies, and practices relating to the manner and timing in which fees were charged to
and collected from both Loan Customers and Trust Plan Customers. Crenshaw was

responsible for the arrangement with EAC. He signed the contract with EAC and

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 7 of21 Page ID#:7

communicated directly with the top management of EAC concerning loans to Loan
Customers, payments from EAC to PSLC, and EACâs financing model. Crenshaw
provided the information for the application that initiated PSLCâs relationship with the
third-party trust administrator, which enabled the Trust Plan Customersâ accounts to be
established. He communicated directly with the manager of the trust administrator.

31. As the sole owner and CEO of PSLC, Crenshaw exercised control over the
company. He oversaw all managers at PSLC and participated in the companyâs day-to-
day business operations. He opened and was a signatory on the companyâs bank
accounts.

32. Crenshaw knew about or was recklessly indifferent to the manner and timing
in which fees were charged to customers. He knew or was recklessly indifferent to the
fact that Loan Customers became obligated at enrollment to pay EAC. He knew or was
recklessly indifferent to the fact that PSLC was requiring Trust Plan Customers to make
monthly fee payments into trust accounts beginning at or just after enrollment. He
reviewed payment reports and oversaw collections. Crenshaw reviewed customer
complaints that discussed the fees and the EAC loans.

33. In January 2016, at the very early stages of PSLCâs existence, PSLCâs legal
counsel warned Crenshaw about the timing of the companyâs fees. In an email to
Crenshaw, he stated: âthe consumer CANâT owe or be obligated to anyone until the

[student loan] debt is consolidated and a payment is made to the DOE [ED ].â

PSettlementâs Business Practices
34. PSettlement is a consumer debt-settlement company that Crenshaw formed
and began operating in 2015. PSettlement charges a fee of 25% of a customerâs enrolled
debt to negotiate settlements of the debt.
35. PSettlement solicits and signs up consumers in multiple states by telephone,

using lead referral services to transfer consumer phone calls to PSettlementâs sales staff.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 8of21 Page ID#:8

36. One such lead referral company is OneLoanPlace.com (âOLPâ), which has
described itself as a âloan matching serviceâ for consumers. OLP is not a lender and
does not provide loans itself. As of 2019, based on records of PSettlementâs commission
payments to its lead generators, at least 3,000 of PSettlementâs referrals came from OLP.

37. Under its contract with PSettlement, OLP refers âQualifying Customersâ to
PSettlement. âQualifying Customersâ are consumers residing in certain states âwith
greater than $10,000 in unsecured debt, who have been determined by [OLP] agents to be
viable candidates for [PSettlement]âs debt resolution services in [OLP]âs sole discretion.â
In return, PSettlement pays OLP a commission calculated as a percentage of any fee that
PSettlement collects from a referred consumer who enrolls in PSettlementâs debt
resolution program.

38. One way OLP refers consumers to PSettlement is through an online
questionnaire for consumers who are seeking a personal or debt consolidation loan.
OLPâs questionnaire asks about the consumerâs credit score, the size of the loan that he or
she is seeking, and other financial information. After certain consumers submit the

Performanceâ â omitting the âSettlementâ part of its name â and giving contact
information for OLP and âPerformance.â OLP also puts consumers in touch with
PSettlement via live call transfers of consumers looking for a loan.

39. Even though these consumers are seeking loans and PSettlement is not a
lender, PSettlementâs sales pitch misleadingly discusses the prospect of a loan.

40. After areferral by OLP, PSettlement first solicits the consumer to provide

his or her personal and financial information by telling the consumer:

We know that the loan process can be a difficult one and Iâm glad
you called let [sic] me see what we can do for you. So, what Iâm

going to do is collect as much information as possible and send it
over to my underwriting department and theyâ Il come back on the

line with results and let you know what you ultimately may or
may not qualify for.

41. After this introduction, the PSettlement salesperson, referred to as a âdebt
specialist,â obtains information about the consumerâs debts, income, and any hardship
conditions, and obtains the consumerâs permission to pull the consumerâs credit report.

42. Then the salesperson states that he or she is transferring the consumer to an
âunderwriterâ or âsenior underwriter.â The âunderwriterâ that the salesperson transfers
the consumer to is another employee of the sales department. There is no âunderwriterâ
position at PSettlement.

43. The âunderwriterâ tells the consumer that PSettlement will âunderwriteâ the
consumer for three options: a loan, a debt-resolution program, or bankruptcy. Neither
the âunderwriterâ nor PSettlement has any training or expertise in bankruptcy, nor does
PSettlement provide any bankruptcy services.

44. The next step is for the âunderwriterâ to put the consumer on mute for two
minutes. After the two minutes, the âunderwriterâ takes the phone off mute to tell the

consumer that the loan was declined:

Ok It looks like we werenât approved for the loan because the
debt to income ratio is too high. I even tried a smaller amount
with [OLP] and still was declined, and remember they are like
Lending Tree so they shopped this with all the unsecured lenders
not just one and unfortunately this is not an option.

45. PSettlementâs sales scripts contain no instructions for contacting OLP or
anyone else to help the consumer obtain a loan. PSettlementâs sales scripts contain no

scenario in which the consumer is approved for a loan.

46. After telling the consumer that he or she was not approved for a loan, the

PSettlement âunderwriterâ then states:

The good news is we did get a PREAPPROVAL for the debt
resolution program due to a DTI over 60%. The GREAT news is
IF we can get your [sic] approved for this program this is the
right fit as the total pay back is roughly 65-75% of what you owe,
which would save you thousands and give you the peace of mind
that comes with being free of these debts.

47. The âunderwriterâ moves on to pitch PSettlementâs services and persuade
the consumer to electronically sign PSettlementâs service contract during the phone call.
PSettlement uses the consumerâs personal and financial information that it collected as
part of the purported loan qualification process to steer them to sign up for PSettlementâs
services. PSettlementâs sales scripts also counsel the âunderwriterâ on how to âeducateâ
the consumer if the consumer continues to press for a loan.

48. Consumers have no way of knowing that PSettlement is not in fact assisting
them to obtain a loan during the sales call.

49. In addition, after telling consumers they were denied for a loan, the
âunderwriterâ tells the consumer about the possibility of a âfresh startâ loan from another
company that they could âbecome eligible forâ if they sign up for PSettlementâs program

and make six consecutive deposits into their trust accounts. PSettlement tells consumers:

The Fresh Start program is definitely a powerful financial tool,
but in order to be eligible to apply with our partner, you need to
begin with our Debt Resolution Program first.

50. PSettlementâs representation, after it has told consumers that they were not
approved for a loan, that it was possible for them to become eligible to obtain a loan on
the condition that they enrolled in PSettlementâs program and made certain payments,
reinforce a reasonable belief by consumers that PSettlement could obtain a loan for them,
but only if they first enrolled in PSettlementâs debt-resolution program.

51. The scripts that contain these representations were in use from at least May
2019. Two versions of the script, dated May 2019 and August 2019 respectively, contain

nearly identical language to that quoted above. In addition, it is likely that similar scripts
were in use earlier than May 2019, as PSettlement had a marketing arrangement with

OLP prior to May 2019 and the two versions of the script were labeled ââv.7â and âv.9â,
indicating that they were version 7 and version 9 of the same script.

52. Crenshaw is the controlling owner and CEO of PSettlement. Crenshaw
oversees all managers at PSettlement, was involved in creating PSettlementâs policies and
procedures, and regularly monitored the companyâs sales and customer trust accounts.
He opened PSettlementâs bank accounts, is a signatory on the accounts, and approves
disbursements from the accounts.

53. Crenshaw has participated in PSettlementâs sales pitch for leads referred by
OLP. He manages PSettlementâs relationships with lead referral services in general and
signed PSettlementâs contract with OLP in particular.

54. Crenshaw has overseen and is aware of the sales scripts and practices of the
sales department at PSettlement. He has the authority to make and has made changes to
scripts used in connection with leads generated by OLP.

55. | Crenshaw has known or has been recklessly indifferent to the fact that
PSettlementâs sales practices include deceiving consumers by pretending to try to help
them obtain a personal loan, when in reality PSettlement does nothing to help them
obtain a loan at the point of sale or enrollment and instead uses their personal and
financial information to steer them to sign up for PSettlementâs services.

57. The TSR defines âdebt relief serviceâ as âany program or service
represented, directly or by implication, to renegotiate, settle, or in any way alter the terms
of payment or other terms of the debt between a person and one or more unsecured
creditors or debt collectors, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the balance,
interest rate, or fees owed by a person to an unsecured creditor or debt collector.â 16
C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(0).

58. The TSR defines a âsellerâ as âany person who, in connection with a
telemarketing transaction, provides, offers to provide, or arranges for others to provide
goods or services to the customer in exchange for consideration.â 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(dd).

60. The TSR defines âtelemarketingâ in relevant part as âa plan, program, or
campaign which is conducted to induce the purchase of goods or services .. . by use of
one or more telephones and which involves more than one interstate telephone call.â 16
C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(gg).

61. PSLC isa telemarketer within the meaning of the TSR that engaged in
telemarketing of debt-relief services to consumers. PSLCâs marketing of its services was
done via telephone by the companyâs sales representatives. The use of the telephone was
part of a âplan, program, or campaignâ to sell PSLCâs services, and involved more than
one phone and more than one interstate phone call. Consumers who spoke to sales
representatives of PSLC were located in a number of different states outside of
California, where PSLC is located.

62. PSLC isa seller under the TSR because, in connection with its
telemarketing, it offered to provide, and did provide, services related to federal student-

loan debt in exchange for a fee. Those services were debt-relief services under the TSR

63. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-3, 5, 6, 8,

64. Itisa violation of the TSR for any seller or telemarketer in connection with
the sale of any debt-relief service to request or receive payment of any fee or
consideration for any debt-relief service until and unless: (1) the seller or telemarketer
has renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of at least one debt
pursuant to a settlement agreement, debt management plan, or other such valid
contractual agreement executed by the customer; and (2) the customer has made at least
one payment pursuant to that settlement agreement, debt-management plan, or other valid

65. PSLC isa seller and telemarketer that provided, offered to provide, or
arranged for others to provide debt-relief services.

66. With respect to Loan Customers, PSLC requested fees at the time of
enrollment in its program by requiring Loan Customers to sign a loan agreement to
finance payment of PSLCâs fee at enrollment, before their student loan debt was
consolidated or otherwise modified or they had made one payment on that altered debt.

67. With respect to Loan Customers, PSLC received a disbursement from EAC
of a significant portion of its $1,450 fee within two weeks of their enrollment, before
their student loan debt was consolidated or otherwise modified or they had made one

payment on that altered debt.

68. With respect to Loan Customers who were required to deposit $200 in a trust
account at enrollment as a down payment on PSLCâs services and financed the remainder
of the fee, PSLC requested fees before those customersâ student loan debt was
consolidated or otherwise modified or they had made one payment on that altered debt.

69. With respect to Trust Plan Customers, PSLC required them to deposit
monthly installment payments that were exclusively comprised of PSLCâs fee into a
dedicated trust account beginning at or soon after enrollment, thus requesting or receiving
fees before those customersâ student-loan debt was consolidated or otherwise modified or
they had made one payment on that altered debt.

70. PSLC took the fees from Trust Plan Customersâ dedicated accounts at the
time the terms of their debts were altered, but before those customers had made one
payment on that altered debt.

71. By the methods described above in paragraphs 9-33, PSLC requested or
received fees from its customers before PSLC had renegotiated, settled, reduced, or
otherwise altered the terms of their debts pursuant to a settlement agreement, debt-
management plan, or other such valid contractual agreement executed by the customers,
and before its customers had made one payment pursuant to that settlement agreement,
debt-management plan, or other valid contractual agreement between the customer and
the creditor or debt collector.

72. Crenshaw participated in PSLCâs requesting and receiving of fees in this
way. He was responsible for the contract and relationship with EAC and set up the
arrangement with the trust administrator to have PSLCâs customers pay fees into trusts.

control PSLCâs use of telemarketing and the manner and timing of its requests for and

(Substantial Assistance to PSLC in its Violations of the TSR)

76. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-3, 5, 6, 8,

77. The TSR prohibits any person from providing substantial assistance or
support to any seller or telemarketer when that person knows or consciously avoids
knowing that the seller or telemarketer is engaged in any act or practice that constitutes
deceptive or abusive conduct under the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b).

78. PSLC isa seller and telemarketer that provided, offered to provide, or
arranged for others to provide debt-relief services.

79. Inthe course of offering to provide or providing a debt-relief service to
consumers, PSLC requested and received fees before PSLC had renegotiated, settled,
reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of its customersâ debts pursuant to a settlement
agreement, debt-management plan, or other such valid contractual agreement executed by
the customers and before the customers had made one payment pursuant to that
settlement agreement, debt-management plan, or other valid contractual agreement
between the consumers and the creditor or debt collector. Thus, PSLC engaged in abusive
acts or practices in violation of the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5).

80. Crenshaw, as sole owner and CEO of PSLC, provided substantial assistance
or support to PSLC by, among other things, overseeing all managers at PSLC and

DEFENDANTSâ VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

88. Section 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA provides that it is âunlawful for any
covered person to offer or provide to a consumer a financial product or service not in
conformity with Federal consumer financial law, or otherwise commit any act or
omission in violation of a Federal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

consumer financial products or services, namely financial advisory services to assist
consumers with modifying the terms of any extension of credit, including by debt
settlement. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5481(6), (A5)(A)(viindD).

90. Under the CFPA, a ârelated personâ is a covered person. 12 U.S.C.
Â§ 5481(25)(B). Crenshaw is a related person with respect to both PSLC and PSettlement,
as he is an âofficer ... charged with managerial responsibility for, or controlling

93. An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material representation that is
likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances. A representation
is considered material if it involves information that is important to consumers and
therefore is likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a product.

94. Starting from at least May 2019, in connection with PSettlementâs
telemarketing campaign of debt-resolution services to consumers referred by OLP,
PSettlement has represented, expressly or by implication, to consumers that:

a. OLP has referred the consumer to PSettlement because PSettlement may
be able to help the consumer obtain a loan;

b. PSettlement is âunderwritingâ or âqualifyingâ the consumer for a loan;

c. PSettlement is collecting the consumerâs personal and financial
information to help the consumer obtain a loan; and

d. the consumer was turned down for a loan (i) after PSettlementâs
âunderwriterâ took the consumerâs personal and financial information
and determined the consumer did not qualify for a loan, and/or (i1) after
PSettlement âtried a smaller amount withâ OLP.

95. In truth and in fact:

a. OLP refers consumers to PSettlement after determining they are
candidates for debt resolution;

b. PSettlement is not and has never been a lender, and there is not and has
never been an âunderwriterâ position at PSettlement

c. PSettlement uses the consumersâ personal and financial information that
it has collected under the auspices of evaluating them for a loan to steer
them to sign up for PSettlementâs services; and

d. PSettlement does not, as a general practice, make any attempt to secure a
loan for a consumer before telling the consumer the loan was declined

and pitching the consumer to sign up for its debt-resolution program.

105. Crenshaw has knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to
PSettlementâs deceptive sales practices. He has directly contributed to the development
and approval of materials containing the deceptive statements by overseeing and making
changes to the sales scripts that PSettlement used with consumers referred by OLP, and
therefore he was aware of their contents and their deceptive nature.

on federal student loan debt; Performance Settlement, LLC (PSettlement), a California debt-
settlement company; and Daniel Crenshaw, the owner and CEO of the two companies. The
Bureau alleges that PSLC and Crenshaw charged illegal advance fees in violation of the
Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) to student loan borrowers seeking to obtain loan
consolidation, loan forgiveness, or income-driven repayment plans for their federal student
loans, and that PSLC failed to make required disclosures to certain consumers in violation of
the TSR. The Bureau also alleges that PSettlement and Crenshaw used deceptive tactics in
violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) in order to induce consumers to
sign up for PSettlement's services.

The Bureau's complaint, which was filed in federal district court for the Central District of
California, alleges that from 2015 through the present, PSLC charged consumers illegal
upfront fees by using telemarketing campaigns to convince thousands of consumers to sign
up for services to assist them in obtaining loan consolidation, loan forgiveness, or income-
driven repayment plans from the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Consumers would pay
between $1,000 and $1,450 in fees to PSLC for it to file paperwork with ED, even though
student loan borrowers can do this themselves for free. Under the TSR, it is illegal to request
or receive any fees for debt-relief services sold through telemarketing before the terms of
the debt are altered or settled, and the consumer has made at least one payment under the
newly altered debt. The Bureau alleges that the PSLC and Crenshaw violated the TSR
because consumers were charged at or just after enrollment, before the terms of the debts
were altered. The Bureau also alleges that PSLC had some consumers pay this prohibited
upfront fee through high-interest financing from a third party. Some consumers paid a
portion or all of their fee into a trust account, but the complaint alleges that PSLC failed to
provide them with disclosures required by the TSR.

The complaint also alleges that PSettlement and Crenshaw, from as early as 2019, engaged
in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by representing to consumers that
PSettlement, a debt-settlement company that does not make loans, had considered and
rejected those consumers for personal loans to induce them to sign up for PSettlementâs
debt-relief services. Finally, the Bureau alleges that Crenshaw substantially assisted PSLC in
requesting or receiving fees illegally and PSettlement in engaging in deceptive acts and
practices.

The complaint seeks redress to consumers, injunctive relief, and the imposition of civil
money penalties against the defendants.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

Overview
PHLoans is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides mortgages
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Occasionally, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in other
situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to provide
loans.
PHLoans advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
PHLoans has sent consumers millions of advertisements that violate federal
law because of misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop PHLoans from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

PHLoans offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by
the VA.

PHLoansâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since July 2016, PHLoans has mailed millions of mortgage advertisements

to consumers in at least 13 states.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, PHLoans was responsible for both the content of,
and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of PHLoansâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate or a payment amount.
By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, PHLoans represented,

expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
24.

credit terms.

In fact, PHLoans did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, PHLoans misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements misrepresented the payment
amount applicable to the advertised mortgage or the existence, nature, or
amount of cash available to the consumer in connection with the advertised
mortgage.

For example, PHLoans advertisements sent to 25 consumers from May 2018
through July 2018 stated that the consumer could âTakeâ a $20,000 cash-out
amount for âONLY $95.68 PER MONTH.â In fact, PHLoans did not offer a
product with those terms. A cash-out amount was only available if the
consumer had an existing mortgage and refinanced the entire amount owed
on that mortgage as part of a cash-out refinance mortgage loan obtained from
PHLoans, resulting in a total monthly payment greater than $95.68.
Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

Specifically, PHLoans advertisements sent to around 26,000 consumers from

October 2016 to November 2016 stated âNo Out of Pocket Expenses.â

All VA loans have closing costs. But for at least one of the products featured
in these advertisements, consumers would need to directly pay out-of-pocket
expenses at closing. Accordingly, in connection with the loan that PHLoans
was advertising, the statement âNo Out of Pocket Expensesâ was false.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 26 to
30 were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Many of PHLoansâs mortgage advertisements stated a payment amount or a
simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z,
including Â§ 1026.24(d) and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific
disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did not include the
other disclosures that are required, or did not include them in the manner
required.
For example, numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements stated a payment
amount, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the consumerâs
repayment obligations over the full term of the loan.
Specifically, PHLoans advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to

around 26,000 consumers from October 2016 to November 2016 stated a
36.

monthly payment amount of $1,394 that applied to the 3-year fixed rate
period of the loan. After the first three years, the rate was adjustable by as
much as 1% per year with a lifetime cap of 5%. While higher monthly
payments would likely apply to the variable rate period of the loan, the
advertisements did not state the amounts of those payments.

Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual rate of
interest for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply, but
failed to state, for variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by adding an
index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin.

For example, PHLoans advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
over 154,000 consumers in 2017 stated a simple annual rate of interest that
applied to the fixed-rate period of the loan (such as the first five years), but
for the variable-rate period of the loan, failed to state a rate determined by
adding a reasonably current index and margin.

Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements stated a payment amount, but
failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply over the term of
the loan (e.g., for adjustable-rate mortgages, payments based on the
application of the sum of a reasonably current index and margin); or failed to
state clearly and conspicuously that the actual payment obligation would be

greater.

2020-BCFP-0009 Document1 Filed 08/26/2020 Page 11 of 39

For example, PHLoans advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
around 39,214 consumers in 2017 stated a payment amount that was based
on an introductory, discount rate that applied only to the fixed-rate period of
the loan. That payment was not calculated based on the index and margin
that would be used to make subsequent payment adjustments over the
remaining term of the loan, and the advertisements failed to state such a
payment amount.

In addition, PHLoans advertisements sent to around 50,900 consumers in
2017 stated a payment amount, but failed to state, clearly and conspicuously,
that the actual payment obligation would be greater.

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z
Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 22-30,
numerous PHLoans advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.

Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t|he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)(11).

PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs 27 and
34-35, numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements set forth the period of
repayment, which is a triggering term under Â§ 1026.24(d)(1)(i1), but failed to
state the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§

1026.24(d)(2)(i1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i), if'a direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

a reasonably current index and margin;

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the
[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

46. PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 36-
37, numerous PHLoans direct-mail mortgage advertisements for a loan for
which more than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of
interest but did not include one or more of the disclosures required pursuant

to Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)(A) through (C), or did not disclose them clearly and

conspicuously, as defined in Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Payment Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(@)

47. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3 )(1), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be

disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;
and

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien on a

dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts

for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the

actual payment obligation will be greater.
PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)() because, as described in Paragraphs 38-
40 numerous PHLoans direct-mail mortgage advertisements stated the
amount of a payment but did not include one or more of the disclosures
required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)G)(A) through (C), or did not disclose
them clearly and conspicuously, as defined in Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i1).

VIOLATIONS OF THE MAP RULE (REGULATION N)

Misrepresentations About Fees or Costs, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t|he existence,
nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer associated with the
mortgage credit product, including but not limited to misrepresentations that
no fees are charged.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is
specifically prohibited and is therefore material.

PHLoans violated Â§ 1014.3(c) because, as described in Paragraphs 28-30,
numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the existence, nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer

associated with a mortgage credit product.

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3q), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he existence,
nature, or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection
with the mortgage credit product, including but not limited to
misrepresentations that the consumer will receive a certain amount of cash
or credit as part of a mortgage credit transaction.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3,
such a misrepresentation is specifically prohibited and is therefore material.
PHLoans violated Â§ 1014.3(j) because, as described in Paragraphs 26-27,
numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the existence, nature, or amount of cash available to the consumer in

connection with the mortgage credit product.
Misrepresentations About Payments, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(k)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(k), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he existence,
number, amount, or timing of any minimum or required payments, including

but not limited to misrepresentations about any payments or that no

payments are required in a reverse mortgage or other mortgage credit
product.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

PHLoans violated Â§ 1014.3(k) because, as described in Paragraphs 26-27,
numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the payments that would be required in connection with the advertised
mortgage credit product.

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.

Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms
In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 22-32, PHLoansâs

mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
59.

specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about payment amounts and loan costs,
when in fact those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms
that PHLoans was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

PHLoansâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

PHLoansâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or

decisions of consumers.

Therefore, PHLoans engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule

12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under

a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as

furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be used
for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount arising out
of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Fourth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

AUG 26, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against PHLoans.com, Inc. (PHLoans), a California corporation that is licensed
as a mortgage broker or lender in about 11 states. Until at least April 2019, PHLoans was
known as Pacific Home Loans, Inc. PHLoans offers and provides mortgage loans guaranteed
by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). PHLoansâs principal means of
advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to
United States military servicemembers and veterans. The Bureau found that PHLoans sent
consumers numerous mailers for VA-guaranteed mortgages that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked required disclosures, in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and
practices, the Mortgage Acts and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z.
The consent order requires PHLoans to pay a civil money penalty and imposes
requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the fourth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of
multiple mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed
mortgages. On July 24, 2020, the Bureau announced consent orders against Sovereign
Lending Group, Inc., and Prime Choice Funding, Inc., and on August 21, 2020, the Bureau
announced a consent order against Go Direct Lenders, Inc., for similar violations. The
Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising
provides consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and
terms available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This
ongoing sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws
that ensure the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including
servicemembers, veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are
designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that PHLoans disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, PHLoans advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including misrepresenting the payment amount applicable to the
advertised mortgage and the nature or amount of cash available to the consumer in
connection with the advertised mortgage. PHLoans also made misrepresentations about the
existence and amount of fees or costs to the consumer in connection with the advertised
mortgage. The Bureau also found that PHLoans advertisements failed to properly disclose,
when required by Regulation Z, credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the
consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the loan.

The consent order against PHLoans requires PHLoans to pay a civil penalty of $260,000. The
consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including requiring
PHLoans to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising compliance
official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage
advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those identified
by the Bureau; and requiring PHLoans to comply with certain enhanced disclosure
requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

In the Matter of:

CONSENT ORDER

Prime Choice Funding, Inc.

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
direct-mail mortgage advertising activities of Prime Choice Funding, Inc. (Prime
Choice or Respondent, as defined below) and identified violations of Â§ 1026.24 of
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24, the implementing regulation of the Truth in
Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1601â1667f; Â§ 1014.3 of the Mortgage Acts
and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule or Regulation N), 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.3; and Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536. Under Â§8 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12

U.S.C. 88 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order.
Overview
Prime Choice is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides
mortgages guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA). Sometimes, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in other
situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to provide
loans.
Prime Choice advertises these mortgage products to consumers through
direct-mail advertising campaigns.
Prime Choice has sent consumers millions of advertisements that violate
federal law because of misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop Prime Choice from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

athe A A

Prime Choiceâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since January 2016, Prime Choice has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in about 35 states and the District of Columbia.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of Prime
Choiceâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through Prime Choice.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Prime Choice was responsible for both the
content of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements
during the Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate
statements, as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Prime Choiceâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit
terms, such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), payment

amount, index, margin, or closing costs.
24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

29.

30.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Prime Choice
represented, expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a
mortgage with those credit terms.

In fact, Prime Choice did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific
credit terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Prime Choice misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements described mortgages with
a simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, Prime Choice was not actually prepared to arrange or offer.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 84,000 consumers in
October 2018 advertised a variable-rate mortgage with a fixed interest rate
of 2.625% for the first five years and an APR of 3.375%.

In fact, the advertised APR was not correct for any loan that Prime Choice
was prepared to arrange or offer because it did not take into account the fully
indexed rate, required discount points, or origination, underwriting, or
funding fees.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account the fully indexed rate, required discount points, and

origination, underwriting, and funding fees, was at least 4.042%.
31.

32.

33.

34.

35.

Accordingly, Prime Choice misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered
in these advertisements.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
payment amount applicable to the advertised loan.

For example, in an advertisement sent to a consumer in July 2016, Prime
Choice misstated the payment amounts that would apply to the advertised
loans. The advertisement stated that a consumer seeking a loan amount of
$366,715 could obtain a 2.75% APR fixed-rate loan with a payment amount
of $840, and that the consumer could obtain an additional $30,000 in cash
for a total new payment amount of $909. Those payment amounts were
false; the actual minimum payments that would apply to the advertised loans
were each at least $600 more than the advertised payment amounts.
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
existence, nature, or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in
connection with the mortgage.

For example, in advertisements sent to more than 87,000 consumers in April
2019, Prime Choice stated: âYou have been pre-selected for a U.S.
Department of Veteran Affairs program that allows you to combine your
mortgage and other debt, plus get an additional $27,500 in unrestricted cash

today for only $125.41 per month.â But in order for the consumer to
36.

37.

38.

39.

40.

âcombine [their] mortgage and other debtâ and obtain $27,500 in cash, the
consumer would have to have more than $27,500 in equity in their homeâa
factor that Prime Choice did not take into consideration when selecting the
recipients of the advertisement. The representation that $27,500 in cash was
available was likely false for many consumers.

Moreover, there was no way the consumer could obtain $27,500 in cash on
the same day as the advertisement, despite the representation that the cash
could be obtained âtoday.â

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented variable-
rate loans as âfixedâ rate loans.

For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 99,200 consumers in July
2016 used the word âfixedâ in bold font and capitalized letters next to the
advertised interest rate on the front, but in fine print on the back, indicated
that the advertised loan was, in fact, a variable-rate mortgage.

In these advertisements, the phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-
Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not appear before the first use of the word
âfixed,â nor was it at least as conspicuous as any use of the word âfixedâ in
the advertisements.

In these advertisements, each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or

payment was not accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
4).

42.

43.

44,

45.

proximate statement of the period for which the rate or payment would be
fixed and the fact that the rate may vary or the payment may increase after
that period.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
existence and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 99,200 consumers in July
2016 prominently featured the words âNO CLOSING COSTSâ on the front
page of the advertisements, in bold, capitalized letters, along with an
advertised APR of 2.75%.

But consumers could not obtain a loan from Prime Choice with an APR of
2.75% without paying closing costs. Therefore, in connection with the loan
that Prime Choice was advertising, the statement âNO CLOSING COSTSâ
was false.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements contained inaccurate
disclosures that misrepresented certain factors used to determine the variable
rate applicable to the advertised mortgage, including the applicable index,
margin, or rate-increase caps.

For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 84,000 people in October

2018 stated that the margin was fixed at 1.75%. That statement was false
46.

47.

48.

49.

50.

because the margin for the loans offered in those advertisements was in fact
2%.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27-45
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations Related to the
Consumerâs Finances or Qualification for the Advertised Loan

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
consumerâs likelihood of obtaining the advertised mortgage or a specific
credit term, including whether the consumer had been preapproved or
qualified for the advertised product or term.

For example, numerous Prime Choice advertisements stated that the
recipients of the advertisements had been âpre-selected for a U.S.
Department of Veteran Affairs programâ to obtain the advertised loan under
the terms stated in advertisement. But that statement was false because those
consumers had not actually been pre-selected for the advertised product or
the terms of that product.

In another example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 321,000 consumers

in November and December 2018, prominently labeled âURGENT
SI.

52.

53.

54.

NOTICE,â included a quote from forbes.com stating that the Federal
Reserve âexpects three or more rate increases in 2018â and stated: âBased
on our information, this WILL affect your monthly budget.â The
advertisements further stated: âYou have been preselected and already have
what it takes to qualifyâ for the advertised loan products. These statements
were misleading because Prime Choice did not have specific information
about the finances of the consumer and the recipients had not been
preselected.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements also contained misleading
comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the terms of the
advertised product.

Specifically, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 30,000
consumers in March 2018 made a comparison between a hypothetical
payment ($664) and interest rate (19.90%) for the consumerâs current debt,
and an advertised payment amount ($121) and interest rate (2.625% / 3.25%
APR) for the advertised loan.

The payment amount and interest rate for the advertised loan were not
available for the full period of the loan.

The advertisements did not include a clear and conspicuous comparison to

each simple interest rate that would apply over the term of the loan or the
55.

56.

57.

58.

amount of each payment that would apply over the term of the loan.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 48â54
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements falsely represented,
directly or by implication, through the use of formats, symbols, or logos that
resemble those of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that Prime Choice

was affiliated with the government or that the advertised product related to a
federal tax benefit, or was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the IRS.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 161,000 consumers
between June 2018 and January 2019 were formatted with text boxes that
strongly resembled an IRS form; were titled âLoan Review Notification |
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017â; and were labeled âForm 2017-1 Notification
of Eligibility,â using much larger font for the alleged form number (2017-
1)âa distinctive format used by the IRS. They also included the year
2017â printed in block letters with the â20â in white and the â17â in black,

another distinctive format used by the IRS.
59.

60.

61.

62.

63.

64.

In fact, Prime Choice was not affiliated with the government and the
products offered in these advertisements did not relate to any federal tax
benefits, nor were the products endorsed by, sponsored by, or affiliated with
the IRS.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 57â59
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About a Property Assessment
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented that the
advertisements contained property assessments, that the sender had
conducted or obtained a property assessment, and that the loan terms offered
in the advertisement were based on a property assessment.

Specifically, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 30,000
consumers in March 2018 were captioned âRE: Property Assessment,â and
featured a photograph of the recipientâs property. Both the caption and photo
were visible through the envelopes and on the face of the advertisements.
There was no other text on the outside of the envelopes to indicate that they
were, in fact, mortgage advertisements and were not directly related to a

property assessment of the property in question.
65.

66.

67.

68.

The net impression of the mailers, from the outside of the envelope, was that
they contained a property assessment or were a response to such an
assessment. As seen from the outside of the envelopes, these mailers were
likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances to
believe that the mailers contained or were in response to a property
assessment of the featured property.

Once the consumer opened the envelope, the contents of the enclosed
advertisement gave the net impression that Prime Choice had obtained an
assessment of the consumerâs property featured in the advertisement and that
the proposed loan terms were based on that assessment. The document title,
âRE: Property Assessment,â and the photograph of the property, both at the
top of the advertisement, were likely to mislead a consumer acting
reasonably under the circumstances to believe that Prime Choice had
obtained the property assessment or that the mailing was in response to an
assessment of this property, and that the loan terms promoted in the
advertisement were based on that assessment.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 62-66
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.
69.

70.

71.

72.

73.

Inadequate Disclosures
Most of Prime Choiceâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of
repayment, payment amount, finance charge, or simple annual rate of
interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d),
and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements.
Many of the advertisements did not include the other disclosures that are
required, or did not include them in the manner required.
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual
interest rate more conspicuously than the APR.
Specifically, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 99,600 consumers in
February 2017 stated a simple annual rate of 3.25% in bold font in the first
paragraph of the letter, and the APR was only stated in smaller, not-bolded
font elsewhere on the page.
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment or the amount of a payment, but failed to state the terms of
repayment reflecting the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 400,000
consumers in October 2017 stated a payment amount based on a discounted,

introductory rate of 2.25% that would apply for the first three years. After
74.

75.

the first three years, the rate would rise based on the applicable index and
margin, which was at least 2.96% as of the date of the advertisements. Thus,
higher monthly payments would apply for the remaining term of the loan,
but the advertisements did not state the number and period of the subsequent
payments and the amounts of those payments. The advertisements also failed
to state that the term of the advertised loan was 30 years.

Numerous Prime Choice advertisements for a mortgage loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of interest, but,
for variable-rate transactions, failed to state a rate determined by adding an
index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin; failed to
state the period during which each simple annual rate of interest would
apply; failed to state an accurate APR for the loan because the stated APR
was not correctly calculated under Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c)
and 1026.22; or failed to state these terms clearly and conspicuously.

As an example of the various deficiencies described in Paragraph 74, Prime
Choice advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to 137,000 people in
February 2018 stated an introductory annual rate of interest of 2.625% that

applied to the first three years of the advertised loan.
70.

77.

78.

79.

80.

81.

Although a variable rate applied to the remaining term of the loan, the
advertisements failed to state a rate determined by adding an index and
margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin.

The advertisements were dated February 15, 2018; the index during the 60-
day period before that date was at least 1.70%; the margin was 1.75%; and
thus the fully indexed rate, based on a reasonably current index and margin,
was at least 3.45%.

The advertisements did not state that rate, or any other rate determined by
adding an index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and
margin.

The only period stated in the advertisements was the initial three years; the
advertisements did not state the term of the loan or otherwise state the period
during which each simple annual rate of interest would apply.

Moreover, the APR disclosedâ2.99%âwas inaccurate. In fact, the APR for
the loans promoted in those advertisements was at least 3.26%. The APR
disclosed in the advertisements did not comply with the accuracy standards
set forth in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2).

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply

over the term of the loan (e.g., for adjustable-rate mortgages, payments
82.

83.

84.

based on the application of the sum of a reasonably current index and
margin); failed to state the period during which each payment would apply;
failed to state the fact that the advertised payments did not include amounts
for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation would be greater; or failed to state these terms clearly and
conspicuously.

As an example of the various deficiencies described in Paragraph 81, Prime
Choice advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to more than 16,000
consumers in November 2018 stated a payment amount that was based on a
discounted, introductory rate of 3.75%, which applied for the first five years.
That payment was not calculated based on the index and margin that would
be used to make subsequent payment adjustments over the remaining term of
the loan, and the advertisements failed to state such a payment amount.

As of the date of the advertisements, November 8, 2018, a reasonably
current index rate, based on the One-Year Constant Maturity Treasury rate,
was at least 2.53%, and the margin was fixed at 1.75%, making the fully
indexed rate at least 4.28%. Starting in year four, payments for the proposed
loan, based on the fully indexed rate, would be at least $580, not including
any applicable taxes and insurance premiums. No such payment amount was

stated in the advertisements.
85.

86.

87.

88.

89.

90.

Moreover, the advertisements failed to state, clearly and conspicuously, the
period during which each payment would apply.

In addition, the advertisements failed to state, clearly and conspicuously, that
the payments did not include amounts for taxes and insurance premiums, if
applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be greater.

In another example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 30,000
consumers in March 2018 stated a payment amount of $121, which was for
the advertised cash-out amount only and was based on a discounted,
introductory rate of 2.625%, which only applied for the first three years.
These advertisements failed to disclose subsequent payments after the initial
three years, failed to disclose the period in which each payment would

apply, failed to state the full payment amount, and failed to state that the
payment amounts did not include taxes and insurance premiums, if
applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be greater.

In addition, the advertisements failed to state, clearly and conspicuously, that
the advertised payment did not include amounts for taxes and insurance
premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be
greater.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements used the name of the

consumerâs current lender without disclosing with equal prominence the
91.

92.

93.

name of the person making the advertisement and without including a clear
and conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 358,000 consumers
between April and July 2016 stated the name of the consumerâs current
lender at the top of the advertisements, while Prime Choiceâs name appeared
only in small print on the back of the advertisements. The advertisements
also failed to include a clear and conspicuous statement that the person
making the advertisement was not associated with or acting on behalf of the
consumerâs current lender.
VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z

Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

Misleading Use of the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(1)
102. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(1), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the
credit transaction in an advertisement for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will
increase, unless:

(i) In the case of an advertisement solely for one or more
variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ
and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the
rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period;

(ii) In the case of an advertisement solely for non-variable-
rate transactions where the payment will increase (e.g., a
stepped-rate mortgage transaction with an initial lower
payment), each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to the payment
is accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the payment
is fixed, and the fact that the payment will increase after that
period; or

(iii) In the case of an advertisement for both variable-rate
transactions and non-variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement with equal prominence as any use of the
term âfixed,â âFixed-Rate Mortgage,â or similar terms;
and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate,
payment, or the credit transaction either refers solely to
the transactions for which rates are fixed and complies
with paragraph (1)(1)(ii) of this section, if applicable,
or, if it refers to the variable-rate transactions, is
accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the
rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the rate may
vary or the payment may increase after that period.

103. Prime Choice violated Â§ 1026.24(i)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs
37â40, numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements for variable-rate
transactions used the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the credit
transaction and did not comply with the requirements of Â§ 1026.24()(1)q)

Misleading Cost Comparisons, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(2)

104. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(2), mortgage advertisements may not:

Mak[e] any comparison . . . between actual or hypothetical
credit payments or rates and any payment or simple annual
rate that will be available under the advertised product for a
period less than the full term of the loan, unless:

(1) In general. The advertisement includes a clear and
conspicuous comparison to the information required to
be disclosed under Â§ 1026.24(f)(2) and (3); and
(ii) Application to variable-rate transactions. If the
advertisement is for a variable-rate transaction, and the
advertised payment or simple annual rate is based on
the index and margin that will be used to make
subsequent rate or payment adjustments over the term
of the loan, the advertisement includes an equally
prominent statement in close proximity to the payment
or rate that the payment or rate is subject to adjustment
and the time period when the first adjustment will
occur.

105. Prime Choice violated Â§ 1026.24(i)(2) because, as described in Paragraphs
51â54, numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements contained a
comparison between actual or hypothetical payments or rates and a payment
or simple annual rate that would be available under the advertised loan for a

Us[e] the name of the consumerâs current lender in an
advertisement that is not sent by or on behalf of the

(1) Discloses with equal prominence the name of the

specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific APRs, payment amounts,

If Respondent screens or selects consumers to receive any direct-mail
mortgage advertisements based on consumersâ credit scores or credit
tiers, those advertisements may only contain specific credit terms that
are available to consumers with a credit score equal to or less than the
credit score or credit tier that was used to identify the recipient
consumers.

In any direct-mail mortgage advertisement, if the advertisement states
an interest rate or APR that is available only to consumers whose
credit scores are above a threshold number, that fact (including the
applicable credit score threshold) must be disclosed Clearly and
Prominently on the same side of the advertisement as the advertised
interest rate or APR.

If a mortgage advertisement includes the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the
amount of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge, the

advertisement must also include, at a minimum:
The amount or percentage of the downpayment;

The term of the loan in either months, years, or number of
monthly payments;

The amount of each payment that will apply over the term of
the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be
disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;
The period during which each payment will apply;

The fact that the payments do not include amounts for taxes and
insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation will be greater;

The loan amount upon which the disclosures are based; and
The âannual percentage rate,â using that term, and, if the rate

may be increased after consummation, that fact.

In any direct-mail advertisement for an adjustable rate mortgage,

Respondent must:

State, Clearly and Prominently, that the product is an

âadjustable rate mortgage,â using those words. The
2020-BCFP-0006 Document1 Filed 07/24/2020 Page 46 of 64

advertisement may not use the term âhybridâ before the first use
of the phrase âadjustable rate mortgageâ;

For each simple annual rate of interest disclosed that is based
on an index and margin, base the rate on an index value in
effect on the date of the advertisement or within 60 days prior,
and disclose the index and margin; and

State that more information about adjustable rate mortgages is
available at https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201401_cfpb_

booklet_charm.pdf.

 

Any disclosure in a direct-mail mortgage advertisement that must be

made with âequal prominence and in close proximityâ under

Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24, must be:

1.

In the same type size as the advertised rates or payments
triggering the required disclosures;

Located immediately next to or directly above or below the
advertised rates or payments triggering the required disclosures,
without any intervening text or graphical displays; and

Otherwise compliant with Regulation Z, as applicable.

Advertising Review

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Respondent, whether acting directly or indirectly, must take the following

affirmative actions:

a. Respondentâs Advertising Compliance Official must review each
mortgage advertisement template before any advertisement based on
that template is disseminated to a consumer to ensure that it is
compliant with TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, the CFPA, and
this Consent Order. This review must encompass any envelope or
mailer and all enclosures. This review includes reviewing all claims
made in the advertisement, expressly or by implication, to ensure that
they are accurate and substantiated.

b. Before any set of direct-mail advertisements based on a template is
mailed to consumers, the Advertising Compliance Official must
review an Exemplar of those advertisementsâincluding any
envelope, mailer, and enclosuresâto ensure that it is compliant with
TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, the CFPA, and this Consent
Order. This includes reviewing all claims made in the advertisement,

expressly or by implication, to ensure that they are accurate and
substantiated. All specific credit terms stated in the Exemplar must be
available and based on a reasonably current index rate, if applicable,
at the time the advertisement is disseminated. This requirement
applies whether the set is mailed as a single batch or in multiple
batches. It also applies whether the set is mailed out at a single time or
over a period.

The Advertising Compliance Official must document in writing his or
her review of each advertisement template or Exemplar. That
documentation must include a copy of the advertisement, the date of
the review, and documents sufficient to substantiate all claims made
in the advertisement, expressly or by implication. If the advertisement
includes specific rates, that documentation must also include a rate
sheet showing the availability of the advertised rate(s). If the
advertisement states an APR, that documentation must include a copy
of a worksheet showing the calculation of the APR, including all
inputs assumed when calculating that number. If the advertisement
states an amount of cash that a borrower might receive, the
documentation must state the method of arriving at that number and
include any materials used to determine the availability of that

amount.
152.

153.

d. The Advertising Compliance Official and any employees with
responsibilities related to designing, developing, or approving the
content of Respondentâs mortgage advertisements must participate in
annual training on TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, and the CFPA,
as those laws apply to mortgage advertising.

VIII.
Compliance Plan

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Within 45 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must submit to the

Enforcement Director for review and determination of non-objection a

comprehensive compliance plan designed to ensure that Respondentâs

mortgage advertising complies with all applicable Federal consumer
financial laws and the terms of this Consent Order (Compliance Plan). The

Compliance Plan must include, at a minimum:

a. Detailed steps for addressing each action required by this Consent
Order; and
b. Specific timeframes and deadlines for implementation of the steps

described above.

The Enforcement Director will have the discretion to make a determination

of non-objection to the Compliance Plan or direct Respondent to revise it. If

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section V of this Consent Order, and taking
into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a
civil money penalty of $645,000 to the Bureau.
Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.
157.

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to
payment made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil
money penalty paid under this Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory

monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money

penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

X.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.
Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondent.
Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must

furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
163.

used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Enforcement
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that Respondent paid
or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of

consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Mortgage Companies to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

JUL 24, 2020

Washington, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued
consent orders against Sovereign Lending Group, Inc. (Sovereign) and Prime Choice
Funding, Inc. (Prime Choice). Sovereign is a California corporation that is licensed as a
mortgage broker or lender in about 44 states and the District of Columbia. Prime Choice is
a California corporation that is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 35 states
and the District of Columbia. Both companies offer and provide mortgage loans
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Their principal means
of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to
United States military servicemembers and veterans. The Bureau found that the companies
mailed consumers advertisements for VA-guaranteed mortgages that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or lacked required disclosures, in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and
practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices - Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z.
The consent orders require the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose
requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs actions stem from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple mortgage
companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages. The Bureau
commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful advertising in
the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising provides
consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and terms
available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This ongoing
sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure
the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Sovereign and Prime disseminated advertisements that contained
false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures.
For example, Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements misrepresented the credit terms
of the advertised mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually
prepared to offer to the consumer. Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements
misleadingly described an advertised introductory interest rate as a âfixedâ rate, when in fact
the rate was adjustable and could increase over time. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also created the false impression that they were affiliated with the
government by using words, phrases, images, or designs that are associated with the VA or
the Internal Revenue Service.

The Bureau also found that both Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements used the
name of the consumer's lender in a misleading way by not adequately disclosing their own
names and the fact that they were not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the
consumer's current lender, as required by Regulation Z. Sovereign advertisements made
false claims about consumer's existing loans, and falsely implied that the consumer could
address these problems by obtaining a loan from Sovereign. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit terms
for the advertised mortgage, such as the consumer's repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan and the period during which certain interest rates would apply. Further,
Prime Choice advertisements created the false impression that they contained a property
assessment as well as misleading comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the
terms of the advertised product.

The consent order against Sovereign requires Sovereign to pay a civil penalty of $460,000.
The consent order against Prime Choice requires Prime Choice to pay a civil penalty of
$645,000. The consent orders also impose injunctive relief to prevent future violations,
including requiring the companies to bolster their compliance functions by designating an
advertising compliance official who must review their mortgage advertisements for
compliance with mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting
misrepresentations similar to those identified by the Bureau; and requiring the companies
to comply with certain enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent them from making
future misrepresentations.

From at least 1999 through the end of 2012, Respondent purchased
consumer-debt accounts from debt brokers and placed the accounts for
collections with collections law firms in the states where the consumers were
located.
After Respondent placed the consumer-debt accounts with collections law
firms, the collections law firms sent the consumer debtors letters demanding
payment of the full past-due amounts, as well as interest and fees.
These demand letters were sent on law-firm letterhead, referenced the fact

that the firm has been âretainedâ for the âcollection of this debt.â And,

before litigation, the law firms offered opportunities to settle the consumersâ
accounts.

If consumers did not settle their accounts with Respondent in response to
these demand letters, Respondent sued on a majority of the accounts.

The vast majority of Respondentâs collections lawsuits resulted in default
judgments against non-appearing consumers. After securing these default
judgments, Respondent used judgment-enforcement mechanisms, including
writs of attachment, execution, and garnishment, to collect on the judgments.
Respondent stopped purchasing consumer debts in 2012 and filed its last
collections lawsuit without the licensure required by applicable state law in
August 2014. Since then, Respondent has administered a portfolio of
judgments that it obtained against consumers, as well as a handful of
stipulated payment agreements that it had entered into with debtors whose
accounts it had purchased.

For some or all of the Relevant Period, Respondent was required to be
licensed under the laws of the Subject States to recover payment of
consumer debts through the judicial process. But for some or all of the
Relevant Period, Respondent both threatened litigation and sued consumers

without the licensure required by law in the Subject States.

Findings and Conclusions as to the FDCPA Violations

The FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692 et seq., is a Federal consumer financial law
designed to eliminate abusive debt-collection practices, promote fair debt
collection, and provide consumers with an avenueto dispute and obtain
validation of debt information in order to ensure the informationâs accuracy.
The Bureau is empowered to enforce the FDCPA under its organic statute,
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5564(a)-(b), 5481(12)(H), (14).

The FDCPA applies to âdebt collectors,â which the Act defines alternatively
as those engaged âin any business the principal purpose of which is the
collection of any debtsâ andthose âwho regularly collect[]â debts âowed or
due another.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692a(6).

Respondent is subject to the FDCPA because the principal purpose of its
business is the collection of debts.

FDCPA Â§ 1692e(5) prohibits threats âtotake any action that cannot legally
be taken or that is not intended to be taken.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692e(5).

In dozens of instances during the Relevant Period, Respondent threatened to
sue or sued consumers whose debts it owned without the legal authority to
do so under Subject-State licensure laws.

Every demand Respondent made to Subject-State consumers without the

required licensure, whether through a demand letter referencing a
19.

conditional offer to settlethe account or a lawsuit, threatened a legal action
that Respondent had no authority to take. Each demandthus violated
FDCPA Â§ 1692e(5).
FDCPA Â§ 1692e(10) prohibits â[t |he use of any false representation or
deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain
information conceming aconsumer.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692e(10).
Every demand Respondent made of Subject-State consumers without the
required licensure, whether through a demand letter referencing a
conditional offer to settle the account or a lawsuit, falsely implied that
Respondent hada legally enforceable claim for payment from consumers
when it lacked any such legally enforceable claim. Each demand thus
violated FDCPA Â§ 1692e(10).

Findings and Conclusions as to CFPA Violations
CFPA Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A), 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), provides that it is
âunlawful for any covered person to offer or provide to a consumer any
financial product or service not in conformity with Federal consumer law, or
otherwise commit any act or omission in violation of a Federal consumer
financial law.â
Respondent is subject to this prohibition because it is a covered person

under the CFPA.
23.

24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

Respondent violated this prohibition when it violated the FDCPA
provisions set forth above.

CFPA Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036(a)(1)(B), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B),
prohibit covered person from engaging âin any unfair, deceptive, or abusive
act or practice.â

Respondent is subject to this prohibition because it is a covered person under
the CFPA.

An act or practice is deceptive under the CFPA if it misleads or is likely to
mislead a reasonable consumer, and the misrepresentation is material.
Respondentâs threats to sue and actual lawsuits on the Subject Accounts
during the Relevant Period implicitly represented that it had a legally
enforceable right to recover payment from consumers through the judicial
process when, in fact, its failure to adhere to applicable state-licensure laws
meant it had nosuch right.

These misrepresentations were material because a reasonable consumerâs
decision whether and howto respond to a demand letter or lawsuit would
likely be affected by their knowledge that the collector had no legal right to
payment on their accountthat could be enforced through the judicial

process.
29.

30.

31.

32.

2020-BCFP-0023 Documentâ Filed 12/08/2020 Page 11 of 24

These misrepresentations were thus false, misleading, and material, and

violated the CFPAâs prohibition against deceptive acts or practices.

IT IS ORDERED, under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, that:

Respondent, and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who

or assist others in misrepresenting, expressly or impliedly, that Respondent
has a legally enforceable right to recover the debt through the judicial
process. Respondent represents that its present members have actual notice
of this Consent Order and that it will deliver this Consent Order to any
future member(s) at or before the time of the transfer or acquisition of any

VI.

civil money penalty of $204,000 to the Bureau.

penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.
35.

36.

37.

Order as a penalty paid to the government for all purposes. Regardless of

how the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:

a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment
made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil money
penalty paid under this Consent Order.

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related

Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondentis entitled to,

nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory

monetary remedies imposed in any Related Consumer Action because of the

civil money penalty paid in this action. Ifthe court in any Related Consumer

Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary

remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money penalty paid

in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil

4].

Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry ofa final order
granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the amount of
the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be
considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the amount
of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.

Respondent relinquishes all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid to

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Debt Collector for Engaging in
Deceptive Debt Collection Practices in Three States

DEC 08, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against RAB Performance Recoveries, LLC (RAB) for threatening to sue and
suing consumers to collect debts where it did not have a legally required license to do so.
Through 2012, RAB, a New Jersey company, purchased and collected consumer debts from
debt brokers, and through August 2014, it used collections law firms to obtain judgments
against consumers. RAB has continued to collect on those judgments against consumers as
well as on a handful of payment agreements it obtained from debtors. The Bureau found
that during the period that RAB was obtaining judgments against consumers, RAB
threatened to sue, sued, and demanded payment from consumers in Connecticut, New
Jersey, and Rhode Island even though RAB did not hold the licenses that those states
required to sue to collect debts. Thus, RAB was not legally entitled to take the actions that it
threatened to take against consumers in those states. The Bureau found that RAB
misrepresented that it had a legally enforceable right to recover payments from consumers
in these states through the judicial process in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA).

The consent order prohibits RAB from collecting on the judgments against, or payment
agreements from, consumers it obtained in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island
when RAB did not hold a required debt-collection license in those states. It also requires
RAB to take all necessary steps to vacate those judgments and suspend collection of those
judgments and to notify consumers with payment agreements that they have been satisfied.
The consent order also requires RAB to pay a $204,000 civil money penalty.

A copy of the consent order is available at:

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau findsthe following:

4. Respondent is aspecialized consumer finance company headquartered
in Fort Worth, Texas. [ts primary business is the indirect origmation of retail
installment contracts and vehicle leases through manufacturer-atfiliated dealers or
large, independent dealers. In 2019, Respondent reported $31.3 billion in
originations across vehicle retail installment contracts and leases, and it reported
$994 million in net income.

5.  Respondentis aâcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481{6).

6. Respondent fumishes consumer credit information to CRAs and is
therefore subject to the FCRA and Regulation V. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681 et seq.; 12
C.F.R. pt. 1022.

7. Respondent furnishes consumer information onthe vehicle retail
installment contracts and leases it services by sending monthly data files to CRAs
using a data format called Metro 2. Each line of consumer data relating to one
individual credit account is commonly known as a tradeline, and each tradeline can
be composed of more than 40 data fields, such as the consumerâs name, thetype of

account, andthe status ofthe account.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Furnishing of Information
That It Knew or Had Reasonable Cause to Believe Was Inaccurate

8. From at least January 2016 to at least August 2019, Respondent
furnished consumer information to CRAs that contained systemic errors. In many
instances, the errors should have been readily apparent because the data for certain

accounts was internally inconsistent.

9. | Moreover, Respondent received error reports from at least one CRA
that described these errors in the companyâs data files. In addition, Respondentâs
internal audits show that it was aware of at least one of these errors as of 2016.
Despite being on notice of these errors, Respondent continued to make them for

years.

10. Several of Respondentâs errors related to its use of the Date of First

Delinquency (DOFD) field in its furnishing data.

11. Section 605(a)(5) ofthe FCRA requires that negative information
such as late payments must be removed from a consumerâs credit report afterthat
information is seven years old. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681(a)(5). The date by which such
information must be removed is determined by the date on which the account first
became delinquentâthe âdate of first delinquency.â This provision allows

consumers to rebuild their credit following a long period of delinquency.
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 6 of 31

Reporting an Incorrect Date of First Delinquency

 

12. Inmore than 23 million instances between January 2016 and August
2019, or 35 percent of all instances when Respondent furnished a DOFD during
this time period, the DOFD furnished by Respondent equaled the Date of Account
Information (DOAI) for the account. The DOAT is the date on which Respondent

pulled information from its system of record each month in order to sendto CRAs.

13. When fumishing in the Metro 2 format, furnishers like Respondent
must provide the DOAI so that date is updated each month until the company stops
reporting on atradeline. Even ifthe DOFD did equal the DOAT at one point fora
particular account, it is extremely unlikely that the DOFD would equal the DOAI

for two or more months.

14. A CRA informed Respondent that it was reporting DOFDs that were
more recent than previously reported DOFDs on derogatory accounts --an error
that couldresult from usingthe DOAI in the DOFD field. Respondent received
these reports from January 2015 through June 2016 and again in December 2017

and early 2019.

15. In morethan 22 million instances when Respondent reported a DOFD
that equaled the DOAI, the company also reported that the accounts were current.

DOFD should not typically be reported for current accounts. Respondent knew
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 7 of 31

about this issue since at least September 2016, when an internal audit showed that
the company reported DOFDs on current accounts. In November 2016, another

internal audit showed thesame error.

16. Inalmost 450,000 ofthe instances when Respondentreported a
DOFD that equaled the DOAI, the com pany also reported an account status
showing a serious delinquency (e.g., account was charged-off or at least 90 days
delinquent, or the vehicle was already repossessed). The DOAI is typically close in
time to the date of furnishing because account information is ordinarily pulled for
furnishing purposes shortly before it is transmitted to CRAs. By contrast, it would
be extremely unusual to have a DOFD close to the date of furnishing on a seriously

delinquent account.
Reporting a Date of First Delinquency for Accounts that Were Not Delinquent

17. In at least an additional 890,700 instances between January 2016 and
August 2019, Respondent reported a DOFD at the same time it reported
contradictory information suggesting that the accounts in question were not in fact
delinquent. Respondent should not havereported DOFDs for accounts that were
current, paid in full (and not delinquent immediately beforehand), or previously
delinquent but subsequently became current. If, on the other hand, the DOFD was
accurate and the accounts referenced above were delinquent, then Respondent

should not have reported them as current, paid in full, or cured. Either way,

7
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 8 of 31

Respondent fumished incorrect information for each of these tradelines.

Reporting Other Types of Inaccurate Information

 

18. Respondent also furnished inconsistent information regarding whether
accounts were open or closed and whether consumers were carrying a balance or
obligated to make future payments. To the extent that the com pany inaccurately
reported whether accounts were open or closed or that consumers owed money that
they did not actually owe, these errors could have negatively impacted consumersâ

credit scores and access to credit.

19. For example, in at least 367,070 instances between January 2016 and
August 2019, Respondent furnished information indicating that accounts were
âpaid in full, charged off,â along with contradictory information suggesting the
tradelines were still open. The company received error reports from a CRA
highlighting this inconsistency from January 2015 through June 2016 and again in

December 2017 and early 2019.

20. Respondent also reported in approximately 250,000 instances that
accounts had a current balance and simultaneously furnished contradictory
information, such as also furnishing information indicating that the accounts were
paid in full. The company had received error reports from a CRA since January

2015 advising of this error.

21. Priorto June 2017, Respondent did not consistently, for all tts retail
installment contract and lease portfolios, clearly and conspicuously specify to
consumers an address where consumers could notify the com pany that information

the company furnished was inaccurate.

22. Section 623(a)(1 (A) of FCRA prohibits a furnisher from fumishing
any information relatmeg to a consumer to any CRA if it knows or has reasonable

cause to believe that the information 1s inaccurate. 15 U.S.C.$ 1681s-2(a)C1 WA).

23. Innumerous instances, Respondent fumished consumer credit
information to CRAs that contained inaccurate information about consumersâ
credit accounts.

24. Inmany instances, Respondent knew or had reasonable cause to
believe that the information was inaccurate because this information was internally
inconsistent. In many other instances, the company furnished a DOFD that equaled
the DOAT, which was extremely unlikely to be accurate for tradelines furnished
over multiple months for multiple accounts. Moreover, the company continued to
furnish this inaccurate information even alterit had been notified about these types
of errors by CRAs.

25. Therefore, priorto June 2017, Respondent violated Â§ 623(a)(1 (A) of

the FCRA, 15 U.S.C.$ 1681s-2(a)C1 (A).

o
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 10 of 31

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Failure to
Promptly Update and Correct Inaccurate Information

26. Section 623(a)(2) of FCRA requires fumishers to promptly update and
correct information they have furnished to a CRA that they determine is not

complete or accurate. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(2).

27. As detailed above, in numerous instances from at least January 2016

to at least August 2019, Respondent furnished to CRAs information relating to

consumers that was not complete or accurate.

28. Inmany instances, Respondent furnished information that was
inconsistent with its internal account information and inaccurate. In many other
instances, Respondent furnished a DOFD that equaled the DOAI, which was
extremely unlikely to be accurate for tradelines furnished over multiple months for

multiple accounts.

29.  Inaddition, Respondent received multiple error reports from at least

one CRA that allowed it to determinethat the information it furnished was not
complete or accurate, and Respondentâs internal audits showed at least oneof the

errors listed above.

30. Despite this knowledge, Santander did not promptly update or correct

the incomplete or inaccurate information it furnished. To the contrary, in many

10
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 11 of 31

cases Santander continued reporting inconsistent information for years after being

alerted to its errors.

31. Therefore, Santander violated section 623(a)(2) of the FCRA, 15

U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(2).
Findings and Conclusions as to Failing to Reporta DOFD

32. In at least 9,730 instances between January 2016 and August 2019,
Respondent failed to report a DOFD, leaving this field blank, when it reported
other information indicating that the accounts were more than 120 days delinquent
or had been charged off. This error could have caused incorrect delinquency
information to remain on aconsumerâs credit report for longer than it should, and,
in turn, this could potentially result in another credit report user charging a higher

cost of credit or denying credit to an affected consumer.

33. From January 2015 through June 2016 and again in December 2017
and early 2019, a CRA sent Respondent monthly error reports showing that the
company was not always reporting DOFDs when it reported other information

indicating that the accounts were delinquent.

34. Despite this information, through at least August 2019, Respondent
continued to fail to furnish DOFDs while also furnishing information indicating

that the accounts had been placed for collection, charged-off, subject to similar

11
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 12 of 31

action, or were at least 120 days delinquent (which is a typical time period for

moving an account to collection and charge-off).

35. Section 623(a)(5)(A) of the FCRA requires that an entity providethe
DOFD for any account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected
to any similar action. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5)(A). Thus, when Respondent failed

to report a DOFD in the 9,730 instances cited above, Respondent violated section

623(a)(5)(A) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5)(A).
Findings and Conclusions as to Deficient Policies and Procedures

36. Respondent failed to establish and implement reasonable written
policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information
relating to consumers that it furnished to CRAs. In 2016, Respondentâs policies
and procedures did not require employees to add information required in the Metro
2 file after the company sold accounts to another company. When furnishers like

Respondent sell accounts, they are required to identify the purchaser.

37. Respondent submitted Metro 2 correction files for at least some
accounts that it sold. But at least 89,400 of these correction files improperly

omittedthe name ofthe account purchaser.

12

38. Until2018, Respondent did not have any written policies or
procedures requiring employees to update its internal records concerning consumer

accounts after it determmed that the internal records contamed errors.

39. When afurnisherlike Respondent determines there is an error in one
of its tradelines, it is required to correct and update the information previously

furnished.

40. For those who furnish to the national CRAs, this task is accom plished
by submitting changesto the CRAs. Simultaneously, the furnisher must correct its
internal records to ensurethat it does not send a file with the same error the next
month. Respondent had no written policies or procedures requiring its employees
to make these changes.

Al. Respondent was aware that its credit reporting policies and procedures
contained important misstatements and deficiencies. In 2016, for example, an
internal audit found that âwritten procedures do not exist that would govern daily
reporting activities within the | Credit Bureau Reporting] department.â

42. Another2016 audit foundthat Respondentâs policies and procedures

were ânot sufficientâ and pointed out specific gaps in the companyâs procedures.

MPI TRO PPT at LAPEER Ek cal PS kb Od

43. Thesame audit also noted that Respondent had no training for
electronically submitting consumer datato the CRAs or protocols to measure

whether such information was successfully transmittedto CRAs.

44. Regulation V requires furnishers to âestablish and implement
reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of
the information relating to consumers that it furnishes to a consumer reporting
agency.â LZ2C.FLR. Â§ 1022.42(a). The policies and procedures must be appropriate
to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisherâs activities. 12 C.F.R.Â§
1022.42(a).

45. Regulation V requires that furnishersâ policies and procedures should
address establishing and implementing internal controls for accuracy and integrity
of information about consumers furnished to CRAs; training staff that furnishes
information; providing appropriate and effective oversight of service providers;
deleting, updating, and correcting information in the furnisherâs records, as
appropriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate information; designing appropriate
technology to communicate with CRAs; and conducting a periodic evaluation of its
practices.

46. Between 2016 and 2018, Respondent failed to establish and
im plement reasonable written policies and procedures that related to the accuracy

and integnty of the consumer information it was furnishing to CRAs. Respondentâs

14
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 15 of 31

written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the
consumer information that it furnishes to CRAs were inadequate given the high
volumeand complexity of Respondentâs furnishing activities and were not
reasonable or appropriate given the nature, size, complexity, and scope of
Respondentâs activities.

47. Therefore, Respondent violated Regulation V by failing to establish
and implementthe required reasonable written policies and procedures, 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1022.42(a).
Findings and Conclusions as to the Consumer Financial Protection Act

48. UndertheCFPA, acovered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules thereunder,
violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).

49. The FCRA and Regulation V are Federal consumer financial laws.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Santander Consumer USA Inc.
for Credit Reporting Violations in Connection with Its Auto Loans

DEC 22, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Santander Consumer USA Inc. (Santander) to address the Bureau's
finding that it violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The consent order was issued in
connection with Santander providing erroneous consumer loan data to consumer reporting
agencies (CRAs). Santander, a subsidiary of Banco Santander S.A., is a leading originator
and servicer of nonprime auto loans and leases. Santander furnishes credit information on
the auto loans it services by sending monthly data files to CRAs. The Bureau found that the
consumer loan data Santander furnished to CRAs between January 2016 and August 2019
contained many systemic errors that in many instances, could have negatively impacted
consumersâ credit scores and access to credit. The consent order requires Santander to take
certain steps to prevent future violations and imposes a $4,750,000 civil money penalty.

The Bureau found that Santander furnished consumer loan information to CRAs that it knew
or reasonably should have known was inaccurate, including failing to furnish accurate
information regarding whether accounts were open or closed and whether consumers were
carrying a balance or obligated to make future payments. The Bureau found that Santander
failed to promptly update and correct information it furnished to CRAs that it later
determined was incomplete and failed to provide the date of first delinquency on certain
delinquent or charged-off accounts. The Bureau further found that Santander failed to
establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the
accuracy and integrity of information provided to CRAs. Santanderâs conduct violated the
FCRA and its implementing regulation, Regulation V. Further, these violations of the FCRA
and Regulation V constituted violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.

Under the terms of the consent order, Santander must correct all inaccuracies and errors
that the Bureau identified and take certain steps to improve and ensure the accuracy of the
consumer information it provides to CRAs. These steps include conducting monthly reviews
of account information to assess the accuracy and integrity of information Santander
furnishes. Santander must also establish and implement reasonable policies and

procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information it furnishes to CRAs.

Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. $ 1026.2(a)(22), and the MAP Rule, 12 C.FLR. Â§
1014.2, because it is a corporation.

Durmg the Relevant Period, Service Isthas beena âcovered personâ under

financial product(s] or service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(S), (6),
(15 )CA)G).
During the Relevant Period, Service Ist has been subject to the MAP Rule

because it is a person over which the Federal Trade Commission has

12 C.PLR.$ 1014.1. The MAP Rule is a Federal consumer financial law. 12
U.S.C, Â§ 548104).

Service Ist provides âmortgage credit product/s|,â as that term is defined in
the MAP Rule. 12 C.F_BR. Â§ 1014.2.

Service Istâs mortgage advertisements are âcommercial communicationsâ
regarding a term of a âmortgage credit product,â as those terms are defined
m i2CLPLR. Â§ 1014.2.

During the Relevant Period, Service Ist has offered âclosed-end creditâ in
the form of mortgage loans to âconsumers,â as those terms are defined in
Regulation 7. 12 CLR LR. Â§ 1026.2(a)010) & C1).

Service Ist offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by

the VA.

Service Istâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, mcludmg veterans
and servicemembers.
Since December 2015, Service Ist has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in at least 12 states.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of Service
istâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have obtamed
mortgages through Service Ist.
False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Service Ist was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemimation of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

Faise, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations About Cost
Most of Service Istâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,

such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and payment amount.

By stating specrfic credit terms in its advertisements, Service Ist
represented, expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a
mortgage with those credit terms.

In fact, Service Ist did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific
credit terms stated in many of those advertisements. While the advertised
introductory interest rate was available, the advertised APR was not.

In numerous instances, Service Ist misrepresented the actual credit terms
appheable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

About 134,000 of the advertisements that Service Ist sentin 2018 described
mortgages with a simple imterest rate and APR combination that, on the date
of the advertisement and im the GO days preceding, Service Ist was not
actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, in January 2018, Service Ist advertised an adjustable-rate
mortgage with a of 2.25% introductory rate and an APR of 2.61%,

But Service [st did not offer such a loan, as reflected in the rate sheets of its
lenders. While the advertised introductory interest rate was available, the
advertised APR was not.

Accordingly, Service Ist misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in

these advertisements.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27-30
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtamme a loan.

False and Misleading Representations
Relating to Cost Comparisons

Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements also contamed misleading
comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the terms of the
advertised product.

Specifically, Service Ist sent advertisements to more than 250,000
consumers between December 2016 to January 2017 that made a
comparison between a hypothetical payment amount for the consumerâ s
current debt and an advertised payment amount for the advertised loan.
The payment amount tor the advertised loan was not available for the full
term of the loan and the advertisement did not reveal this fact.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 33-35
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaming a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Notwithstanding that the name âService Istâ appeared in all the
advertisements, numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements falsely
represented, directly or by implication, from various formats and phrases,
that Service Ist was affilhated with the government, including the VA, that
the advertised product was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the
United States government, or that the United States government was the
source of the advertisement. Though many of the advertisements contained a
disclaimer that Service Ist was not affiliated with a government agency, the
disclaimer was in fine print at the bottom of the advertisement or on the
second page of the advertisement.
The disclaimer was not sufficient to dispel the false net impression created
by the advertisement when viewed as a whole.
For example, each of about 3.3 million Service Ist advertisements sent to
servicemembers and veterans between December 2015 and January 2018
contained the following statements:
a. âTIRRRLâBenefit Allotmentâ or âIRRRLâ1003 Benefit Allotmentâ
positioned in the upper-left corner of the advertisement, followed by
âForm 21-0760 Eligibility Notificationâ on the second line, which

also appeared through the window of the envelope;

False and Misleading Representations
Aboutan Escrow Refund Amount

About 1.9 milion of the advertisements Service Ist sent between April
2016 and May 2017 stated that a recipient will receive an âEST. ESCROW
REPUND AMOUNTâ of aspecific amount if that consumer refinances his
or her mortgage.

The escrow refund amounts that Service Ist advertised were calculated
using a methodology that had no bearing on the actual escrow refund
amount.

Moreover, for at least the advertised cash-out refinance loans, if the
purported escrow refund was provided as cash to the borrower at the

time of the refinance, Service Ist then added it to the principal

balance of the new loan.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 46â

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

False Representations About Skipping Loan Payments

Service Ist sent about 900,000 advertisements between December 2015 and
Apri 2017 representing that a consumer can â[s|kip two paymentsâ or
âmissâ two payments by refmancing with the company.

For example, Service Ist sent a mailer in June 2016 advertising that if a
consumer refinanced, âthe VA would allow you to skip the payments for
July and August and receive a full escrow refund. By havinga VA loan, you
are quahfied for this program.â

But consumers had the option of âskippingâ or âmissingâ two payments
only if specific timing requirements were met. Service Ist did not disclose
this Imitation mits advertisements.

Service Ist would then add the purported âskippedâ or âmissedâ paymenis
to the principal balance of the mortgage, which it also failed to disclose in
its advertisements.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 51â
54 were likely to have been misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaming a loan.

False Representations About the
Time-Limited Availability of the VA-Loan Program

About 1.i milhon of the advertisements Service Ist sent stated: âthe
Economic Stimulus Program will end soon. There is currently no plan to
extend the Stimulus Program.â
This statement regarding the purported time-limited availabilty of the
VA loan program was untrue.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 57
and 58 were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaming a loan.

inadequate Disclosures
Many of Service Istâs mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a new
loan payment and an introductory interest rate for adjustable mortgages.
Under certam sections of Regulation 7, mcluding Â§ 1026.24(d), and (1), the
use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements. About 1.6
milion of Service Istâs advertisements included these trigger terms, but did
not include the disclosures required by Â§ 1026.24(d), and about 134,000 of
its advertisements included these trigger terms, but did not include the

disclosures required by Â§ 1026.24G)(2).
In addition, about 1.8 milhon of Service Istâs mortgage advertisements
stated the name of the consumerâs current lender, but did not include the
additional disclosures required by Regulation Z in Â§ 1026.24G0)(4).
Disclosures Triggered by Payment Amount
Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements stated the amount of the
new loan payment, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the
recipient's repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, as required
by Â§ 1026.24).
For example, Service Ist sent about 1.6 millon advertisements to consumers
stating a ânew principal and interest paymentâ reflecting a new monthly
payment amount.
But these advertisements cid not state the period of the loan or the number
of required payments. Moreover, the payment amount advertised was
applicable for only the first three or five years of the loan, but the
advertisements did not disclose the subsequent payments required over the

Three milion of Service Istâs advertisements also failed to disclose in a

over the term of the loan, the period of time during which each payment
would apply, and the fact, apphcable to these loans, that the payments did
not include amounts for taxes and insurance premiums and that the actual
payment obligation would be greater, as required by Â§ 1026.24((3).
For example, the advertisements provided the amount of the recipientâs new
monthly payment, but included neither the amount of each payment that
would apply over the life of the loan (despite it being an adjustable rate
mortgage), nor the period during which cach payment would apply.
Furthermore, the advertisements failed to disclose that the advertised
payment amounts excluded taxes and insurance and that the actual payment
obhgation would be greater.

Disclosures Triggered by Introductory Interest Rate
Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements offering a loan for which
more than one interest rate would apply included a simple annual rate of
interest, but failed to clearly and conspicuously state each sumple annual
mterest rate that would apply, the period of ime during which each simple
annual interest rate would apply, and for variable-rate loans, an APR that

For example, Service ist sent about 134,000 advertisements for a variable-
rate mortgage to consumers offermg an introductory annual rate of interest
that would apply for the first three or five years of the loan, but that did not
disclose each simple interest rate that would apply over the remaining term
of the loan. These advertisements also stated the period for the introductory
rateâthree or five yearsâbut not the twenty-seven or twenty-five-year term
for the fully-indexed rate.
In addition, about 134,000 advertisements sent to consumers in January
2018 offered a mortgage with a 2.25% imtroductory interest rate that applied
to the first three years of the loan and a 2.61% APR. In fact, the lowest APR
that would have been available from Service Istâs lenders within 60 days
before any day m January 201% for the loans promoted in those
advertisements was at least 3.388%, which was not within the accuracy
standards in 8Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22. While the advertised introductory

Disclosures Triggered by Current Lender Name
Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements used the name of the

equal prominence, or to include a clear and conspicuous statement that
Service Ist was not associated with, or advertising on behalf of, the

i specific timing requirements were met, which Service Ist did not disclose

failed to disclose in its advertisements.

119. Service istâs misrepresentations about skipping two payments were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances,

iZ0. Service Istâs misrepresentations about skipping two payments were material
because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers,

121. Therefore, Service Ist engaged im deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CEPA, 12 U.S.C. $8 5531 (a), $536(a)(1)B).

Deceptive Representations About the
âTume-Limited Availability ofthe VA Loan Program

122, In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 57 and 58, Service Istâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that the
VA loan program that Service ist generated its loans under would be ending
SOON.

123. In fact, there was no deadline for applying for a VA-guaranteed loan, and the
VA-suaranteed loan program had no end date.

124, Service istâs misrepresentations about the time-limited availability of the
VA loan program was likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under

the circumstances.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Sixth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

SEP 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Service 1st Mortgage, Inc. (Service 1st), a mortgage broker based in
Glen Burnie, Maryland that is licensed in about 12 states. Service 1st offers and provides
mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Service 1st's principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail
advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers and veterans. The
Bureau found that in advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages Service 1st sent consumers
numerous mailers that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked
required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practicesâ
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires Service 1st to
pay a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the sixth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.
The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of investigations
reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the financial

marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers, veterans, and
surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that, since December 2015, Service 1st disseminated advertisements that
contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required
disclosures. For example, Service 1st advertised specific credit terms, such as APRs and
hypothetical payment amounts that it was not prepared to offer, or that it could only offer
for an introductory period but advertised as if they were permanent loan terms. Service 1st
also used terms in millions of its advertisements that falsely represented or implied that
Service 1st was affiliated with the government, including the VA, that the advertised product
was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the United States government, or that the
United States government was the source of the advertisements. In addition, in
advertisements mailed between April 2016 and May 2017, Service 1st stated that it would
pay an estimated escrow refund of a specific amount if the consumer refinanced through
Service 1st, even though the advertised escrow refund amount was calculated using a
method that would not yield an actual estimate for that consumer, and in cash-out
transactions the ârefundâ was actually added to the principal of the consumer's loan.

Service 1st also sent advertisements between December 2015 and April 2017 representing
that a consumer could â[s]kip two paymentsâ or âmissâ two payments by refinancing with the
company, but it did not disclose the limitations on this option, or that the skipped or missed
payments would be added to the principal balance of the consumer's loan. Its
advertisements also stated: âthe Economic Stimulus Program will end soon. There is
currently no plan to extend the Stimulus Program,â which was untrue. Finally, many Service
1st advertisements included claims or terms that require additional disclosures, but Service
1st failed to make these disclosures.

The consent order against Service 1st requires it to pay a civil penalty of $230,000. The
consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including requiring
Service 1st to bolster its compliance functions by: (1) designating an advertising compliance
official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage
advertising laws prior to the dissemination of the advertisements; (2) prohibiting
misrepresentations similar to those the Bureau found it has made; and (3) requiring it to
comply with certain enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent future
misrepresentations.

In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

Seterus, Inc. and
Kyanite Services, Inc., as the
successor in interest to Seterus, Inc.

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed the
servicing practices of Seterus, Inc. (Seterus) relating to loss mitigation applications
and has identified the following law violations. First, Seterus has committed unfair
acts or practices by failing to accurately review, process, track, and communicate
to borrowers information regarding their applications for loss mitigation options.
Second, Seterus has committed deceptive acts or practices by sending loss
mitigation application acknowledgment notices that misrepresented the status of
borrower application documents as received or missing and provided inaccurate
due dates for submission of borrower application documents. Third, Seterus has
violated the provisions relating to loss mitigation procedures in Regulation X, 12

C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41, the implementing regulation of the 2013 Real Estate Settlement

Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2601, et seg., by (1) sending
acknowledgment notices that failed to state the additional documents and
information borrowers needed to submit to complete their loss mitigation
applications; (2) failing to provide areasonable due date for submission of
borrower documents; (3) failing to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining
documents and information necessary to complete borrowersâ loss mitigation
applications; (4) failing to properly evaluate borrowers who submitted complete
loss mitigation applications for all loss mitigation options available to the
borrower; and (5) failing to treat certain applications as âfacially completeâ when
required under Regulation X. Fourth, because Regulation X is a Federal consumer
financial law, Seterusâs violations of Regulation X also constitute violations of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1 (A).
Under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues
this Consent Order (Consent Order) against Seterus and Kyanite Services, Inc., as

IV.
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

During the Relevant Period, Seterus was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kyanite. Seterus maintained its principal place of business in Raleigh, North
Carolina.

As of February 28, 2019, Seterus was sold, including all rights and certain
liabilities, to Purchaser.

At its height, Seterus serviced approximately 500,000 residential mortgage
loans. Respondent has represented that it is no longer engaged in servicing
mortgage loans.

At all times during the Relevant Period, Respondent was a âcovered person,â
as that term is defined by 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), because as a residential

mortgage servicer, it offered or provided a consumer financial product or

service. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(15)(A)(i).
10.

Regulation X requires, among other things, that a mortgage servicer that
offers loss mitigation options implement processes that: (1) inform borrowers
of the documents and information they must provide to complete the
application; (11) provide borrowers a reasonable dateto submit the documents
and information necessary to complete the application; (111) evaluate complete
applications received early enough in the foreclosure process for all
alternatives to foreclosure available to the borrower; and (iv) provide certain
foreclosure protections to borrowers who complete an application by certain
points in the foreclosure process. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41.

A servicer must provide a written notice to the borrower within five days of
receipt ofa loss mitigation application acknowledging that the servicer has
received the application and stating that the servicer has determined that the
application is either complete or incomplete. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(2)(1)(B).
If the application is incomplete, this (b)(2) Notice must also inform the
borrower of the additional documents and information that the borrower must
submit anda reasonable date by which they should be submitted to make the
application complete. /d. at Â§$ 1024.41(b)(2)(1)(B), 1024.41(b)(2)(11).

Once aservicer receives all the information it requires from the borrower to
evaluatethe application, the application is âcomplete.â 12 C.F.R. Â§

1024.41(b)(1).
11.

12.

13.

2020-BCFP-0024 Document1 Filed 12/18/2020 Page 12 of 45

If a servicer receives a âcompleteâ application within certain specified time
periods before a borrowerâs scheduled foreclosure sale, the servicer must
evaluatethe borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower
and must provide the borrower with certain foreclosure protections. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)(G), (f(2), & (g).
If the borrower has submitted all of the documents and information requested
by the (b)(2) Notice, or the servicer does not seek additional documents in the
(b)(2) Notice, the application is âfacially complete.â 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1024.41(c)(2)(iv). A borrower with a âfacially completeâ application is
entitledto the same protections from foreclosure actions as a borrower witha
âcompleteâ application, even iftheservicer later discovers it needs additional
information or that the borrower must make corrections to a previously
submitted document. /d.

Seterus Failed to Accurately Review, Process, Track, and

Communicate to Borrowers Information Regarding Their Applications
for Loss Mitigation.

 

 

 

As part of its efforts to comply with Regulation X, Seterus made the decision
to issue Acknowledgment Notices in response to any document received from
a consumer that may be in support of a loss mitigation application, in order to
assist the consumer in the loss mitigation process. Seterus also automated its

loss mitigation application and Acknowledgment Notice process, including its
14.

processes for tracking documents submitted by borrowers and populating and
generating the Acknowledgment Notices.

To facilitate that automation, and to try to meet the five-day requirement in 12
C.F.R. 1024.41(b)(2)(1)(B), Seterus contracted with a third-party vendorto
process all borrower documents submitted as part ofa loss mitigation
application.

Upon receipt ofa Triggering Document, the third-party vendor would
electronically capture an image of the document and âbrandâ the imaged
document by electronically tagging the document with the loan number, an
index code corresponding to the document type, a unique identifier for that
specific document, and the date the document was scanned directly on the
document and then upload the scanned document to Seterusâs internal
systems.

After uploading a Triggering Document to Seterusâs internal systems, the
third-party vendor would then electronically extract and validatethe data and
text from the image of the Triggering Document and transmit that data to
Seterusâs internal systems.

Seterusâs personnel wrote code for various computer software to ensure that
the third-party vendorâs computer system could communicate and share data

with Seterusâs internal loss mitigation and mortgage servicing computer

systems, andthat Seterusâs internal systems could communicate and share
data with one another.

Seterusâs Acknowledgment Notices provided consumers with a list of
documents Seterus had received and their expiration dates (âDocuments we
have receivedâ), anda list of documents Seterus still needed to evaluate the
application (âDocuments still neededââ).

Seterusâs Acknowledgment Notices also provided a date by which the
borrower needed to retum any missing documents and informed the borrower
that the due date provided was based on the earliest ofa set of milestones: (1)
the date on which the documents expire; (2) the 120"" day of delinquency; (3)
90 days prior to the foreclosure sale date, if any; or (4) 38 days prior to the
foreclosure sale date (ifthe application was made within 90 days of a
foreclosure sale date).

Seterus populated the fields in the Acknowledgment Notice that provided the
âDocuments we have received,â âDocuments still needed,â and due dates for
documents the borrower still needed to submit using the data its third-party
vendor extracted from the documents submitted by the borrower.

Seterusâs third-party vendor made numerous errors in branding, coding and
extracting data from borrower documents, and Seterus used that inaccurate

data to populate these fields in the Acknowledgment Notice.

Further, the coding on which Seterus relied to ensure its internal systems were
communicating properly with each other and with the third-party vendorâs
system was not always correct, which led to further such errors.

As aresult of its relianceon this inaccurate data and coding and the faulty
communication between various com puter systems, Seterus sent out
thousands of Acknowledgment Notices that contained one or more errors.
Certain Acknowledgment Notices inaccurately listed documents that Seterus
had received as missing, inaccurately listed documents that had not been
received as having been received, or both. This included Acknowledgment
Notices that did not request additional documents even when required
documents were missing and Acknowledgment Notices informing borrowers
that their loss mitigation applications were âcompleteâ or âfacially completeâ
when required documents were missing.

Seterus also sent numerous Acknowledgment Notices that provided no due
date; inaccurate due dates, such as dates that were the same date or prior to the
date that the Acknowledgment Notice was sent; or unreasonable due dates,
such as dates on or after the foreclosure sale date.

Further, despite its express representations in the Acknowledgment Notices

that the due date was not after the date when previously submitted documents

would expire, Seterus sent Acknowledgment Notices that provided due dates
that were after the date when previously submitted documents would expire.
The unreasonable due dates in Seterusâs Acknowledgment Notices also
rendered other statements in the Acknowledgment Notices inaccurate. For
example, in certain instances Seterus sent Acknowledgment Notices that
provided a due date that was just one or two days before the borrowerâs
scheduled foreclosure sale date. Seterus represented that as long as the
borrower provided the documents by the date indicated, he or she would be
evaluated for loss mitigation, but that representation was not always correct
when the due date was not sufficiently in advance of the scheduled foreclosure
sale date.

In other instances, the representation that the application would be evaluated if
the missing documents were submitted by the due date was inaccurate because
Seterus held foreclosure sales on the properties before the due date.
Additionally, in an effort to better assist borrowers seeking loss mitigation,
Seterus sent anew Acknowledgment Notice for each document a borrower
sent in, even though these additional Acknowledgment Notices were not
required by Regulation X. These additional Acknowledgment Notices usually

provided a new due date, which resulted in some borrowers receiving multiple
30.

Acknowledgment Notices with different due dates on the same day, or in
quick succession, some of which were inaccurate.

Seterus discovered the systemic errors in the data provided by its third-party
vendor as early as the first quarter of 2014, and took steps to attempt to
remedy the problems, but many of those attempts were either ineffective or
compounded the problem. For example, in January 2015, Seterus instituted
manual reviews in an attempt to correct the errors in its Acknowledgment
Notices but continued to rely on incorrect data from its third-party vendor to
populate its systems and to process and track the applications. Asa result,
Seterus continued to send out Acknowledgment Notices with defects, albeit at
a significantly lower defect rate.

Further, in 2014, when Seterus first realized that some consumers had
received inaccurate Acknowledgment Notices, Seterus issued âcorrectionâ
Acknowledgment Notices. Because Seterus continued to rely on the
inaccurate datafrom its vendor to generatethem, some âcorrectionâ
Acknowledgment Notices contained the same errors as the original inaccurate
Acknowledgment Notices.

On September 4, 2014, Seterus andthe New Hampshire Banking Department
entered into a settlement related to Seterusâs inaccurate Acknowledgment

Notices.

On March 20, 2015, Seterus reported these issues to the Bureau.

Seterus continued to send out inaccurate Acknowledgment Notices containing
certain defects through April 2018, though the types and frequency of defects
declined over time.

Seterus took stepsto mitigate the harm caused by its inaccurate
Acknowledgment Notices by offering streamlined loan modifications, which
are modification offers made without requiring the borrower to submit any
hardship or income documentation, and waiving or foregoing foreclosure
deficiency judgments for certain borrowers who receiveda Defective
Acknowledgment Notice.

Seterusâs use of inaccurate data from its vendor, failureto provide accurate or
complete information about what documents Seterus had received from
consumers and what documents consumers still needed to submit to complete
their loss mitigation applications, failure to provide due dates, and provision
of incorrect or unreasonable due dates, delayed or deprived some borrowers of
a reasonable opportunity to get their loss mitigation applications completed
and evaluated, and resulted in some borrowers suffering improper foreclosure
activity because they were either delayed in obtaining or unable to obtain a

foreclosure hold.

Seterus Failed to Evaluate Borrowers Who Submitted Complete
Loss Mitigation Applications for all Loss Mitigation Options Available
to the Borrower.

 

Seterusâs Loss Mitigation department was divided into two separate divisions
â Retention and Liquidation.

Seterusâs loss mitigation policies did not allow for a borrower to be reviewed
simultaneously for both retention and liquidation options.

Borrowers who failed to indicate a preference for either retention or
liquidation, and borrowers who requested to be reviewed for both options at
the same time, were told their applications could not be reviewed until they
made their intention clear about whether or not they wanted to retain the
property.

If a borrower submitted a loss mitigation application that did not indicate a
preference for either retention or liquidation, Seterus considered the document
incomplete andthe borrower was required to resubmit the application with
only one of the two review types selected.

Borrowers who indicated a preference for retention were not reviewed for
liquidation options unless they were denied a retention option and then
subsequently requested a liquidation review, usually by submitting anew
application form requesting consideration for liquidation options. If

documents in their initial retention application had expired by thetime the
42.

46.

2020-BCFP-0024 Document1 Filed 12/18/2020 Page 20 of 45

borrower was denied a retention option, the borrower may have had to submit
updated supporting documentation in addition to new documents that Seterus
required only when evaluating a borrowerâs eligibility for a liquidation option.
Borrowers who indicated a preference for a liquidation option were not
reviewed for retention options unless they submitted a new loss mitigation
application requesting areview for retention options.

Seterus further divided its review of liquidation options between short sales
and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, and did not permit borrowers to be reviewed
simultaneously for both options.

Seterus Did Not Treat Liquidation Applications as âFacially Complete.â

Seterus did not treat loss mitigation applications seeking a liquidation option
as âfacially completeâ even when those applications met the requirements of a
âfacially completeâ application under Regulation X.
Seterusâs Violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act,
12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 and 5536(a)(1)(B)
The CFPA prohibits covered persons from engaging âin any unfair, deceptive,

or abusive act or practice.â 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

Unfair Acts and Practices

substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable and ifthe substantial injury

is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.
12 U.S.C. Â§5531(c).

As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterusâs use of inaccurate data
from its third-party vendor and inaccurate com puter coding delayed or
deprived borrowers ofa reasonable opportunity to get their loss mitigation
applications completed and evaluated.

These acts or practices caused or were likely to cause substantial injury to
borrowers in the form of additional interest, late fees, and negative credit
reporting; failure to qualify for loss mitigation; and delayed protection from
prohibited foreclosure activities or an inability to obtain such protection at all.
These injuries were not reasonably avoidable by borrowers as borrowers could
not modify their loans without the assistance of Seterus.

These injuries were not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to
consumers or competition. Neither borrowers nor competition realized a
benefit from Seterusâs use of inaccurate data and coding to process, review,
track, and communicate information regarding loss mitigation applications.
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus engaged in unfair acts and practices

in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c)(1), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Acts and Practices

 

An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material representation or
omission that misleads, or is likely to mislead, a consumer acting reasonably
under the circumstances.

As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent numerous
Acknowledgment Notices during the Relevant Period that misrepresented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that: certain loss mitigation
documents had been received; certain loss mitigation documents had not been
received; the borrowerâs loss mitigation application was âcompleteâ or
âfacially completeâ; that the due date for documents that had not been
received was the date set forth in the Acknowledgment Notice, and/orthe
borrowerâs application would be reviewed and evaluated for loss mitigation if
the borrower submitted the missing documents by the due date set forth in the
Acknowledgment Notice. It was reasonable for borrowers to believe that the
information they received from their mortgage servicer regarding the status of
their loss mitigation application, the documents they needed to submit, and
due dates for those documents, was accurate.

Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus engaged in deceptive acts and

practices in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Seterusâs Violations of Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41
Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(2)

Regulation X requires a servicer to send a(b)(2) Notice within five days of
receipt ofa loss mitigation application, which informs the borrower: (1) that
the servicer has received the application; (2) that the servicer has determined
that the application is either complete or incomplete; and (3) if the application
is incomplete, what additional documents and information the borrower must
submit to make the application complete and a reasonable date by which they
should be submitted. 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), 1024.41(b)(2) (ii).
As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent numerous purported
(b)(2) Notices that failed to accurately or completely state the additional
documents and information the borrower needed to submit to make their loss
mitigation application complete.
As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent numerous purported
(b)(2) Notices that failed to provide a due date, and when due dates were
provided, those due dates were often inaccurate or unreasonable.
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§

Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(1)

 

Regulation X requires servicers to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining
documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application. 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(1).

As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent Acknowledgment
Notices that failed to identify or incorrectly or incompletely identified the
documents and information Seterus required from the borrower to complete
their loss mitigation applications.

By sending Acknowledgment Notices that failed to accurately and completely
describe the information required to complete borrower applications, Seterus
did not exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information
necessary to complete the application.

Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(1).

Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)()

 

Regulation X requires a servicer to âevaluate the borrower for all loss
mitigation options availableto the borrowerâ within 30 days, ifthe servicer
receives a âcompleteâ loss mitigation application more than 37 days before a
foreclosure sale. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1).

As described in paragraphs 37 through 43, Seterus bifurcated its loss

mitigation review and would not review borrowers for both retention and
65.

2020-BCFP-0024 Document1 Filed 12/18/2020 Page 25 of 45

liquidation options at the same time, nor would Seterus review borrowers
seeking liquidation for all available liquidation options.
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated Â§ 12 C.F.R.
1024.41(c)(1)(i).

Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(2)(v)
Regulation X provides that loss mitigation applications shall be considered
âfacially completeâ (1) when a borrower submits all the missing documents
and information as stated in the (b)(2) Notice, or (2) when no additional
documents or information are requested in the (b)(2) Notice. 12 C.F.R. Â§
1024.41(c)(2)(iv).
As described in paragraph 44, Seterus did not treat liquidation applications as
facially complete even when those applications were facially complete as
defined by 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(2)(iv).
By failing to treat borrowersâ liquidation applications as facially complete,
Seterus deprived those borrowers of the protections and rights specified in 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(d), (e), (f)(2), (g), & (h).
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated 12 C.F.R.

Seterusâs Violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A)

70. The CFPA provides that it is unlawful for any covered person âto offer or
provide to a consumer any financial product or service not in conformity with
Federal consumer financial law, or otherwise commit any act or omission in
violation of a Federal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

71. Theterm âFederal consumer financial lawâ includes any rule prescribed by
the Bureau under an enumerated consumer law. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(14).
Regulation X is âFederal consumer financial lawâ because it is arule
prescribed by the Bureau under RESPA, which is an âenumerated consumer
law.â 12U.S.C. Â§5481(12)(M).

72. Thus, Seterusâs violations of Regulation X described in paragraphs 13 through
44 during the Relevant Period also constitute violations of the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Mortgage Servicer for Illegal
Practices that Impeded Borrowersâ Attempts to Avoid Foreclosure

DEC 18, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Seterus, Inc. (Seterus) and Kyanite Services, Inc. (Kyanite), as Seterusâs
successor in interest, based on the Bureauâs finding that Seterus violated the Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) and Regulation X. The Bureau found that Seterusâs
actions resulted in delaying or depriving some borrowers of a reasonable opportunity to
get their loss mitigation applications completed and evaluated and in some borrowers
failing to timely receive protections against prohibited foreclosure activities to which they
were legally entitled.

The consent order addresses widespread failures in Seterusâs handling and processing of
struggling homeownersâ applications for loss mitigation options, which are alternatives to
foreclosure made available through their servicer. The consent order requires Kyanite, as
Seterusâs successor in interest, to pay consumer redress and a civil money penalty. The
consent order requires Kyanite to pay $4,932,525 in total redress to approximately 11,866
of the consumers to whom Seterus sent a defective acknowledgment notice. The consent
order also imposes a $500,000 civil money penalty and includes injunctive relief that would
apply in the event Kyanite engages in mortgage servicing.

As a mortgage servicer, Seterus was responsible for collecting borrower applications for
these programs, communicating with borrowers regarding their applications, determining
eligibility, and implementing loss mitigation programs for qualified borrowers. At its height,
Seterus, a former mortgage servicer based in North Carolina, serviced approximately
500,000 residential mortgage loans. Seterus is no longer operating. On Feb. 28, 2019, after
the relevant period covered by the Bureauâs investigation, Seterus was sold and its entire
mortgage servicing portfolio was transferred to Nationstar Mortgage LLC, doing business as
Mr. Cooper.

The Bureau found that Seterus, which used automated processes for handling loss
mitigation applications, committed unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by
systematically failing to accurately review, process, track, and communicate to borrowers
information regarding their applications. The Bureau found that Seterus also engaged in
deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by sending numerous borrowers
acknowledgment notices regarding their applications that misrepresented the status of
borrower documents and provided inaccurate due dates for submission of borrower
documents.

The Bureau found that Seterus violated Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act, by sending numerous acknowledgment notices that failed to
state the additional documents and information borrowers needed to submit to complete
their loss mitigation applications or failed to provide a reasonable due date for submission
of borrower documents. The Bureau also found that Seterus violated Regulation X by not
exercising reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to
complete borrowersâ loss mitigation applications and by failing to properly evaluate
borrowers who submitted complete loss mitigation applications for all loss mitigation
options available to the borrower. The Bureau further found that Seterus failed to treat
certain applications as âfacially completeâ when required under Regulation X. These
violations also constitute violations of the CFPA.

Seterus sent out thousands of defective acknowledgment notices between 2014 and 2018.
As a result of Seterusâs violations, some borrowers were delayed or deprived of a
reasonable opportunity to get their loss mitigation applications completed and evaluated,
and were delayed in receiving or deprived of the protections against prohibited foreclosure
activities to which they were entitled under Regulation X. Some borrowers suffered
improper foreclosure activity as a result. Borrowers also incurred injuries such as negative
credit reporting, additional late fees, and additional interest as a result of defective
acknowledgment notices that delayed or impaired their ability to obtain the benefits of a
loss mitigation option.

Respondents have a distribution network with over 200,000 send-and-
receive locations, offices in 18 countries, and operations in all 50 of the
United States.

Respondents describe themselves as âa leading remittance provider in the
[U.S.] to Mexico Corridorâ and focus on immigrant communities in the
United States.

Respondentsâ remittance transfers involve transmitting funds and constitute
payment services. These services are offered to consumers primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes. The services are therefore
âconsumer financial product[s] or service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5481(6), (15)(A)(iv), (15)(A)(vii).

Respondents are also remittance-transfer providers under EFT A and
Regulation E because they provide remittance transfers for consumers in the
normal course of their businesses. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(g)(3); 12 C.F.R. Â§
1005.30(f).

In 2010, EFT A was amended by adding Â§ 919 to create a comprehensive
system of consumer protections for remittance transfers sent by U.S.
consumers to individuals and businesses in foreign countries. Section 919
includes a number of requirements related to remittance transfers, including

that:

e remittance-transfer providers must disclose the exchange rate, the
amount to be received, and other information both before and at
the time the consumer pays for the transfer, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-

I(a)(1) & (2);

e consumers have certain rights regarding cancellation and refunds,
15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d);

e remittance-transfer providers must investigate disputes and remedy
errors regarding remittances, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d); and

e remittance-transfer providers are liable for certain acts of their
agents, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16300-1(f).

The Bureau issued rules to implement these requirements, which became
effective on October 28, 2013. These rules are known as the Remittance
Rule.

Respondents provide remittance transfers to consumers using their retail
branches and a network of agents across the United States, including
convenience stores, supermarkets, and other retail establishments where they
have installed a dedicated computer or a telephone that can be used to send
remittance transfers using Respondentsâ services.

As of October 28, 2013, the effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondents have been subject to the requirements of EFT A and the
Remittance Rule.

Respondents were aware of the Remittance Rule and made operational
changes after the Rule became effective but did not fully comply with some

of the disclosure and error-resolution requirements.

From 2013 until at least 2019, Respondents engaged in the acts and practices
in providing remittance transfers as described below.

Respondents violated Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (c)(2) (ii) (B)
by failing to notify some consumers of the remedies available for

correcting errors and providing those consumers with the appropriate remedy.

17.

18.

19.

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance-transfer
providers to investigate promptly a notice of error received from a sender
and to determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving
notice. Section 1005.33(c)(1) further requires remittance-transfer providers
to âreport the results to the sender, including notice of any remedies
available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred,
within three business days after completing its investigation.â

Among other things, it is generally an error if a remittance-transfer provider
fails to make funds available to a designated recipient by the date of
availability stated in the receipt or combined disclosure that the provider
provides to a sender under Â§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).

Section 1005.33(c)(2)(11)(B) of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance-
transfer provider to refund fees imposed on a remittance transfer to a sender
following an assertion of an error when the provider commits an error under
Â§ 1005.33(a)(1 )(iv) by failing to make funds available to the designated

recipient by the date of availability in the receipt or combined disclosure.

When Respondents committed errors under Â§ 1005.33(a)(1 \1v), they
refunded fees only to senders who, as a remedy, requested that Respondents
cancel the transaction. Respondents did not refund fees to senders who, as a
remedy, requested that Respondents resend the transaction.

Between 2015 and 2019, for senders who requested that Respondents resend
the remittance transfer as a remedy, Respondents did not adequately notify
those consumers of the available remedies or refund fees imposed on the
remittance transfer in a total of more than 9,280 instances and resulting in a
total cost to consumers of approximately $99,944.95.

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (c)(2)(11)(B).

Respondents violated Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (d)(1)
by failing to properly report the results of error investigations

and failing to notify consumers of their rights after error investigations.

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance-transfer
providers to investigate promptly a notice of error from a sender and to
determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving notice.
Section 1005.33(c)(1) further requires remittance-transfer providers to
âreport the results to the sender, including notice of any remedies available
for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred, within

three business days after completing its investigation.â

Section 1005.33(d)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance-transfer
provider to follow certain procedures if it determines that no error occurred
or if a different error occurred than the error identified in the senderâs notice
of error. Specifically, this section requires the remittance-transfer provider to
give the sender a written explanation of the providerâs findings regarding the
notice of error and to note the senderâs right to request the documents on
which the remittance-transfer provider relied in making its determination.
From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least 2019, it was
Respondentsâ practice to inform consumers about complaint-investigation
results only by telephone, even if Respondents found no error or a different
error from the one alleged.

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (d)(1).

Respondents violated Â§ 1005. 33(g)(1) by failing to develop
and maintain written policies and procedures designed to ensure

compliance with certain error-resolution requirements of the Remittance Rule.

27.

28.

Section 1005.33(g)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance-transfer
providers to develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are
designed to ensure compliance with the Ruleâs error-resolution
requirements.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule to at least 2019,

Respondents had no written policies and procedures on the

appropriate remedies for correcting âerrors.â Respondents did not

fully comply with the Ruleâs procedures for resolving errors.

From December 2017 to at least September 2018, Respondentsâ written
policies and procedures inaccurately stated that investigation results could be
reported either orally or in writing to a consumer even in cases where the
Remittance Rule requires the provider to explain its findings in writing.
During this period, Respondents followed their written policies and
procedures, rather than the Remittance Ruleâs requirements, and so did not
provide investigation results in writing where the Rule requires written
notice.

From September 2014 to November 2017, Respondents described âerrorsâ
too narrowly in their written policies and procedures, making it likely that
following such policies and procedures would result in undercompliance
with the Rule.

Thus, between the effective date of the Remittance Rule and 2019,
Respondentsâ policies and procedures were not adequately designed to
ensure compliance with Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1), (c)(2), or (d)(1).

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(g)(1).

Sigue Corp. violated Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1) (i)-(iii), (v)-(vii), and (b)(2) (i)

by failing to identify the amounts, fees, and taxes associated with certain

transfers as required by the Remittance Rule.

Section 1005.31 of the Remittance Rule generally requires remittance-
transfer providers to give consumers certain disclosures. If providers choose
to provide those disclosures through prepayment disclosures and receipts, as
Respondents have since the Ruleâs effective date, Â§ 1005.31(b) governs the
content of those prepayment disclosures and receipts.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1)() and (b)(2)(1) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated
recipient, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using
the term âtransfer amountâ ora substantially similar term.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1 (i) and (b)(2)(4) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose any fees imposed and any taxes collected on the
remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance
transfer is funded, using the terms âtransfer feesâ for fees and âtransfer
taxesâ for taxes, or substantially similar terms.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1)(il) and (b)(2)(1) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose the total amount of the transaction, in the currency in
which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term âtotalâ ora

recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the
designated recipient, but only if certain covered third-party fees are imposed,
using the term âtransfer amountâ or a substantially similar term.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1 (vi) and (b)(2)(4) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose any covered third-party fees, in the currency in which
the funds will be received by the designated recipient, using the term âother

âtotal to recipientâ or a substantially similar term.

Between 2013 and 2019, some of Sigue Corp.âs prepayment disclosures and
receipts did not specify the currency of the various amounts, fees, and taxes
in amanner required by the Remittance Rule.

Sigue Corp. therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1)(@)-(i), (v)-(vii),

Between 2013 and at least 2019, Sigue Corp. issued prepayment disclosures
and receipts that used the Spanish phrase âcantidad netaâ and the English
translation ânet before exchangeâ to indicate the amount to be transferred to
the designated recipient. The English phrase ânet before exchangeâ is not
substantially similar to âtransfer amount.â

Sigue Corp. and GroupEx violated Â§ 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) by issuing

From at least 2018 to 2019, some Sigue Corp. receipts contained inaccurate

In at least 2019, some GroupEx receipts contained inaccurate information
about the state-licensing or -chartering agencies for Georgia, Maryland,

Sigue Corp. and GroupEx therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(b)(2)(vi).

Respondents violated Â§ 1005.31(c)(1) by issuing prepayment disclosures
that did not comply with the Remittance Ruleâs grouping requirement.

From the Ruleâs effective date through at least 2019, some of Respondentsâ

with âtransfer amount,â âtransfer fees,â âtransfer taxes,â and âtotal.â

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(c)(1).

Sigue Corp. violated Â§Â§ 1005. 31(b)(1) (viii) and (b)(2) i)
by including a statement on certain prepayment disclosures and

receipts that non-covered, third-party fees may apply to a remittance transfer.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1 (vim) and (b)(2)(4) of the Remittance Rule require a
remittance-transfer provider to disclose to a sender, as applicable, a
statement indicating that non-covered, third-party fees or taxes collected on
the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the
remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than
the amount disclosed pursuant to Â§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vu). A provider may
include this disclosure only if such fees or taxes do or may apply to the
transfer.

From the Ruleâs effective date through at least 2019, some of Sigue Corp.âs
prepayment disclosures and receipts stated that a designated ârecipient may

Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondents must, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the
Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury.

Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty and

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Remittance Transfer Providers
for Remittance Transfer Rule Violations

AUG 31, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) entered
into settlements with Trans-Fast Remittance LLC and Sigue Corporation and its subsidiaries,
SGS Corporation and GroupEx Corporation. Trans-Fast, which until recently was a
remittance transfer provider, is based in New York, New York and licensed in over 30 states.
Sigue and its subsidiaries, which are all headquartered in Sylmar, California, provide
consumers with international money-transfer services, including remittance-transfer
services. The Bureau found that Trans-Fast and Sigue and its subsidiaries violated the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and the Remittance Transfer Rule, which implements
EFTA. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act
of 2010's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. The consent orders require
the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose requirements to prevent future
violations. Sigue and its subsidiaries must also pay consumer redress. These actions reflect a
sweep of enforcement actions to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.

The Bureauâs investigation of Trans-Fast found that it violated EFTA and the Remittance
Transfer Rule by failing to adhere to error resolution requirements and properly respond to
cancellation requests, failing to provide refunds the Remittance Transfer Rule requires,
failing to maintain required policies and procedures, and failing to provide required
disclosures. Since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, Trans-Fast
provided about 40 million disclosures to consumers that violated the Remittance Transfer
Rule. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast engaged in deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA by making misleading statements in advertisements regarding the
speed of its remittance transfers and making misleading statements in disclosures
purporting to limit consumersâ error resolution rights.

The Bureauâs investigation of Sigue and its subsidiaries found that between 2013 and 2019,
they violated EFTA and the Remittance Transfer Rule. Specifically, the Bureau found that
Sigue and its subsidiaries failed to refund transaction fees when they did not make funds
available by the disclosed date of availability, and they failed to inform consumers of the
remedies available for remittance errors. When Sigue and its subsidiaries investigated
remittance errors, they failed to report to consumers in writing the results of their
investigations into transaction errors or consumersâ rights as required by the Rule. Sigue
and its subsidiaries also failed to develop and maintain adequate written policies and
procedures designed to ensure compliance with certain Remittance Transfer Rule error-
resolution requirements and failed to comply with several Remittance Transfer Rule
disclosure requirements.

The consent order against Trans-Fast requires it to pay a $1.6 million civil money penalty. If
Trans-Fast resumes offering remittance transfers, the consent order requires it to adopt a
compliance plan to ensure that its remittance transfer acts and practices comply with all
applicable Federal consumer financial laws and the consent order.

The consent order against Sigue and its subsidiaries requires them to pay about $100,000
in consumer redress and a $300,000 civil money penalty. They must also implement and
maintain written policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the
Remittance Transfer Rule and maintain a compliance-management system that is designed
to ensure that their operations comply with the Remittance Transfer Rule, including
conducting training and oversight of all agents, employees, and service providers, and not
violating the Remittance Transfer Rule in the future.

In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

SMART Payment Plan, LLC

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
acts and practices of SMART Payment Plan, LLC (Respondent, as defined below)
regarding its marketing for a Payment Accelerator Program (the SMART Plan) and
has identified the following violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, Â§

103 1(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B); 12 U.S.C. 88 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B):

1. Respondent falsely claimed in its individualized benefits disclosures that the
SMART Plan would cause consumers to save money on their auto loans. By
failing to disclose that its fees would ordinarily exceed the interest savings,
Respondent created the misleading impression that consumers would save money
using its product. Instead, most of Respondentâs consumers lost money by paying

more in fees to participate than the SMART Plan delivered in interest savings.
2. Under Sections 1053 and 1055 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of

2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order

(Consent Order).

consented to the issuance of this Consent Order by the Bureau under sections 1053
and 1055 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563 and 5565, without admitting or denying

IV
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
6. Respondent is a limited liability company organized in Texas with its
principal place of business in Austin, Texas. At all times material to this complaint,
Respondent has collected and transmitted consumer funds from consumers to their
lenders or servicers, activity that constitutes a consumer financial product or
service covered by the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (15)(A)(v). Respondent is
both a âcovered personâ and âservice providerâ as those terms are defined by 12
U.S.C. 8Â§ 5481(6) and (26).
7. Respondent offers a single consumer financial product or service, the

SMART Plan.
8. Respondent markets the SMART Plan as a program that purports to allow
consumers to pay off loans faster and more cheaply by making automatic partial
payments that match their paydays with bi-weekly payments instead of monthly
payments.

9. Because there are 52 weeks in a year, consumers enrolled in the bi-weekly
program make 26 half payments to SMART each year, resulting in the equivalent
of making 13 monthly payments or one full extra payment to Respondent each
year.

10. Respondent holds the consumersâ extra payments and uses the first extra
payment or payments to pay itself all or part of a membership fee.

11. During the Relevant Period that fee was $399.

12. Additionally, during the Relevant Period, Respondent charged consumers a
$1.95 per bi-weekly debit fee.

13. Respondent markets the SMART Plan to consumers almost exclusively

through automobile dealers.

14. During the Relevant Period, Respondent enrolled over 180,000 consumers
into the SMART Plan. Tens of thousands of these consumers paid the full

enrollment fee on an interest-bearing loan.
Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Misrepresentations Regarding
the SMART Planâs Benefits

15. During the Relevant Period, Respondent provided car dealerships with
integrated software that was used to enroll consumers in the SMART Plan.

16. The software generates customized disclosure forms called the âBenefits
Summary.â

17. During the Relevant Period, for the purpose of inducing consumers to enroll
in the SMART Plan, Respondent stated in each consumerâs Benefits Summary a
specific amount of interest savings the consumer would purportedly achieve by
enrolling in the SMART Plan.

18. Respondent failed to disclose that the fees to achieve this purported savings
would ordinarily exceed the interest savings, resulting in most consumers losing
money by enrolling in the SMART Plan.

19. In other Benefits Summaries, Respondent represented to consumers that they
would receive specific dollar savings amounts that it called the âAccelerated
Payment Advantage,â which refers to the reduced loan balance at a particular time
in the loan schedule.

20. But Respondent failed to disclose to consumers that they would actually
have to pay more than the Accelerated Payment Advantage amount to achieve this

reduction in balance.
21. During the Relevant Period, none of Respondentâs disclosures informed
consumers of the total cost or net cost of the SMART Plan even though the same
software that calculated its other representations was capable of calculating
individual consumersâ costs.

22. Respondent marketed the SMART Plan as a financial benefit to consumers,
however, Respondent was aware that during the Relevant Period the vast majority
of its consumers ended up paying more in total on their loans by enrolling in the
SMART Plan.

23. Additionally, most of Respondentâs consumers dropped out of the SMART
Plan before the end of their loan term, resulting in them not receiving even the
misleading benefit amounts promised by Respondent.

24. Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or abusiveâ
acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

25. Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraphs 15â22 constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the

CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a civil money

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with SMART Payment Plan, LLC for
Deceptive Sales Practices

NOV 02, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against SMART Payment Plan, LLC (SMART), finding that the companyâs
disclosures of its loan payment program contained misleading statements in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010's prohibition against deceptive acts or practices.
SMART is a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Austin, Texas.
SMART operates a loan payment program for auto loans called the SMART Plan that
deducts payments from consumersâ bank accounts every two weeks and then forwards
these payments every month to the consumersâ lenders. The consent order imposes a
judgment against SMART requiring it to pay $7,500,000 in consumer redress and
requirements to prevent future violations.

SMART provided consumers individualized âbenefits summariesâ that purported to state a
specific amount of interest savings or other money savings consumers would get by
enrolling in the SMART Plan, but SMARTâs fees would ordinarily exceed the savings.
SMART's disclosures thus created the misleading impression that consumers would save
money using its product.

The ordered redress amount is suspended upon SMARTâs payment of $1,500,000 by
December 31, 2020 and a $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau. The suspension of the full
payment for redress, as well as the $1 civil penalty, is based on SMARTâs demonstrated
inability to pay more based on sworn financial statements. Harmed consumers may be
eligible for additional relief from the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund. The consent order
prohibits SMART from making any misrepresentations about its payment programs. It also
requires SMART to account for the total costs for its payment programs, as well as the net
savings or costs after deducting any fees, whenever SMART makes claims about savings or
financial benefits.

In the Matter of:

CONSENT ORDER

Sovereign Lending Group, Inc.

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
direct-mail mortgage advertising activities of Sovereign Lending Group, Inc.
(Sovereign or Respondent, as defined below) and identified violations of Â§ 1026.24
of Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24, the implementing regulation of the Truth in
Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. Â§$Â§ 1601â1667f; Â§ 1014.3 of the Mortgage Acts
and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule or Regulation N), 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.3; and Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536. Under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12

U.S.C. 88 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order.
Overview
Sovereign is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides
mortgages guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA). Occasionally, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in
other situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to
provide loans.
Sovereign advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
Sovereign has sent consumers hundreds of thousands of advertisements that
violate federal law because of misleading and deceptive statements and
inadequate disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop Sovereign from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

Sovereign offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by
the VA.

Sovereignâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since January 2016, Sovereign has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in about 44 states and the District of Columbia.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of
Sovereignâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through Sovereign.
False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Sovereign was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,

as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Sovereignâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and payment amount.
By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Sovereign represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms.

In fact, Sovereign did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Sovereign misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, Sovereign was not actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to 87,000 consumers in
September 2018 advertised a variable-rate mortgage with a fixed interest
rate of 2.75% for the first five years and an APR of 3.5%.

In fact, the advertised APR was not correct because it did not take into

account the fully indexed rate, required discount points, or origination fees.
30.

33.

34.

35.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account the fully indexed rate, required discount points, and
origination, underwriting, and funding fees, exceeded 3.75%.

Accordingly, Sovereign misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements misrepresented the payment
amount applicable to the advertised mortgage and the existence, nature, or
amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection with the
mortgage.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to 87,000 consumers in
September 2018 stated in a box near the top, âTake $27,909 CASH-OUT
FOR ONLY $113.94 PER MONTH!â (upper case in original).

In reality, obtaining any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home
equity would be possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and
refinanced the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out
refinance mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than
$113.94.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements misleadingly advertised

variable-rate loans as âfixedâ rate loans.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 19,600 consumers in
February 2019 used the phrase âNew FIXED Rateâ (upper case in original)
next to the advertised interest rate on the front, but in fine print on the back,
stated that the advertised loan was, in fact, a variable-rate mortgage.

In these advertisements, the phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-
Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not appear before the first use of the word
âfixed,â nor was the phrase at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisements.

In these advertisements, the word âfixedâ was not accompanied by an
equally prominent and closely proximate statement of the period for which
the rate or payment would be fixed, and of the fact that the rate may vary or
the payment may increase after that period.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27-38
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About the Consumerâs Ability or

Likelihood to Obtain the Advertised Credit Term

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements falsely represented that
consumers were prequalified for, or had a high likelihood of obtaining, the
advertised loan.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 25,500 consumers in
October 2018 stated: âAs a VA loan holder, youâre prequalified to upgrade
your home loan and pay off your mortgage sooner by refinancing with
Sovereign ....â These advertisements also stated: âPRESCREEN & OPT-
OUT NOTICE: This âprescreenedâ offer of credit is based on information in
your credit report indicating that you meet certain criteriaâ (emphasis in
original).

In fact, consumers who received these advertisements had not been selected
or screened based on credit scores or other prescreened credit data.

In another example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 4,300
consumers in October 2018 stated near the top of the front page âLow FICO
Score OK,â among or in close proximity to other specific credit terms of the
advertised loan, such as the APR, interest rate, and payment amount.

But in fine print on the back, these advertisements stated: âOffer rate...

assumes ... all borrowers having a credit score of at least 740.â The

statement âLow FICO Score OKâ was false and did not apply to the loans
offered in these advertisements.

Sovereign targeted these advertisements to consumers with FICO scores in
the range of 560-750. Thus, most consumers who received these
advertisements likely did not have a credit score of at least 740 and therefore
would not have been candidates for the advertised loan.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 41-46
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About
an Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly
or by implication, that Sovereign was affiliated with the government.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 87,000 consumers in
September 2018 contained these phrases or terms: âEligibility Notice;â
âReference #: V146310333â; and â[a]s a VA loan holder, the Department of
Veteran Affairs allows you to combine... .â These advertisements were
published on light green paper that is similar to the light green paper that the

VA has used for Certificates of Eligibility, and the VA Certificates of

Eligibility contain a certificate âReference Numberâ that generally has eight

In another example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 236,900
consumers in February 2019 stated âEligibility Status: Pending
Authorization;â âMortgage Payment Reduction Notification;â âReduction
Notice;â âReference # V107652374;â and â[als a VA loan holder, the
Department of Veteran Affairs allows you to combine... .â These
advertisements included the year â2019â printed in block numbers in the top
right corner, with the â20â in white and the â19â in black, a distinctive
format used by the IRS. These advertisements also set forth information in
boxes similar to an IRS Form W-4.

Those representations were false because Sovereign was not affiliated with
the government.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 49-52
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False Representations About Late Payments,
Rate Adjustments, and Payment Increases

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements contained false statements
that the consumer was late on her loan payments and that there were
unauthorized rate adjustments or unnecessary payment increases on her loan.
Specifically, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 236,900 consumers in
February 2019 stated in a banner across the center: âNOTICE REGARDING
LATE PAYMENT, UNAUTHORIZED INTEREST RATE
ADJUSTMENTS OR UNNECESSARY PAYMENT INCREASES YOUR
IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION IS REQUESTEDâ (upper case in
original).

These representations were false. The advertisements were not notices
regarding late payments, unauthorized interest rate adjustments, or
unnecessary payment increases.

The advertisements were likely to lead consumers into believing that they
needed to read the advertisement because the consumer was purportedly late
with mortgage payments or because her current lender had purportedly
wrongly charged additional sums through improper interest rate or payment
increases. The advertisements were also likely to lead consumers into

believing that refinancing with Sovereign would avoid or prevent the

purported late payment, rate adjustments, or payment increases on the
consumerâs existing loan, or associated negative impacts.

The advertisements purported to convey important information about the
consumerâs existing loan in a manner that would induce the consumer to
read the advertisement, and that would frighten or pressure the consumer
into potentially obtaining a new loan from Sovereign.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 55-59
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions regarding a product or service.

Inadequate Disclosures

Most of Sovereignâs mortgage advertisements stated a number of payments,
payment amount, or simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of
Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d), and (f), the use of these terms
triggers specific disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did
not include the other disclosures that are required, or did not include them in
the manner required.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements stated the number of

payments or the amount of a payment, but failed to state the terms of
64.

repayment reflecting the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 19,600 consumers in
February 2019 stated that the advertised loan would require a total of 360
payments and a fixed monthly payment of $923 that would apply to the first
five years.

Although these advertisements stated the number of payments and the
payment amount for the fixed-rate period of the loan, they failed to state the
amount of each payment and the number and period of the payments during
the variable-rate period of the loan (years 6 to 30).

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements for a loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of interest, but
failed to state the period during which each simple annual rate of interest
would apply; failed to state an accurate APR for the loan because the stated
APR was not correctly calculated under the accuracy standards set forth in
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22; or failed to state these
terms clearly and conspicuously.

For example, Sovereign advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
at least 87,000 consumers in September 2018 stated on the front a simple

annual interest rate of 2.75% and an APR of 3.5% that applied to the first

five years of the advertised loan, but the advertised APR was not correct
because it did not take into account the fully indexed rate, discount points
required to obtain the advertised interest rate, and origination fees.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account the fully indexed rate, discount points required to
obtain the advertised interest rate, and origination fees, exceeded 3.75%.
The APR disclosed in the advertisements did not comply with the accuracy
standards set forth in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2).

The advertisements also did not contain an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the period during which the 2.75% interest rate
would apply. The fact that the advertised interest rate applied only to the
first five years was disclosed in fine print on the back of the advertisements.
Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply
over the term of the loan (e.g., for adjustable-rate mortgages, payments
based on the application of the sum of a reasonably current index and
margin); or failed to state the period during which each payment would
apply.

For example, Sovereign advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to

at least 87,000 consumers in September 2018 stated an estimated payment

amount that was based on an introductory, discount rate of 2.75% that
applied only to the first five years of the advertised loan. That payment was
not calculated based on the index and margin that would be used to make
subsequent payment adjustments over the remaining term of the loan, and
the advertisements failed to state any payment amount based on a reasonably
current index and margin. As of the date of the advertisements, the fully
indexed rate, based on a reasonably current index and margin, was at least
4.3%. The advertisements failed to disclose the payment amounts associated
with that rate after the first five years. Moreover, the advertisements failed
to state the period during which each payment would apply.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements used the name of the
consumerâs current lender without disclosing with equal prominence the
name of the person making the advertisement and without including a clear
and conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.
Specifically, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 87,000 consumers in
September 2018 used the name of the consumerâs current lender without

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 23-38,
numerous Sovereign advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.
Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any

balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)(i1).

Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs 63-65,
numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements set forth the period of

1026.24(d)(1)(i1) and (111), but failed to state the repayment obligations over

the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)qi1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)()

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1), ifa direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the

[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in

Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs

for which more than one simple annual interest rate would apply stated a

simple annual rate of interest but did not include one or more of the

Inadequate Disclosure of Payment Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i)

80. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(1), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be

disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;
and

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien on a
dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts

for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the
actual payment obligation will be greater.

81. Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)() because, as described in Paragraphs

amount of a payment but did not include one or more of the disclosures

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ

and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the

rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period....

83. Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 35-

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.
Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-36 and 39-40,
Sovereignâs mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by
implication, that specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or
offered by the creditor, including representations about specific APRs,

payment amounts, or the variable or fixed nature of rates or payments, when
2020-BCFP-0005 Document1 Filed 07/24/2020 Page 29 of 56

in fact those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that
Sovereign was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

102. Sovereignâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

103. Sovereignâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

104. Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Consumersâ
Ability or Likelihood to Obtain the Advertised Mortgage or Credit Term

105. In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 41-48, Sovereignâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
consumers who received the advertisements had been prequalified or
prescreened for the advertised mortgage based on information in their credit
report or that the credit terms stated in the advertisements were available to

borrowers with a âLow FICO Score.â

In fact, consumers who received these advertisements had not been selected
or screened for the advertised mortgage and were not able to obtain the
credit terms stated in the advertisements with a âLow FICO Score.â
Sovereignâs representations about prequalifying or prescreening consumers
and the availability of stated credit terms for consumers with a âLow FICO
Scoreâ were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about prequalifying or prescreening
consumers and the availability of stated credit terms for consumers with a
âLow FICO Scoreâ were material because they were likely to affect the
conduct or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
Deceptive Representations About Government Affiliation

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 49-54, Sovereignâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
Sovereign was affiliated with the government.

In fact, Sovereign was not affiliated with the government.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to

mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were material
because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers.
Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Late Payments,
Rate Adjustments, and Payment Increases

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 55-61, Sovereignâs
mortgage advertisements contained false statements that the consumer was
late on her loan payments and that there were unauthorized rate adjustments
or unnecessary payment increases on her loan.

These representations had no basis and were false for many consumers.
Sovereignâs misrepresentations about late payments, unauthorized rate
adjustments, and unnecessary payment increases were likely to mislead
consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about late payments, unauthorized rate
adjustments, and unnecessary payment increases were likely to influence the
conduct or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of

Under the CFPA, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules
thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1 (A), 5481(14).
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.
Sovereignâs violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in

If Respondent screens or selects consumers to receive any direct-mail
mortgage advertisements based on consumersâ credit scores or credit
tiers, those advertisements may only contain specific credit terms that
are available to consumers with a credit score equal to or less than the
credit score or credit tier of the recipient consumers.

In any direct-mail mortgage advertisement, if the advertisement states
an interest rate or APR that is available only to consumers whose
credit scores are above a threshold number, that fact (including the
applicable credit score threshold) must be disclosed Clearly and
Prominently on the same side of the advertisement as the advertised

interest rate or APR.

1.

2.

The amount or percentage of the downpayment;

The term of the loan in either months, years, or number of
monthly payments;

The amount of each payment that will apply over the term of
the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be
disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;
The period during which each payment will apply;

The fact that the payments do not include amounts for taxes and
insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation will be greater;

The loan amount upon which the disclosures are based; and
The âannual percentage rate,â using that term, and, if the rate

may be increased after consummation, that fact.
2020-BCFP-0005 Document1 Filed 07/24/2020 Page 38 of 56

In any direct-mail advertisement for an adjustable rate mortgage,

Respondent must:

1. State, Clearly and Prominently, that the product is an
âadjustable rate mortgage,â using those words. The
advertisement may not use the term âhybridâ before the first use
of the phrase âadjustable rate mortgageâ;

2. For each simple annual rate of interest disclosed that is based
on an index and margin, base the rate on an index value in
effect on the date of the advertisement or within 60 days prior,
and disclose the index and margin; and

3. State that more information about adjustable rate mortgages is

available at https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201401_cfpb_

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to
payment made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil
money penalty paid under this Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the

civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the

Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.
Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be

returned to Respondent.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Mortgage Companies to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

JUL 24, 2020

Washington, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued
consent orders against Sovereign Lending Group, Inc. (Sovereign) and Prime Choice
Funding, Inc. (Prime Choice). Sovereign is a California corporation that is licensed as a
mortgage broker or lender in about 44 states and the District of Columbia. Prime Choice is
a California corporation that is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 35 states
and the District of Columbia. Both companies offer and provide mortgage loans
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Their principal means
of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to
United States military servicemembers and veterans. The Bureau found that the companies
mailed consumers advertisements for VA-guaranteed mortgages that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or lacked required disclosures, in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and
practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices - Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z.
The consent orders require the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose
requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs actions stem from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple mortgage
companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages. The Bureau
commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful advertising in
the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising provides
consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and terms
available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This ongoing
sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure
the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Sovereign and Prime disseminated advertisements that contained
false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures.
For example, Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements misrepresented the credit terms
of the advertised mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually
prepared to offer to the consumer. Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements
misleadingly described an advertised introductory interest rate as a âfixedâ rate, when in fact
the rate was adjustable and could increase over time. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also created the false impression that they were affiliated with the
government by using words, phrases, images, or designs that are associated with the VA or
the Internal Revenue Service.

The Bureau also found that both Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements used the
name of the consumer's lender in a misleading way by not adequately disclosing their own
names and the fact that they were not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the
consumer's current lender, as required by Regulation Z. Sovereign advertisements made
false claims about consumer's existing loans, and falsely implied that the consumer could
address these problems by obtaining a loan from Sovereign. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit terms
for the advertised mortgage, such as the consumer's repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan and the period during which certain interest rates would apply. Further,
Prime Choice advertisements created the false impression that they contained a property
assessment as well as misleading comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the
terms of the advertised product.

The consent order against Sovereign requires Sovereign to pay a civil penalty of $460,000.
The consent order against Prime Choice requires Prime Choice to pay a civil penalty of
$645,000. The consent orders also impose injunctive relief to prevent future violations,
including requiring the companies to bolster their compliance functions by designating an
advertising compliance official who must review their mortgage advertisements for
compliance with mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting
misrepresentations similar to those identified by the Bureau; and requiring the companies
to comply with certain enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent them from making
future misrepresentations.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

Respondent is a residential-mortgage servicer located in Highlands Ranch,
Colorado. As of February 29, 2020, Respondent serviced a portfolio of
mortgage loans worth about $112.69 billion.

Respondent is a âcovered personâ as defined by 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6) and a
âservicerâ as defined by 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.2(b) because, among other things,
it services loans and is responsible for servicing federally related mortgage

loans within the meaning of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.2(b).
Findings and Conclusions
as to Respondentâs Prohibited Foreclosure Actions

Regulation X generally protects a borrower who has submitted a facially
complete or complete Loss-Mitigation Application from certain foreclosure
activities from the date the borrower submits a facially complete or complete
Loss-Mitigation Application through specific end dates. For facially
complete Loss-Mitigation Applications, foreclosure protections continue
through the period in which the borrower is given a reasonable opportunity
to provide the additional information or documents necessary to complete
the Loss-Mitigation Application. For complete Loss-Mitigation
Applications, including those that are facially complete and become
complete, foreclosure protections continue until the determination of
whether an alternative to foreclosure is viable and while the parties are
working toward such an alternative, unless one of the circumstances
specified in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(Â£)(2) or (g) is met.
During this period, Regulation X prohibits a servicer from:
a. making the First Filing, if the borrower submits the complete Loss-
Mitigation Application before the servicer making the First Filing;
b. Moving for Judgment, if the borrower submits the complete Loss-
Mitigation Application after the servicer made the First Filing but

more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale; and
8.

10.

C. conducting a foreclosure sale, if the borrower submits the complete
Loss-Mitigation Application after the servicer made the First Filing
but more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale. 12 C.F.R. Â§
1024.41(f)(2), (g).

Regulation X requires these foreclosure protections to remain in place until:

a. the servicer sends an Evaluation Notice advising the borrower that he
or she is not eligible for any Loss-Mitigation Options and the appeal
period in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(h) is not applicable, the borrower has
not requested an appeal within the applicable period for requesting an
appeal, or the borrowerâs appeal has been denied;

b. the borrower rejects all Loss-Mitigation Options offered by the
servicer; or

C. the borrower fails to perform under an agreement on a Loss-
Mitigation Option. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(f)(2)(i)-(iil), (g)(1)-(3).

These protections apply to all complete Loss-Mitigation Applications,

regardless of whether the borrower indicated a preference for a Loss-

Mitigation Option that allows him or her to retain the home.

Since January 10, 2014, Respondent made First Filings, moved for

foreclosure judgment or an order of sale, and conducted foreclosure sales in
11.

12.

13.

14.

certain instances where the borrower was entitled to protection from these
actions under Regulation X. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(f)(2), (g).

Respondent therefore violated RESPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2601 et seq., and its
implementing regulation, Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(f)(2), (g), by
making First Filings, moving for foreclosure judgments or orders for sale,
and conducting foreclosure sales when the borrower was entitled to
protection from those actions. These violations are also violations of the
CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), because they reflect an act or omission
committed in violation of a Federal consumer financial law.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs
Failures to Send or Timely Send Evaluation Notices

Regulation X requires servicers, within 30 days of receiving a complete
Loss-Mitigation Application from a borrower, to evaluate the borrower for
all available loss-mitigation options and to give the borrower an Evaluation
Notice regarding those options. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1).

Since January 10, 2014, Respondent failed to send or timely send Evaluation
Notices to certain borrowers who were entitled to Evaluation Notices under
Regulation X. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)(ii).

Respondent therefore violated RESPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2601 et seq., and its

implementing regulation, Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)(qi), and
15.

2020-BCFP-0002 Document1 Filed 05/11/2020 Page 10 of 32

also the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), by committing an act or
omission in violation of a Federal consumer financial law.

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section IV of this Consent Order, and taking
into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a
civil money penalty of $250,000 to the Bureau.
Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in compliance
with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent must treat the civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order
as a penalty paid to the government for all purposes. Regardless of how the
Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order;
seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment
made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil money

penalty paid under this Consent Order.

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty, in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. Ifthe court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau and pay the
amount of the offset reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not
be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

IX.
Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. 8 1961, as

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry ofa final judgment, consent order, or settlement

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Specialized Loan Servicing,
LLC

MAY 11, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled
with Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (SLS), a mortgage-loan servicer in Colorado. As of
February 29, 2020, SLS serviced a portfolio of mortgage loans worth about $112.69 billion.
The consent order requires SLS to pay $1.275 million in monetary relief to consumers in the
form of redress and waiver of borrower deficiencies, pay a $250,000 civil money penalty,
which will be paid to the Bureau and deposited into the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund, and
implement procedures to ensure compliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act (RESPA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation X.

The Bureau's investigation found that since January 2014, SLS violated RESPA and
Regulation X by taking prohibited foreclosure actions against mortgage borrowers who
were entitled to protection from foreclosure, and by failing to send or to timely send
evaluation notices to mortgage borrowers who were entitled to them. These violations also
constitute violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. In some cases, SLSâs
violations of Regulation X short-circuited the protections against foreclosure for consumers
whose homes were ultimately foreclosed upon.

Under the settlement, SLS will pay $775,000 in restitution to affected consumers according
to a redress plan that the Bureau will approve. SLS will also pay a $250,000 civil money
penalty to the Bureau, and will waive $500,000 in borrower deficiencies. The settlement
requires SLS to implement policies and procedures that will ensure that borrowers receive
the protections from foreclosure to which they are entitled under RESPA and Regulation X,
including preventing SLS from improperly making first filings, from improperly moving for
foreclosure judgments or orders of sale, and from conducting foreclosure sales against
borrowers who have submitted timely and facially complete or complete loss-mitigation
applications. SLS must also monitor its foreclosure activity to ensure that it complies with the
policies and procedures that it must implement.

with that deposit-taking activity. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 3481(6)(A), (IS KA)GV), &
(ES )(AJGX).

Respondent is also a âfinancial institutionâ under EFTA and Regulation E
because it is a national bank holding consumer-deposit accounts. 15 U.S.C.
Â§ 1693a(9).

Respondent is also a Furnisher under FCRA and Regulation V because it
âfurnishes information relating to consumers to one or more consumer
reporting agencies for inclusion in a consumer report.â 12 C.PLR.

Â§ 1022.4 1(c).

Throughout the Relevant Period, Respondent has offered consumers three
overdratt options in connection with their consumer-checking accounts: (1) a
âstandardâ overdrali service, which covers transactions not subject to 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1005.17(b), including checks, automated clearing house (ACH),
and recurring debit-card transactions; (2) DCA, which covers Covered
Transactions: and (3) a âdecline allâ option, which opts the customer out of
overdraft services for all transaction types.

New customers may enroll in DCA when opening a consumer-checking
account online or at one of Respondentâs branches (stores). Existing
checking-account customers may enroll a new or existing checking account

in DCA at one of Respondentâs stores, online, or over the phone.

Respondent charges consumers who have enrolled in DCA a $35 overdraft
fee to pay, up to five times per day and at Respondentâs discretion, each
Covered Transaction that exceeds a consumerâs checking account available
balance (which accounts for pending debit transactions) by more than $5.
Respondent's consumer-checking accounts come with its âstandardâ
overdraft service, through which Respondent charges consumers a $35
overdraft fee to pay, at Respondentâs discretion, all other transactions (e.g.,
checks, ACH, and recurring debits) that exceed a consumerâs checking
account available balance by more than $5.

Consumers who have enrolled in DCA receive overdraft coverage on
transactions not subject to 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.17(b) through Respondentâs
âstandardâ overdrali service, not through their enroliment in DCA.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs DCA Enrollment
Process in Respondentâs Stores in Violation of LFTA and Regulation E

Under Respondentâs store enrollment procedures, Respondentâs store
employees orally present DCA to new customers who are opening
consumer-checking accounts and request those new customers to orally
indicate whether they want to enroll following that presentation.
Respondentâs store employees then document the new customer's oral

enrollment preference in Respondentâs account-opening computer system.
16.

U7.

18.

19,

Under Respondentâs store enrollment procedures, Respondentâs store
employees do not print and present new customers with a written overdraft
notice (DCA Form) until the end of the account-opening process.

The printed DCA Form that Respondentâs store employces present to new
customers is pre-marked with a checked box to reflect the customerâs oral
enrollment preference from earlier in the account-opening process.
Respondentâs employees print the Form with the âEnrolled in TD Debit
Card Advanceâ option selected for consumers who stated they want DCA.
Respondent prints the Form with the âNot Enrolled tn TD Debit Card
Advanceâ option selected for consumers who stated they did not want DCA.
Under Respondentâs store procedures, through December 31, 2018, new
customers did not receive written disclosures about Respondentâs overdraft
services before receiving the DCA Form at the end of the account-opening
process.

Respondentâs store employees present this DCA Form together with
Respondentâs account-opening authorization form. New customers must
sign both forms to complete the account-opening process.

The DCA Form and account-opening authorization form are pre-filled by
Respondentâs computer system with all relevant customer and account

information.

Since January 27, 2014, it has been Respondentâs policy that a new customer
must sign both a DCA Form indicating whether the customer is enrolling
and an account-opening authorization form in order to open a consumer-
checking account regardless of whether the customer enrolls in DCA.

Under Regulation E, a financial institution may not charge Covered
Overdraft Fees untess it first â[o]btains the consumerâs affirmative consent,
or opt-in, to the institutionâs payment of ATM or one-time debit card
transactions.â 12 C.F.R. 8 1005.17(b) 1).

A financial institution must provide a consumer with the written (or, if the
consumer agrees, electronic) notice required by 12 CLFLR. Â§ 1005.17(b)( DG)
before it can obtain that consumerâs affirmative consent as required by 12
C.F.R. 8 1005.17(bC GiÂ».

As described in paragraphs 14-18 above, through December 31, 2018,
Respondent requested that new customers orally provide their DCA
enrollment preference before providing them with written notice describing
the DCA service.

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs oral enrollment preference when Respondent
obtains that oral decision before providing the customer the written notice

required by 12 C.FLR. Â§ 1003.17()C)G).

Under Respondentâs store procedures, Respondent prints the DCA Form
with a pre-checked box indicating the new customer's DCA enrollment
decision and presents that Form to the new customer at the end of the
account-opening process.

By the time Respondent provides new customers with a single DCA Form
for their signature in Respondentâs stores, the DCA Form is already marked
with their enrollment preference.

[f new customers who previously indicated that they wished to enroll want

they must affirmatively seek a different version of the DCA Form without
their previous enroliment preference pre-marked.,

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs signature on a DCA Form that is already
marked with the customer's enrollment preference and that all new
customers are required to sign to open a consumer-checking account.
During the Relevant Period, Respondent charged approximately 1.42 milhon
Affected Consumers Covered Overdraft Fees.

As a result, Respondent charged Covered Overdraft Fees without obtaining
consumersâ affirmative consent to enroll in DCA, in violation of EFTA, 15

Findings and Conclusions as te KRespondentâs DCA Enrollment Process at
Offsite Account-Opening Events in Violation of EF TA and Regulation

Respondentâs employees also open consumer-checking accounts at events
held outside of Respondent's stores, including at local colleges or
businesses.

For these offsite account-opening events, Respondent uses a different
account-opening authorization form that consumers must sign to open a new
checking account.

Respondentâs offsite account-opening authorization form features a box to
check to enroll in DCA, along with additional customer-information fields
and certain terms and conditions for Respondentâs checking accounts. This
form does not disclose any information regarding DCA.

For offsite account-opening events, Respondent's employees are also
required to bring DCA Forms for all new customers to sign.

But before early 2015, Respondentâs employees often did not bring the DCA
Form to offsite account-opening events.

Even after early 2015, Respondentâs employees in some cases still failed to
bring the DCA Form to offsite account-opening events.

When Respondentâs employees failed to bring the DCA Form to offsite
account-opening events, Respondent still opened consumer-checking

accounts and enrolled new customers in DCA following those events.

When Respondentâs employees failed to bring the DCA Form to offsite
account-opening events, Respondent obtained consumersâ DCA enrollment
decisions without providing customers with the DCA Form for their
signature and before providing them with any written disclosure describing
DCA.

In early 2015, Respondent instructed employees at offsite account-opening
events to elicit an oral enrollment preference from a new customer and then
to fill out the DCA Form on behalf of the new customer-ââincluding marking
the new customer's DCA enroliment preferenceâbetore later providing the
customer the DCA Form for their signature.

Following offsite account-opening events, Respondentâs employees use the
consumer information captured in the offsite account-opening form and
DCA Form to open new checking accounts for the new customers who
attended those events.

A financial institution must provide a consumer with the notice required by

consent as required by 12 C.PF.R. $ 1005.170b)C1 Ga).

Respondent instructed its employees to fill out DCA Forms on behalf of new
customers at offsite account-opening eventsâincluding marking a new
customerâs oral DCA enroliment preferenceâbetore presenting the DCA
Form to new customers for their signature.

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs oral enrollment preference, because
Respondent does not provide the customer the written notice required by 12
C.F.R. 8 1005.17(>) 1G) before obtaining that oral decision.

Respondent directed its employees to complete the DCA Form with the
customerâs information and selected enrollment option. This meant that by
the time Respondent's emplovees presented new customers with a DCA
Form for their signature at offsite account-opening events, that DCA Form
had been marked with their enrollment preference.

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs signature on a DCA Form that is already
marked with the customerâs enrollment preference and that all new

customers are required to sign to open a consumer-checking account.

Respondentâs employees also failed to bring DCA Forms to offsite account-
opening events to present to new customers for their signature, but still
enrolled customers in DCA at these events.

When Respondentâs employees failed to bring DCA Forms to offsite
account-opening events, they obtained new customersâ DCA enrollment
decisions without providing them with Respondentâs DCA Form for their
signature and before providing them with any other written disclosure
describing DCA.

Respondent charged new customers who enrolled in DCA at offsite account-
opening events Covered Overdraft Fees.

As aresult, Respondent charged Covered Overdraft Fees without obtaining
these consumersâ affirmative consent to enroll in DCA, in violation of

Respondent did not create a script for store employees to use to present DCA
to new customers before requesting their oral enrollment decision.
Respondent's managers created their own talking points and scripts tor
Respondent's employees to use to explain DCA to new checking-account
customers in the stores they supervised.

Respondentâs managers instructed employees, for their oral presentation of
DCA to new customers, to: (1) present DCA as a âfreeâ service or benefit,
while downplaying the tees and disclosures associated with the service; and
(2) frame DCA as a âfeatureâ or âpackageâ that âcomes withâ all new
consumer-checking accounts, rather than as an option that new customers
must opt in to.

In fact, (1) DCA is not a âfreeâ service or benefit; and (2) DCA is not a
âfeatureâ of Respondentâs checking accounts and does not âcome withâ all
new consumer-checking accounts.

In some cases during the store and offsite account-opening process,
Respondent also represented, expressly or by implication, that: (1) enrolling
in DCA would allow Respondent to pay transactions-âincluding a morigage
or light bill-âlikely already covered by Respondent's standard overdraft
service; and (2) enroliment in DCA is a default setting required to open a

new consumer-checking account.

In fact, (1) DCA pays Covered Transactions only, while remaining

Under Respondentâs procedures, Respondentâs employees do not provide
new customers with a DCA Form for their signature until the end of the
account-opening process.

The DCA Form that Respondentâs employees present to new customers in

Through a misleading or incomplete oral presentation of the DCA service
for the purpose of eliciting an oral-enrollment decision, and then by not
providing new customers with the pre-marked DCA Form until the end of
the account-opening process, or not providing the DCA Form at all,
Respondent materially interfered with consumersâ ability to understand the
terms and conditions of DCA.

In certain instances, Respondentâs employees further materially mtertered
with consumersâ ability to understand the terms and conditions of DCA by:
requiring new customers to sign DCA Forms with the âenrolledâ option pre-
checked without mentioning the DCA service at ail; enrolling new
customers in DCA without requesting the customerâs oral enroliment
decision; and deliberately obscuring, or attempting to obscure, the DCA
Form to prevent a new customer's review of their pre-marked âenrolledâ
Status.

Section LO36(a\1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits abusive acts or practices. 12

Section 1036(a\(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or practices. 12
ULS.C. 8 3536(a)C1 (8).
As described in Paragraph 54, in connection with the marketing, promoting,
offering for sale, or sale of DCA, in numerous instances, Respondent
represented, expressly or tmpliedly, that: (1) DCA is a âtreeâ service or
benefit; and (2) DCA ts a âfeatureâ or âpackageâ that âcomes withâ all new
consumer-checking accounts.
In fact, (1) DCA is not a âfreeâ service or benefit; and (2) DCA is not a
âfeatureâ of Respondentâs checking accounts and does not âcome withâ all
new consumer-checking accounts.
Further, as described in Paragraph 56, in connection with the marketing,
promoting, offering for sale, or sale of DCA, Respondent represented,
expressly or impliedly, that: (1) enrolling in DCA would allow Respondent
to pay transactionsâincluding a mortgage or light billâlikely already
covered by Respondentâs standard overdraft service; and (2) enrollment in

DCA is a default setting required to open a new consumer-checking account.

In fact, (1) DCA pays Covered Transactions only, while remaining
transactions are covered by Respondentâs standard overdraft service; and (2)
Respondent does not offer a consumer-checking account for which
enrollment in DCA ts required. A consumer-checking account does not
include DCA unless a consumer chooses to enroll in DCA.

Thus, Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraphs 69 and 71
constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and

1036(a)(1)\(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 88 5531 (a), 5536(a)C1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Deceptive Acts or Practices

When Presenting DCA to Existing Customers by Phone
Respondent permits consumers who have a checking account with
Respondent to enroll a new or existing checking account in DCA over the
phone.

For existing checking-account customers enrolling in DCA over the phone,
Respondent requires its employees to read (or play an automated version of)
a scripted disclosure regarding overdraft fees and the transactions covered
by DCA when obtaining a consumerâs enrollment decision.

During phone enroliments, tn certain instances, Respondentâs employees
represented that DCA covers check transactions, mortgage payments, car
payments, utility bills, and other recurring-bill payments, rather than only

Covered Transactions.

But enroliment in DCA is not required to cover check transactions, utility
bills, or other recurring bull payments. Respondentâs standard overdraft
service covers those transactions.

On other calls, Respondentâs phone employees stated that DCA takes effect
on the date of enrollment, including to a consumer who wished to use the
service immediately, and implied that enrolling in DCA would allow
customers to exceed Respondentâs daily ATM withdrawal limit of $750
while incurring only one Covered Overdratt Fee.

But DCA takes effect the next business day following enrollment. And
enrollment does not allow a consumer to exceed Respondentâs daily $750
ATM withdrawal limit. Consumers enrolled in DCA are still subject to
Respondentâs $750 ATM withdrawal limit, and would incur multiple
Covered Overdratt Fees if withdrawing more than that amount.

Section 1036(a\1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or practices. 12
ULS.C. 8 3536(a)C1 (8).

As described in Paragraph 76, in connection with the marketing, promoting,

In fact, (1) DCA takes effect the next business day following enroliment,
and (2) consumers would incur multiple Covered Overdraft Fees if
withdrawing more than Respondentâs $750 ATM withdrawal limit.

In those marketing mailers, Respondent advertised DCA as âallowling]â
Respondent âto cover all types of transactions, including ATM, one-time
debil card transactions, checks, automatic bill payments, online banking
transfers, and payments through bill pay, at our discretion.â

Consumers who enroll in DCA receive coverage on checks, automatic bill
payments, online banking transfers, or payments through bill pay through
Respondentâs standard overdralt service, not through their enrollment in
DCA,

In the same marketing mailer, Respondent described its standard overdraft
service as covering â|cjhecks and recurring items onlyâ and as covering
âchecks and recurring payments, such as mortgage payments or monthly
utility bills}...

Transactions such as âonline banking transfersâ and âpayments through bill
pay.â which Respondent presented as being âcoverjed]? by DCA but not
Respondent's standard overdratt service, are in fact covered by
Respondentâs standard overdralt service.

two NSCRAs until it implemented a furnishing policy relating to one of the

NSCRAs in July 2016.

Respondent also failed to implement policies or procedures for handling
NSCRA furnishing disputes until it implemented a policy relating to one of
the NSCRAs in August 2016.

Respondent did not implement a policy or procedure for investigating
disputes relating to furnishing information to the second NSCRA until April
2017.

Before at least June 2016, Respondent instructed consumers who called to
dispute information Respondent had furnished to at least one NSCRA to
contact the NSCRA, rather than to submit a Direct Dispute to Respondent.
Section 1022.42(a) of Regulation V, the implementing regulation of FCRA,
15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681, et seq., requires a Furnisher to establish and implement
reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and
integrity of the consumer information that it furnishes to a Consumer
Reporting Agency, and further provides that the policies and procedures
must be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of each
Furnisherâs activities. 12 C.P.R. Â§ 1022.42(a).

Through at least mid-2016, given the size, complexity, and scope of

Section 1022.42(b) of Regulation V requires that Furnishers consider
guidelines in Appendix E of the Furnisher Rule in developing appropriate
policies and procedures, and incorporate them where appropriate. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1022.42(b).

Appendix E of the Furnisher Rule includes guidelines for furnishing policies

and procedures that are reasonably designed to promote, among other things:

verifying random samples of information provided to consumer-reporting
agencies; conducting a periodic evaluation of a Furnisherâs own practices,
investigations of disputed information, and corrections of inaccurate
information; and maintaining records for a reasonable period in order to
substantiate the accuracy of any information about consumers it furnishes
that is subject to a Direct Dispute. Appendix FE to 12 C.F UR. Part 1022.
Through at least mid-2016, Respondent also failed to incorporate certain
elements in Appendix E, as appropriate, in its policies and procedures

complete its investigations, reviews, and reports, including reporting the
results of its investigation to an NSCRA, stemming from indirect disputes
concerning consumer information Respondent had furnished to one NSCRA
within 30 days or 45 days.

Respondent is unable to provide evidence of timely investigations of the vast
majority of indirect disputes concerning NSCRA furnishing that it received
prior to mid-2016.

After mid-2016, Respondent failed to investigate some indirect disputes
concerning information Respondent had furnished to one NSCRA within 30
days.

Section 623(b)(2) of FCRA requires a Furnisher to complete ail
investigations, reviews, and reports, including reporting the results of its
investigations to Consumer Reporting Agencies, stemming from an indirect
dispute concerning the completeness or accuracy of information furnished to
a Consumer Reporting Agency within 30 days. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(b)(Q).

Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the

penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes trom the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such olfset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will

ina Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Regional
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Settlement with TD Bank for
Illegal Overdraft Practices

AUG 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today
announced a settlement with TD Bank, N.A. regarding its marketing and sale of its optional
overdraft service: Debit Card Advance (DCA). TD Bank is headquartered in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, and operates about 1,250 locations throughout much of the eastern part of the
country. The Bureau found that TD Bank's overdraft enrollment practices violated the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and Regulation E by charging consumers overdraft fees
for ATM and one-time debit card transactions without obtaining their affirmative consent,
and that TD Bank engaged in deceptive and abusive acts or practices in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureau also found that TD Bank
engaged in practices prohibited by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its
implementing Regulation V. Todayâs consent order requires TD Bank to provide an
estimated $97 million in restitution to about 1.42 million consumers and to pay a civil
money penalty of $25 million.

The Bureau specifically found that TD Bank charged consumers overdraft fees for ATM and
one-time debit card transactions without obtaining their affirmative consent in violation of
EFTA and Regulation E, both after new customers opened checking accounts at TD Bank
branches and after new customers opened checking accounts at events held outside of
Bank branches.

The Bureau further found that when presenting DCA to new customers, TD Bank
deceptively claimed DCA was a âfreeâ service or benefit or that it was a âfeatureâ or
âpackageâ that âcomes withâ new consumer-checking accounts. In fact, TD Bank charges
customers $35 for each overdraft transaction paid through DCA and DCA is an optional
service that does not come with a consumer-checking account. When TD Bank enrolled
some consumers in DCA over the phone, TD Bank deceptively described DCA as covering
transactions unlikely to be covered by DCA. In some instances, TD Bank engaged in abusive
acts or practices by materially interfering with consumersâ ability to understand DCAâs terms
and conditions. In some cases, TD Bank: required new customers to sign its overdraft notice
with the âenrolledâ option pre-checked without mentioning the DCA service to the
consumer at all; enrolled new customers in DCA without requesting the customer's oral
enrollment decision; and deliberately obscured, or attempted to obscure, the overdraft
notice to prevent a new customer's review of their pre-marked âenrolledâ status in DCA.

The Bureau also found that TD Bank violated FCRA and Regulation V by failing to establish
and implement reasonable written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and
integrity of consumer-account information it furnished to two nationwide specialty
consumer reporting agencies. The Bureau also found that TD Bank failed to conduct timely
investigations of indirect consumer disputes concerning its furnishing to one of those
specialty agencies.

To provide relief for consumers affected by TD Bank's unlawful overdraft enrollment
practices, the Bureauâs consent order requires TD Bank to provide an estimated $97 million
in restitution to about 1.42 million consumers. TD Bank must also pay a civil money penalty
of $25 million. The consent order also requires TD Bank to correct its DCA enrollment
practices, stop using pre-marked overdraft notices to obtain a consumer's affirmative
consent to enroll in DCA, and adopt policies and procedures designed to ensure that TD
Bank's furnishing practices concerning nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies
comply with all applicable Federal consumer financial laws.

The consent order is available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_td-

20. A judgment for monetary relief is entered in favor of the Bureau and against

redress to Affected Consumers; however, full payment of this judgment will be suspended upon

under this Section, and will have no right to contest the manner of distribution chosen by the

27. If upon motion by the Bureau, the Court determines that any Defendant has failed to

material misrepresentation or omission, including materially misstating the value of any asset,
the Court shall terminate the suspension of the monetary judgment entered in Section III and
without further adjudication, shall reinstate the judgment entered in Section III of this Order and

V
Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

30. Under Section 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law alleged in the Complaint and taking into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§
5565(c)(3), a judgment for a civil money penalty is entered in favor of the Bureau and against
each Defendant, in the amount of $1. This amount is based on each Defendantâs limited ability

to pay as attested to in his financial statements listed in Section IV above.

31. Within 10 days of the Effective Date, each Defendant must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in compliance with the

Bureauâs wiring instructions.

32. The civil money penalty paid under this Order will be deposited in the Civil Penalty
Fund of the Bureau as required by Section 1017(d) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

33. Defendants must treat the civil money penalty paid under this Order as a penalty paid
to the government for all purposes. Regardless of how the Bureau ultimately uses those funds,
Defendants may not:

a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Order; or

b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification from
any source, including but not limited to payment made under any insurance
policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this Order.

Individual Defendants agree that the civil penalty imposed by the Order represents a civil
penalty owed to the United States Government, is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss,
and, thus, as to Individual Defendants, it is not subject to discharge under the Bankruptcy Code
under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 523(a)(7).

VI

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

34. In the event of any default on Defendantsâ obligations to make payment under this
Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as amended, will accrue on any outstanding
amounts not paid from the date of default to the date of payment, and will immediately become
due and payable.

35. Defendants relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid under this
Order to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be returned to
Defendants.

36. The facts alleged in the Complaint will be taken as true and be given collateral
estoppel effect, without further proof, in any proceeding based on the entry of the Order, or in

any subsequent civil litigation by or on behalf of the Bureau, including in a proceeding to

enforce its rights to any payment or monetary judgment under this Order, such as a
nondischargeability complaint in any bankruptcy case.

37. The facts alleged in the Complaint establish all elements necessary to sustain an
action by the Bureau under Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§
523(a)(2)(A), and for such purposes this Order will have collateral estoppel effect against each
Defendant, even in such Defendantâs capacity as debtor-in-possession.

38. Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Defendants, unless they already have done so, must furnish
to the Bureau their taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be used for purposes of
collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount arising out of this Order.

39. Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, Order, or settlement in a Related
Consumer Action, Defendants must notify the Enforcement Director of the final judgment,
Order, or settlement in writing. That notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that
Defendants paid or are required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of
consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid. To preserve the deterrent effect of the
civil money penalty in any Related Consumer Action, Defendants may not argue that
Defendants are entitled to, nor may Defendants benefit by, any offset or reduction of any
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the civil money penalty
paid in this action or because of any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty
Fund. If the court in any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of
compensatory monetary remedies imposed against Defendants based on the civil money penalty
paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund,
Defendants must, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction,
notify the Bureau and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a
payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the

amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

40. Upon written request, any consumer reporting agency must furnish consumer reports
to the Bureau concerning any Individual Defendant under Section 604(a)(1) of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681 b(a)(1), which may be used for purposes of collecting and

reporting on any delinquent amount arising out of this Order.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Takes Action Against Student-Loan Debt-
Relief Business and Its Owners for Taking Illegal Advance Fees

JUL 08, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled with
Timemark, Inc., a company based in Deerfield Beach, Florida, that provides debt-relief
services to consumers with federal student-loan debt, and with its owners and officers,
Timothy Lenihan, Sr., Mark Nagler, and Casey Gassaway. The Bureau alleged that the
defendants charged illegal advance fees in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR)
to consumers who were seeking to renegotiate, settle, reduce, or alter the terms of their
loans. If entered by the court, the proposed order memorializing the settlement will
permanently ban defendants from providing debt-relief services and impose a judgment
totaling approximately $3.8 million in consumer redress and civil money penalties.

The Bureau's complaint, which was filed in federal district court for the Southern District of
Florida, alleged that from 2016 through October 2019, the defendants used telemarketing
campaigns to convince more than 7,300 consumers to pay up to $699 in fees to file
paperwork to reduce or eliminate their monthly payments for their federal student loans,
through loan consolidation, forgiveness, or income-driven repayment plans. The U.S.
Department of Education, however, offers these options to student loan borrowers for free.
Moreover, under the TSR, it is illegal to request or receive any fees for debt-relief services
sold through telemarketing before the terms of the debt are altered or settled, and the
consumer has made at least one payment pursuant to the new arrangement. The Bureau
alleges that the defendants violated the TSR because they requested and received
payments from consumers within a few days, or at the latest, within 30 days of their
enrollmentâbefore the terms of the debts were altered.

If entered by the court, under the terms of the proposed order, the defendants would be
permanently banned from providing debt-relief services. The order would impose a
judgment on the defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of about $3.8 million for
consumer redress. Full payment of this amount will be suspended if, within 10 days after the
order is entered, Timemark pays $5,000, Nagler pays $7,000, and Gassaway pays $10,000.
The full amount of redress was suspended because of defendantsâ limited ability to pay
more based on sworn financial statements. The defendants would also be required to each
pay a $1 civil money penalty, in light of their financial circumstances. Whenever the Bureau
collects a civil money penalty through an enforcement action, that penalty is deposited into
the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. Assuming continued available funds, the Bureau will work
to provide full redress to eligible harmed consumers from this fund.

17. As of 2010, the Chicago MSA included about 1.6 million African-
American residents.

18. As of 2010, the Chicago MSAâs population was 9,461,105, of which 17%
were African Americans. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 30.1% of the
residents of the City of Chicago were African Americans.

19. As of 2010, 18.7% of the Chicago MSAâs 2,215 census tracts were
majority-African-American, and 13.8% were high-African-American.

20. From 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew about 2,700 mortgage-loan
applications from and originated about 1,800 mortgage loans in the Chicago MSA.

21. From 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew over 90% of its mortgage-
loan applications for properties within the Chicago MSA.

Townstoneâs Marketing

22. Since at least 2014, Townstone has engaged 1n acts or practices directed
at prospective applicants that, together and separately, would discourage prospective
applicants, on the basis of race, from seeking or obtaining credit for properties within
the Chicago MSA.

23. Townstoneâs business model has been to market and draw mortgage-
loan applications primarily through radio advertising.

24. Starting at least as early as 2014, âTownstone has marketed through âThe

Townstone Financial Show,â its own radio show and podcast.
jena
;

25. Townstone has generated up to 90% of its mortgage-loan applications
from radio advertising, including through the Townstone Financial Show.

26. The Townstone Financial Show is a long-form commercial
advertisement, which Townstone refers to as an infomercial, that also includes shorter
advertisements for Townstone during commercial breaks. Since 2014, the Townstone
Financial Show hosts have discussed mortgage-related issues on the show and have
taken questions from prospective applicants. âThe hosts have regularly referred to their
work at Townstone and promoted the benefits that prospective applicants might
expect from applying for mortgage loans from âTownstone.

27. Since about January 2015, the Townstone Financial Show has been co-
hosted by Sturner and another senior loan officer.

28. Townstoneâs website and the Townstone Financial Show have described
the hosts of the Townstone Financial Show as âChicago real-estate experts.â

29. Starting at least as early as 2014, the Townstone Financial Show was
conducted weekly on AM radio and reached the entire Chicago MSA. A weekly
podcast of the radio show has been available exclusively online. Townstone Financial
Show radio broadcasts and podcasts have been available on the Townstone website.
Both the radio show and podcast have been streamed on Facebook Live and then
advertised on Facebook, âTwitter, and LinkedIn.

30. The hosts have typically started the Townstone Financial Show podcasts

by stating Townstoneâs licensing information, including that Townstone is a licensed

6
jena
;

mottgage broker/banker, NMLS number 136639, Illinois residential-mortgage
licensee number 6629.

31. The Townstone Financial Show radio broadcasts have typically included
an introductory statement such as: âThis show is brought to you by Townstone
Financial, the home-loan expert since 2002. Townstone Financial is an Indiana,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Illinois mortgage licensee 6629, NMLS 136639.
Remember no one values your mortgage business more than Townstone Financial.â

32. The Townstone Financial Show has regularly included statements that
would discourage African-American prospective applicants from applying for
mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an application, including from Townstone;
would discourage prospective applicants living in majority- or high-African-American
neighborhoods from applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an
application, including from Townstone; and would discourage prospective applicants
from applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an application, for
properties in majority- or high-African-American neighborhoods, including from
Townstone.

33. For example, during a January 2014 broadcast in which Townstone
marketed its services, a caller from Markham, Illinois, asked how he and his wife
could improve their credit scores. Markham 1s a city in Cook County, Illinois, and its
population ts 80.3% African American, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Referring to the women of this predominately African-American area, the Townstone

7
Financial Showâs host responded that â[youâve] got to keep those women in line over
there in Markham.â The host went so far as to presume that the caller should âstop
spending freaking money [on his wife] and tell her to get a better job.â While
discussing the coupleâs credit concerns, the host turned his comments toward
Markham generally, claiming that âitâs crazy in Markham on weekendsâ and stating, âT
know, Iâve been to Markham.â âYou drive very fast through Markham,â he
continued, âand you donât look at anybody or lock on anybodyâs eyes in

Markham .... You look at your dashboard, you donât lock on anybody.â

34. In another January 2014 broadcast of the Townstone Financial Show,
during which âTownstone marketed its services, Townstoneâs then-president
encouraged listeners that ââitâs a great time to buy, itâs a great time to rent, itâs a great
time to sell.â The showâs hosts, including a local realtor and a bankruptcy attorney,
then recommended that listeners preparing a home for sale should âtake down the
Confederate flag.â

35. Ina June 2016 episode of the Townstone Financial Show, during which
Townstone marketed its services, before discussing the mortgage-lending services that
Townstone could provide to police officers and others, Sturner volunteered his view
of the South Side of Chicago. The South Side refers to the southern neighborhoods in
the City of Chicago and 1s majority-African-American, with about 489,000 African
American or Black residents. According to Sturner, that part of the city between

Friday and Monday 1s âhoodlum weekend,â and the police are âthe only ones between

8
that [area] turning into a real war zone and keeping it where itâs kind of at.â

36. Ina January 2017 episode of the Townstone Financial Show, during
which âTownstone marketed its services, the hosts discussed a now-replaced grocery
store in downtown Chicago that was part of the Jewel-Osco grocery-store chain.
Sturner described â[having] to go to the Jewel on Division,â which he referred to as
âJungle Jewel.â Sturner described the âJungle Jewelâ as âa scary place,â attributing his
fear and the storeâs nickname to the âJungle Jewelâsâ patrons who âpackedâ the store
and âwere people from all over the world.â

37. Ina November 2017 episode of the Townstone Financial Show, during
which Townstone marketed its services, Townstoneâs senior loan officer discussed a
recent skydiving experience and the ensuing ârushâ from the jump; another
Townstone host responded that he thought skydiving was crazy and suggested that
someone âwalking through the South Side at 3AM [would] get the same rush.â

38. Through the Townstone Financial Show, Townstone has characterized
areas and people in a manner that would discourage those who identify or associate
with those areas or people from applying for credit. For example, the Townstone
Financial Showâs hosts have disparaged majority-African-American areas as âhoodlum
weekendâ and approaching âa real war zoneâ or as âcrazyâ and places âto be driven
through quicklyâ while avoiding eye contact; they have referred to a place with

âpeople from all over the worldâ as a âjungleâ and âscaryâ; they have disparaged the

women of a predominantly African-American area; and their home-selling advice has
included recommendations regarding displays of the Confederate flag.

39. A prospective applicant is reasonable to consider statements made by
loan officers, realtors, and others marketing themselves as real-estate experts when
making decisions about a property or seeking credit. And a reasonable prospective
applicant would consider the characteristics of prospective neighborhoods, including
the neighborhoodsâ safety or dangerousness, when making decisions about a property
or seeking credit.

40. Even though African Americans made up 30% of the population of the
City of Chicago, Townstone has not targeted any marketing toward African
Americans in the Chicago MSA.

41. Townstone has engaged in unlawful conduct by engaging tn acts or
practices that would discourage African-American prospective applicants from
applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an application, including from
Townstone; would discourage prospective applicants living in majority- or high-
African-American neighborhoods from applying for mortgage loans, or making or
pursuing an application, including from Townstone; and would discourage
prospective applicants from applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an
application, for properties in majority- or high-African-American neighborhoods,

including from Townstone.

10
Applications from African-American Neighborhoods

42. Based on HMDA data from 2014 through 2017, Townstone received an
average of 740 mortgage-loan applications each year. Townstone brokered an average
of 60 total Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration home loans
each yeat.

43. Townstone has drawn few applications from African-American
applicants throughout the Chicago MSA. From 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew
about 2,700 applications, of which only 37 (1.4%) came from African Americans in
the Chicago MSA. During the same period, other mortgage lenders 1n the Chicago
MSA drew 1,217,223 applications, of which 119,370 (9.8%) came from African-
American applicants.

44. Similarly, from 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew almost no
applications from applicants applying for mortgage loans for properties in majority-
African-American neighborhoods. During the same period, âTownstone drew an
average of five or six applications each year (0.8%, 0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.9% of all
Townstone applications) for properties in high-African-American neighborhoods,
even though such neighborhoods made up 13.8% of the Chicago MSAâs census tracts.
Of Townstoneâs five or six applications each year for properties in high-African-
American neighborhoods (more than 80% African American), more than half each

year were from non-Hispanic white applicants.

45. Similarly, only 2.3%, 1.4%, 1.4%, and 2.2% of Townstoneâs applications
for the years 2014 through 2017, respectively, came from applicants applying for
mortgage loans for properties in majority-African-American areas, even though 18.7%
of the Chicago MSAâs census tracts were majority-African-American.

46. Statistical analyses of Townstoneâs mortgage-loan applications in the
Chicago MSA, as compared to its peer lenders during the same period, show
disparities between Townstone and its peers in drawing mortgage-loan applications
for properties in African-American neighborhoods.

47. These disparities are statistically significant and demonstrate that there
were applicants seeking mortgage loans for properties in African-American
neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA from âTownstoneâs peers in much higher
proportions than from Townstone.

48. Townstone had no legitimate, non-discriminatory reason to draw
relatively few applications for mortgage loans for properties in these majority-African-
American areas.

49. Townstone drew a significantly smaller proportion of mortgage-loan
applications for properties in majority-African-American neighborhoods than did its
peer lenders operating in the Chicago MSA. While Townstone drew 2.3%, 1.4%,
1.4%, and 1.3% of its applications for properties in majority-African-American
neighborhoods from 2014 through 2017, respectively, Townstoneâs peers drew many

times moreâ8.2%, 7.6%, 7.7%, and 8.1%.

50. Similarly, Townstone drew a significantly smaller proportion of
mortgage-loan applications for properties in high-African-American neighborhoods
than its peers operating in the Chicago MSA. While âTownstone drew only 0.8%,
0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.9% of its applications for mortgage loans for properties in high-
African-American census tracts from 2014 through 2017, respectively, other similar
lenders drew 5.3%, 4.9%, 5.1%, and 5.5% of their applications from such census
tractsâ6.3, 6.2, 7.7 and 6.1 times that of Townstone.

51. Townstone employed 17 loan officers from 2014 through 2017.
Townstone did not employ an African-American loan officer during that period, even
though it was aware that hiring a loan officer from a particular racial or ethnic group
could increase the number of applications from members of that racial or ethnic
eroup.

52. âTownstoneâs hiring practices, consumer outreach, consumer
interactions, and other business acts or practices exclude or treat differently African-
American prospective applicants for credit, as well as prospective applicants for credit
in African-American census tracts.

Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

61. âTownstoneâs ECOA violations, described above in Count 1, constitute

COUNT 3: FRAUDULENT TRANSFERâSTURNER

62. The Bureau incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1-52 here by
reference.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Files Suit Against Mortgage Creditor for
Discriminatory Mortgage-Lending Practices

JUL 15, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
lawsuit against Townstone Financial, Inc., a nonbank retail-mortgage creditor based in
Chicago, for violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA); its implementing
regulation, Regulation B; and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). ECOA and
Regulation B prohibit mortgage lenders from discriminating against applicants in credit
transactions on the basis of race, color, national origin, or other prohibited bases. ECOA
and Regulation B also prohibit mortgage lenders from making statements, or engaging in
acts or practices, that would discourage, on a prohibited basis, applicants or prospective
applicants from applying for credit. The Bureau's complaint alleges that Townstone violated
ECOA and Regulation B by engaging in discriminatory mortgage-lending practices and that
these violations also constituted violations of the CFPA.

As alleged in the complaint, from 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew almost no
applications for properties in African-American neighborhoods located in the Chicago-
Naperville-Elgin Metropolitan Statistical Area (Chicago MSA) and few applications from
African Americans throughout the Chicago MSA. The Bureau's complaint, filed in federal
district court in the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that:

=Â» Townstone engaged in acts or practices, including making statements during its weekly
radio shows and podcasts through which it marketed its services, that illegally discouraged
prospective African-American applicants from applying to Townstone for mortgage loans;

= Townstone engaged in illegal redlining by engaging in acts or practices that discouraged
prospective applicants living in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA from
applying to Townstone for mortgage loans, including by making discouraging statements
during its weekly radio shows and podcasts through which it marketed its services; and

=Â» Townstone engaged in illegal redlining by engaging in acts or practices that discouraged
prospective applicants living in other areas from applying to Townstone for mortgage loans
for properties located in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA, including
by making discouraging statements during its weekly radio shows and podcasts through
which it marketed its services.

The Bureau's complaint seeks an injunction against Townstone, as well as damages, redress
to consumers, and the imposition of a civil money penalty.

The Bureau's complaint is not a finding or ruling that Townstone has violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in federal district court in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois is available here:

IV.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

Until approximately June 15, 2020, Respondent was a non-bank Remittance
Transfer Provider with its principal place of business in New York, New
York. Among other activities, Respondent provided international money
transfers, including Remittance Transfers.

Respondent is licensed in over 30 states and sent Remittance Transfers from

the United States to recipients in over 100 countries. Until approximately
June 15, 2020, Respondent provided Remittance Transfers at storefront
locations independently owned and operated by about 3,000 individual
agents located in storefronts across the country. Until about February 2020,
Respondent also provided Remittance Transfers over the internet and
through mobile applications.

Respondent is a âcovered personâ under the CFPA because it offered or
provided electronic-funds-transmission services and payment services. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), (15 )(A)iv), (15 (A)(vii).

Respondent is a Remittance Transfer Provider under EFTA because it
provided Remittance Transfers for consumers in the normal course of its
business. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(g)(3).

In 2010, EFTA was amended to create a new Â§ 919 of the EFTA. Section
919 requires Remittance Transfer Providers to provide disclosures to senders
of Remittance Transfers, pursuant to rules prescribed by the Bureau, and
also provides for specific cancellation, refund, and error resolution
procedures.

The Bureau issued rules to implement these requirements, which became
effective on October 28, 2013. These rules are known as the Remittance

Rule.
10.

11.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondent has been subject to the requirements of Â§ 919 of EFTA and the
Remittance Rule.

As described below, Respondent violated many of the Remittance Ruleâs
cancellation, refund, disclosure and error-resolution requirements and

engaged in deceptive acts or practices in providing Remittance Transfers.

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of EFTA and the Remittance Rule

12.

13.

14.

Respondent failed to process cancellation requests
in violation of the Remittance Rule

A Remittance Transfer Provider must âcomply with the requirements of

Â§ 1005.34 with respect to any oral or written request to cancel a Remittance
Transfer from the senderâ that provides certain required information and is
received within the Remittance Ruleâs cancellation timeframe requirements.
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(a).

A Remittance Transfer Provider must provide a refund within three business
days of receipt of a timely cancellation request. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(b).
Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule through at
least August 2019, Respondentâs practice was to require consumers who
initiated a Remittance Transfer at a storefront with one of its agents to

request cancellation only through that same agent.
15.

16.

17.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule through at
least August 2019, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(a) by failing to
accept valid cancellation requests via telephone and provide the requisite
refunds.

Respondent failed to resolve errors
in violation of EFTA and the Remittance Rule

If a consumer asserts an error consistent with the process required by the

Remittance Rule, the Remittance Rule and EFTA require Remittance

Transfer Providers to âinvestigate promptly and determine whether an error

occurred within 90 days of the assertion of an error.â 12 C.F.R. Â§

1005.33(c)(1); see also 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d)(1)(A).

The Remittance Rule broadly establishes five categories of errors, subject to

enumerated exceptions:

a. The consumer pays an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer;

b. The Remittance Transfer Provider makes a computational or
bookkeeping error;

c. The amount disclosed is not made available to the recipient;

d. The transferred funds are not available to the recipient on the date
disclosed; and

e. The consumer requests information or documentation. 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.33(a)(1).
18.

19.

20.

21.

If an error occurred, a Remittance Transfer Provider must then follow the
Remittance Ruleâs procedures for remedying the error, which may include a
refund of the Remittance Transfer, including fees.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule through at
least August 2019, Respondent did not identify errors under the Remittance
Rule and had no policies or procedures related to how to investigate and
respond to notices of error.

In addition, when a consumer called Respondent with a complaint about a
Remittance Transfer, Respondent only provided information over the phone
in response to that complaint and did not take any other action in response to
that complaint. Ifa consumer called and alleged an error that Respondent
could not appropriately resolve under the Remittance Rule by providing
information, Respondent did not process the consumerâs request. Instead,
Respondent required the consumer to contact the agent at the storefront at
which the transfer was originated.

Respondent frequently failed to investigate and determine whether a
Remittance Rule error occurred after consumers asserted errors and failed to
follow the Remittance Ruleâs error resolution procedures for any error

asserted over the phone that would have required responsive action, like
22.

providing refunds, resending transfers, or correcting an incorrect transfer
amount.

Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-
1(d)(1)(A) in cases when consumers properly notified Respondent and

Respondent failed to investigate and determine whether an error occurred.

Respondent failed to refund fees for date of availability errors in violation of

23.

24.

25.

EFTA and the Remittance Rule
Under Â§ 1005.33(a) of the Remittance Rule, it is generally an âerrorâ if a
Remittance Transfer Provider fails to make funds available to a designated
recipient by the date of availability stated in the receipt or disclosure that the
Provider must provide to a sender. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(a).
If a consumer appropriately asserts a date of availability error consistent
with the ruleâs requirements, Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(1)(B) requires a Remittance
Transfer Provider to refund the fees imposed on the Remittance Transfer
when the Provider fails to make the funds available to the recipient by the
date of availability identified in the transfer receipt. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B).
Respondentâs practice was to not refund fees to consumers if the transfer
was already received, even if the transfer was received after the date

disclosed on the receipt. But the Remittance Rule required Respondent to
26.

refund fees imposed on the transfer if the transfer occurred after the date
disclosed, regardless of whether the transfer was ultimately received.
When the consumer properly asserted a date of availability error and no
applicable exclusion applied, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(G1)(B) when it did not provide refunds of fees to consumers

when the transfer was received after the date disclosed.

Respondent failed to develop and maintain written policies and procedures
designed to ensure compliance with error resolution requirements of the

Remittance Rule
A Remittance Transfer Provider must develop and maintain written policies
and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Remittance Ruleâs
error resolution requirements, including 12 C.F.R. $$ 1005.33(c)(1), (c)(2),
or (d)(1). 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(g)(1).
For example, Remittance Transfer Providers must investigate promptly and
determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving a notice of
error. They further must provide to Remittance Transfer senders a written
explanation of the Providerâs findings and note the senderâs right to request
the documents on which the Provider relied in making its determination if no
error was found. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (d)(1).
Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule and

through at least 2019, Respondent had not developed or maintained written

policies and procedures necessary to ensure compliance with Â§Â§
1005.33(c)(1), (c)(2), or (d)(1).
Respondent therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(g)(1).

Respondent failed to provide required disclosures
in violation of EFTA and the Remittance Rule

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to make
specific disclosures to every consumer. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31.

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to disclose
âthe date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the
designated recipient, using the term âDate Availableâ or a substantially
similar term.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(b)(2)(i1). Remittance Transfer Providers
may provide a statement that funds may be available to the recipient earlier
than the date disclosed, using the term âmay be available soonerâ or a
substantially similar term. /d.

The electronic disclosures Respondent provided to consumers initiating
online Remittance Transfers used the term âEstimated Deliveryâ to
characterize the date of availability. Providing an âestimateâ of the date of
availability does not comply with the Remittance Rule. Respondent provided
about 180,000 disclosures using the âEstimated Deliveryâ language in 2019

alone.

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to disclose any
fees collected on the Remittance Transfer using the term âTransfer Feesâ or
a âsubstantially similar term.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(b)(1)qi).

For transfers initiated through Respondentâs agents at storefronts, customers
were provided with a disclosure listing four different kinds of fees: âService
fee,â âFee Rate,â âHandling fee,â (or âHandling,â) and âDiscount.â Since
the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule and through at
least 2019, Respondents provided about 40 million disclosures containing
these terms.

Those terms are not substantially similar to the term âTransfer Fees,â and are
not otherwise permissible under the Remittance Rule.

The EFTA requires a Remittance Transfer Provider to disclose a statement
containing âinformation about the rights of the sender under this section
regarding the resolution of errors.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(a)(2)B(i)(1). The
EFTA also established certain error and cancellation rights and certain
remedies available to senders. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d)(1)(A) & (B).

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to disclose to a
sender ââa statement about the rights of the sender regarding the resolution of

errors and cancellation, using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of

Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.â 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.3 1(b)(2)(iv).

Respondent did not provide a âstatement about the rights of the senderâ in a
form substantially similar to the Model Form A-37 language. Instead, the
receipt and disclosure Respondent provided to consumers contained
âconditions of serviceâ that included nearly a page of conditions not found
in the Model Form A-37. Those âconditions of serviceâ did not state that
senders âhave a right to dispute errors in your transactionâ or request a
written statement of rights, which are provisions contained in Model Form
A-37.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondent provided about 40 million disclosures containing these terms to
consumers.

Respondent therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31 when it (1) disclosed an
âEstimated Deliveryâ for the funds; (2) failed to appropriately disclose
transfer fees; and (3) provided inaccurate information about the rights of the

sender under EFTA.

regarding the speed of its Remittance Transfers
When offering one of its Remittance Transfer services, Respondent
represented that they provided âan instant to 24-hour delivery.â In
advertisements for its Remittance Transfer services generally, Respondent
advertised an âinstant transfer,â or a transfer âwithin minutes.â
But Respondent did not provide Remittance Transfers within the advertised
timeframes.
Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or abusiveâ
acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).
As described in Paragraph 42, in connection with the advertising, marketing,
promoting, offering for sale, or sale of its Remittance Transfer services, in
numerous instances, Respondent has represented, expressly or impliedly,
that the services had âan instant to 24-hour delivery,â would provide an
âinstant transfer,â or a transfer âwithin minutes.â
In fact, Respondent did not provide Remittance Transfers within the
advertised timeframes.
Thus, Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraph 42, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B)

of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 8Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)\(B).

Deceptive acts or practices by making misleading statements in disclosures

purporting to limit consumersâ error resolution rights
When consumers purchased Respondentâs Remittance Transfer services,
Respondent provided to the consumer a disclosure and receipt that included
statements that:
a. Error notices consumers submitted after 90 days would be accepted at
Respondentâs âoptionâ; and
b. Respondent âassumes no obligation except as stipulated hereinâ and âwill
not be responsible for non-performance or loss due to circumstances
beyond our control.â
But EFTA and the Remittance Rule require Remittance Transfer Providers,
including Respondent, to investigate and remedy errors when consumers
provide an error notice within 180 days of the promised date of delivery, not
the 90 days Respondent stated. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d)(1)(A); 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1005.33(b)(1)(i).
The Remittance Rule also provides that Remittance Transfer Providers,
including Respondent, are liable for errors, including acts of agents when
such agent acts for the Provider. This means that, contrary to Respondentâs
statement, Respondent may have been responsible for non-performance or
loss due to circumstances beyond its control or beyond the circumstances

stated in its disclosures.

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or abusiveâ
acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

As described in Paragraph 48, in connection with the advertising, marketing,
promoting, offering for sale, or sale of its Remittance Transfer services, in
numerous instances, Respondent has represented, expressly or impliedly,
that error notices consumers submitted after 90 days would be accepted at
Respondentâs âoption,â and that Respondent âassumes no obligation except
as stipulated hereinâ and âwill not be responsible for non-performance or
loss due to circumstances beyond our control.â

In fact, EFTA and the Remittance Rule require Remittance Transfer
Providers, including Respondent, to investigate and remedy errors when
consumers provide an error notice within 180 days of the promised date of
delivery, and the Remittance Rule also provides that Remittance Transfer
Providers, including Respondent, are liable for errors, including acts of
agents when such agent acts for the Provider.

Respondentâs misrepresentations about the acceptance of error notices were
likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances and

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification
from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any
insurance policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this
Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of

a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the

amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Remittance Transfer Providers
for Remittance Transfer Rule Violations

AUG 31, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) entered
into settlements with Trans-Fast Remittance LLC and Sigue Corporation and its subsidiaries,
SGS Corporation and GroupEx Corporation. Trans-Fast, which until recently was a
remittance transfer provider, is based in New York, New York and licensed in over 30 states.
Sigue and its subsidiaries, which are all headquartered in Sylmar, California, provide
consumers with international money-transfer services, including remittance-transfer
services. The Bureau found that Trans-Fast and Sigue and its subsidiaries violated the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and the Remittance Transfer Rule, which implements
EFTA. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act
of 2010's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. The consent orders require
the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose requirements to prevent future
violations. Sigue and its subsidiaries must also pay consumer redress. These actions reflect a
sweep of enforcement actions to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.

The Bureauâs investigation of Trans-Fast found that it violated EFTA and the Remittance
Transfer Rule by failing to adhere to error resolution requirements and properly respond to
cancellation requests, failing to provide refunds the Remittance Transfer Rule requires,
failing to maintain required policies and procedures, and failing to provide required
disclosures. Since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, Trans-Fast
provided about 40 million disclosures to consumers that violated the Remittance Transfer
Rule. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast engaged in deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA by making misleading statements in advertisements regarding the
speed of its remittance transfers and making misleading statements in disclosures
purporting to limit consumersâ error resolution rights.

The Bureauâs investigation of Sigue and its subsidiaries found that between 2013 and 2019,
they violated EFTA and the Remittance Transfer Rule. Specifically, the Bureau found that
Sigue and its subsidiaries failed to refund transaction fees when they did not make funds
available by the disclosed date of availability, and they failed to inform consumers of the
remedies available for remittance errors. When Sigue and its subsidiaries investigated
remittance errors, they failed to report to consumers in writing the results of their
investigations into transaction errors or consumersâ rights as required by the Rule. Sigue
and its subsidiaries also failed to develop and maintain adequate written policies and
procedures designed to ensure compliance with certain Remittance Transfer Rule error-
resolution requirements and failed to comply with several Remittance Transfer Rule
disclosure requirements.

The consent order against Trans-Fast requires it to pay a $1.6 million civil money penalty. If
Trans-Fast resumes offering remittance transfers, the consent order requires it to adopt a
compliance plan to ensure that its remittance transfer acts and practices comply with all
applicable Federal consumer financial laws and the consent order.

The consent order against Sigue and its subsidiaries requires them to pay about $100,000
in consumer redress and a $300,000 civil money penalty. They must also implement and
maintain written policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the
Remittance Transfer Rule and maintain a compliance-management system that is designed
to ensure that their operations comply with the Remittance Transfer Rule, including
conducting training and oversight of all agents, employees, and service providers, and not
violating the Remittance Transfer Rule in the future.

In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

U.S. EQUITY ADVANTAGE, INC.
and ROBERT M. STEENBERGH,

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
acts and practices of U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc. (USEA) and Robert M.
Steen bergh (Steenbergh) (collectively Respondents) regarding their marketing for
an automobile loan Payment Accelerator Program and has identified the following
violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, Â§ 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B);

12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 (a), 5536(a)(1)(B):

(1) Respondents misrepresent to consumers, when disclosing individualized
benefits, the interest savings they will realize from the program.
Respondentsâ disclosures project savings for each consumer, but fail to

account for the programâs $399 enrollment fee in calculating those
savings. In fact, the programâs cost will ordinarily exceed any savings
because of the enrollment fee it charges;
(2) Respondents misrepresent to consumers the âTotal Benefitâ of the
program; and
(3) Respondents misrepresent that they have helped hundreds of thousands
of customers save $29 million or more in interest by participating in
AutoPayPlus when Respondents have no basis for making this claim, and
in fact the program has not saved consumers anywhere near that amount.
Under Sections 1053 and 1055 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order (Consent

Order).

IV

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
USEA 1s a Florida corporation with its principal place of business at 800
North Magnolia Avenue, Suite 1275, Orlando, FL 32803.
Robert M. Steenbergh is the founder, President, Chief Executive Officer,
and ultimate owner of U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc., and he personally
directed or oversaw its practices in this matter.
Respondents, at all times material to this complaint, have collected and
transmitted consumer funds from consumers to their lenders or servicers,
activity that constitutes a consumer financial product or service covered by
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (15) (A) (iv). Respondents are both a
âcovered personâ and âservice providerâ as those terms are defined by 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6) and (26).
Given his status as an officer or employee charged with managerial
responsibility for USEA, acontrolling shareholder, and a shareholder who
materially participates in the conduct of the affairs of USEA, Steenbergh is

a ârelated personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C).
10.

11.

12.

13.

Because of his status as a ârelated personâ under the CFPA, Steenbergh is
deemed a âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).
Since November 2005, Respondents have offered a Payment Accelerator
Program called âAutoPayPlusâ (formerly called the âEquity Accelerator
Programââ).

Respondentsâ AutoPayPlus program, like many accelerator programs,
collects and applies one extra loan payment each year toward repayment of
consumerâs loans which, in theory, can substantially reduce the number of
loan payments and the interest paid over the life of the loan.

In the AutoPayPlus program, consumers authorize USEA to withdraw
portions of their regularly due car payments on an alternative schedule,
often corresponding to the consumersâ paydays.

For most of its customers, USEA makes these withdrawals bi-weekly.
USEA holds these payments, and then submits full payments to the
consumersâ lenders or other payees on the schedules set by those lenders
or payeesâusually monthly.

Because there are 52 weeks and 26 bi-weekly periods each year, USEA
withdraws the equivalent of thirteen monthly payments each year, instead

of twelve.

Respondents charge a âprogram fee,â sometimes called an âenrollment
fee,â to consumers in the AutoPayPlus program. Respondents apply a
consumerâs extra payments to this fee until it is paid in full, before
submitting any of the extra payments to the consumerâs lender.

Once Respondentsâ fees are paid, future extra payments are sent to
consumersâ lenders or payees.

During the Relevant Period, more than 100,000 consumers have enrolled
in AutoPayPlus.

Respondents enter into agreements with various auto dealerships to enroll
consumers in the AutoPayPlus program.

Those dealerships receive a commission based on the number of
consumers they enroll.

Respondents have entered into agreements to enroll customers in their
payment accelerator program with more than 900 dealerships.

Since at least July 21, 2011, Respondentsâ âprogram feeâ or âenrollment
feeâ has been $399.

Respondents charge a âconvenience feeâ or âdebit feeâ each time money is
withdrawn from consumersâ accounts, i.e., every two weeks for most

customers.
22.

23.

24.

Since January 2017, Respondentsâ âdebit feeâ or âconvenience feeâ has
been $2.45. Before January 2017, the debit fee was $1.95.

Respondents charge consumers a one-time âverification feeâ when they
process consumersâ authorization to withdraw money from their bank

accounts via Automated Clearing House withdrawals.

Since at least July 21, 2011, USEAâs âverification feeâ has been $0.95.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentsâ Misrepresentations Regarding

the Overall Benefits of AutoPayPlus
During the Relevant Period, Respondents provided dealerships with a web
portal or with software through which the dealerships can enroll customers
in the AutoPayPlus program.
Respondentsâ web portal and software generate customized disclosure
forms called âBi-Weekly Sales Toolsâ or âBenefits Disclosures.â
The benefits disclosures are based on individual consumersâ loan terms
and purport to describe the benefits and costs specific to individual
consumers.
Respondents instruct dealerships to provide every consumer with the
benefits disclosures to âguarantee accurate benefit disclosure.â
Respondents do not permit dealerships to change or manipulate the

benefits disclosures before presenting them to the consumer.

The disclosures purport to show potential savings after accounting for fees.
For example, the disclosures state: âCongrats! Your interest savings cover
service costs and you pocket $[ specific amount] in interest.â The
disclosures also state: âAll AutoPayPlus benefits have taken into
consideration and amortized the $399 program fee.â

Despite these representations about covering fees and taking into
consideration the enrollment fee, the costs and savings represented to
consumers in the disclosures fail to account for the $399 enrollment fee,
thereby overstating savings or understating costs to every consumer by
$399.

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondentsâ representations, as described in Paragraphs 25-31 constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and
1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 553 1(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

During the Relevant Period, Respondents enrolled over 100,000
consumers in AutoPayPlus. Tens of thousands of these consumers paid

the full enrollment fee on an interest-bearing loan.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentsâ Misrepresentations Concerning
âTotal Benefitâ

35. During the Relevant Period, Respondents state in disclosures provided to
consumers specific dollar savings amounts called the âIm proved Equityâ
and âTotal Benefit,â which refers to the reduced loan balance at a
particular time in the loan schedule.

36. But Respondents, while touting the âbenefitâ to consumers of enrolling in
AutoPayPlus in dollar terms, failed to disclose to consumers that any gain
in equity is caused by the fact that consumers are paying more money and,
in most cases, will end up having to pay more to USEA than the actual
value of the âbenefitâ to realize it.

37. Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

38. Respondentsâ representations, as set forth in Paragraphs 35-36, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and
1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 553 1(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

claim that USEA has helped hundreds of thousands of customers save $29
million or more in interest.

At all times that Respondents made these claims, they did not collect or
maintain data to support the claims, or otherwise have any reasonable basis
for them.

In fact, Respondentsâ customers have not achieved $29 million in interest
savings and Respondents have not calculated the actual total consumer
interest savings.

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondentsâ representations, as set forth in Paragraphs 39-41, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and

1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc.
and Its Owner, Robert M. Steenbergh, for Deceptive Sales Practices

NOV 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc. (âUSEAâ) and its owner, Robert M.
Steenbergh. The Bureau found that the companyâs disclosures and advertisements of its
auto loan payment program contained misleading statements in violation of the Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010's prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. Robert M.
Steenbergh is the founder, sole-owner, and chief executive officer of USEA, a nonbank
located in Orlando, Florida. The consent order imposes a judgment against them requiring
them to pay $9,300,000 in consumer redress and contains requirements to prevent future
violations.

USEA and Steenbergh operate an auto loan payment program called AutoPayPlus, which
charges fees to deduct payments from consumersâ bank accounts every two weeks and then
forwards those payments every month to the consumersâ lenders. The Bureau found that
USEA and Steenbergh misrepresented the amount consumers would save when disclosing
the program's benefits by not including a $399 enrollment fee in the calculations presented
to consumers. USEA and Steenbergh created the misleading impression that consumers
would save money using its product, when in fact, because of the enrollment fee, the
programâs costs ordinarily exceeded any savings. The Bureau also found that USEA and
Steenbergh stated in advertising that they have helped hundreds of thousands of customers
save $29 million or more in interest by participating in AutoPayPlus when they had no basis
for making this claim, and when the program had, in fact, not saved consumers that amount.
The Bureau found that more than 100,000 consumers were subject to USEAâs and
Steenberghâs deceptive practices and that consumers should receive $9,300,000 in redress
for fees they paid.

The ordered redress amount is suspended upon payment of $900,000 and a $1 civil money
penalty to the Bureau. The suspension of the full payment for redress, as well as the $1 civil
penalty, is based on USEAâs and Steenberghâs demonstrated inability to pay more based on
sworn financial statements. Consumers harmed by USEA and Steenbergh may be eligible
for additional relief from the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. If victims cannot be located or it is
otherwise not practicable to pay victims, the Bureau will keep the money in the Fund for
victims in future cases rather than the money being sent to the Treasury.

The consent order prohibits USEA and Steenbergh from making any misrepresentations
about its payment programs. It also requires them to account for the total costs for its
payment programs, as well as the net savings or costs after deducting any fees, whenever
they make claims about savings or financial benefits.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

4.

Respondent is a federally insured, for-profit national bank headquartered in
Seattle, Washington.

Respondent is an insured depository institution with total assets greater than
$10,000,000 within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5515(a). Respondentâs total
assets as of December 31, 2016, were about $14,873,654,000; its total assets
as of December 31, 2017, were about $15,584,013,000.

Respondent is a âcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§5481(6).

Respondent originated more than $1 billion in 2016 and $1 billion again in
2017 in home-purchase loans, including refinancings of home-purchase
loans.

On December 3 |st of both 2016 and 2017, Respondent had a branch office
that was approved by a federal agency in a Metropolitan Statistical Area

(MSA) for HMDA-reporting purposes.
10.

11.

12.

13.

14.

15.

16.

In 2016 and 2017, Respondent received applications for, originated, or
purchased over ftve Covered Loans related to properties in multiple MSAs
or Metropolitan Divisions.

Respondent is a federally insured or regulated entity. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.2.
Respondent is a depository institution required to report HMDA data as
defined in Regulation C, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.2.

Including refinancings of home-purchase loans, Respondent originated more
than 3,484 home-purchase loans in 2016 and 3,284 home-purchase loans in
2017.

Respondent reported data on over 7,000 Covered Loans on each of its 2016
and 2017 HMDA LARs. On March 1, 2017, Respondent submitted its 2016
HMDA LAR. On March 1, 2018, Respondent submitted its 2017 HMDA
LAR, and on May 24, 2018, resubmitted its 2017 LAR.

Respondentâs 2016 HMDA LAR submission and 2017 HMDA LAR
Submission and resubmission to the Bureau included significant errors that
exceeded the applicable thresholds.

An internal audit of Respondentâs 2016 HMDA LAR identified 40 files
containing errors in a review of 100 files, a 40% error rate.

A Bureau review of 84 files in Respondentâs initial 2017 HMDA LAR

identified 58 errors in 27 files, a 32% sample error rate.

With respect to Respondentâs resubmitted 2017 HMDA LAR, the Bureau
reviewed 81 files and identified 21 errors in 13 files, a 16% sample error
rate.

These sample error rates indicate the presence of large numbers of errors in
the LAR that exceed the applicable thresholds.

The 2016 HMDA errors were caused by a lack of appropriate staff,
insufficient staff training, and ineffective quality control.

The 2017 HMDA errors are directly related to weaknesses in Respondentâs
compliance-management system (CMS), especially in the areas of Board
and management oversight, monitoring, and policies and procedures.

In connection with its 2017 LAR resubmission, Respondent imposed an
incorrect policy, which directly led to the errors in its resubmitted LAR.
Respondent failed to put in place an adequate system of monitoring controls
that could promptly identify and correct weaknesses and violations in the
2016 and 2017 HMDA LAR.

The occurrence of errors in many different fields, rather than concentrated in
one or two fields, indicates broad CMS failures and a lack of adequate
resources, because the errors were not caught, and the errors cannot be

directly attributed to one or two systemic failures.
24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

The Bureau entered a consent order against Respondent on October 9, 2013,
finding that Respondent violated HMDA and Regulation C. The 2013
consent order required Respondent to review, correct, and resubmit its 2011
HMDA LAR and imposed a $34,000 penalty.

Respondent continued, after the Bureauâs 2013 consent order, to report
inaccurate HMDA data with error rates that exceed applicable thresholds.
Respondent has not maintained a CMS with procedures reasonably adapted
to avoid HMDA LAR errors, and thus the errors are intentional and not bona
fide errors.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions as to
Violations of HMDA and Regulation C

As implemented by Regulation C, HMDA requires covered institutions to
collect and report mortgage-loan data regarding applications for, originations
of, and purchases of home-purchase loans, home-improvement loans, and
refinancings for each calendar year. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2802(3), (5), 2803; 12
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1003.2 (definition of âfinancial institutionâ), 1003.4(a), (b).
Respondent is required to collect and report dataon Covered Loans in
compliance with HMDA and Regulation C. 12 U.S.C. Â§$ 2802(3), (5), 2803;

Respondentâs 2016 HMDA LAR submission and 2017 HMDA LAR
submission and resubmission to the Bureau included significant errors that
exceeded the applicable thresholds.
Between at least January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, Respondent did
not maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid errors in its HMDA
LAR.
Respondent knew or should have known of the inadequacies of its HMDA
compliance mechanisms and the substantial risk of HMDA reporting errors
in its 2016 and 2017 LAR submissions and 2017 resubmission.
Respondentâs HMDA-reporting errors are not bona fide errors within the
meaning of Regulation C. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.6(b).
Respondentâs 2016 and 2017 submissions and 2017 resubmission contained
errors, in violation of HMDA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2803, and Regulation C, 12
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1003.4, 1003.5.

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of the CFPA
Section 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA prohibits a covered person from offering
or providing to a consumer any financial product or service not in
conformity with âFederal consumer financial lawâ or otherwise committing
any act or omission in violation of a âFederal consumer financial law.â 12

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

42.

43.

44.

The Board must review all documents (including plans, reports, programs,
policies, and procedures) required by this Consent Order before submission
to the Bureau.

Although this Consent Order requires Respondent to submit certain
documents for review or non-objection by the Regional Director, the Board
will have the ultimate responsibility for proper and sound management of
Respondent and for ensuring that Respondent complies with the laws that
the Bureau enforces, including Federal consumer financial law and this
Consent Order.

In each instance that this Consent Order requires the Board to ensure
adherence to the Consent Order, or perform certain obligations of
Respondent, the Board must:

a. authorize whatever actions are necessary for Respondent to fully

comply with the Consent Order;
b. require timely reporting by management to the Board on the status of
compliance obligations; and
C. require timely and appropriate corrective action to remedy any
material non-compliance with any failures to comply with Board
directives related to this Section.
VII.

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalties

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

45.

46.

47.

48.

Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law and regulation described in Section IV of this Consent
Order, and taking into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3),
Respondent must pay a civil money penalty of $200,000 to the Bureau.
Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in
compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) ofthe CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under

this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
49.

the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment
made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil money
penalty paid under this Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
or monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of
the civil money penalty paid in this action. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the

amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law, and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Regional
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that Respondent paid
or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of

consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Settlement With Washington
Federal Bank, N.A. For Flawed Mortgage-Loan Data Reporting

OCT 27, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled
with Washington Federal Bank, N.A., a federally insured national bank, to address the
Bureauâs finding that it reported inaccurate Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data
about its mortgage transactions for 2016 and 2017. Inaccurate HMDA data can make it
difficult for the public and regulators to discover and stop discrimination in home mortgage
lending or for public officials and lenders to tell whether a community's credit needs are
being met. The settlement requires Washington Federal to pay a $200,000 civil money
penalty and develop and implement an effective compliance-management system to
prevent future violations.

The Bureau found that Washington Federal, headquartered in Seattle, Washington, violated
HMDA, its implementing regulation, Regulation C, and the Consumer Financial Protection
Act of 2010 (CFPA) by failing to report accurate data about its mortgage-loan applications
to the Bureau. Washington Federal is currently subject to a 2013 consent order with the
Bureau based on the Bureau's previous findings that Washington Federal violated HMDA
and Regulation C.

Washington Federal reported HMDA data for over 7,000 mortgage applications in each of
2016 and 2017. The Bureau found that these data included significant errors, with some
samples having error rates as high as 40%. The Bureau found that the errors in Washington
Federalâs 2016 HMDA data were caused by a lack of appropriate staff, insufficient staff
training, and ineffective quality control, and that the errors in its 2017 HMDA data were
directly related to weaknesses in Washington Federalâs compliance-management system.
Weaknesses were specifically found in the areas of board and management oversight,
monitoring, and policies and procedures. These significant errors in reported mortgage-
application data violated Regulation C and HMDA. These violations also constituted
violations of the CFPA.

The consent order is available at:
