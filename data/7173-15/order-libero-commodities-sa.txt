I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (““CFTC” or “Commission’) has reason to
believe that Libero Commodities SA (“Libero” or “Respondent”) violated Commission
Regulation (“Regulation”) 19,02, 17 C.F.R. § 19.02 (2014), since it began trading in May 2010,
and through April 29, 2014 (‘Relevant Period”). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

II.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement of Respondent Libero Commodities SA (“Offer”), which the
Commission has determined to accept. Without admitting or denying any of the findings and
conclusions herein, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings
Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), and acknowledges service of this Order.’

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding
brought by the Commission, other than a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this
Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings
consented to in the Offer or this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

Cotton merchants and dealers that hold or control reportable cotton futures positions
under Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 15.00(p)(1)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 15.00(p)(1)(1) (2014),
are required to file a CFTC Form 304 reporting their call cotton purchases and sales weekly as of
the close of business on Friday, and no later than two business days following the date of the
report pursuant to Regulations 19.00(a)(2) and 19.02, 17 C.F.R. §§ 19.00(a)(2), 19.02 (2014).
Throughout the Relevant Period, Respondent failed to comply with this requirement.

B. Respondent

Libero Commodities SA is an agricultural trading company with its principal office
located in Geneva, Switzerland, and maintains another office in Mato Grasso, Brazil. Libero has
never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Cc, Facts

Respondent is a cotton merchant or dealer. Whenever cotton merchants or dealers hold
or control at least 100 cotton futures positions, they are required by Regulations to file weekly
CFTC Form 304 reports with the Commission setting forth their call cotton purchases and sales
as of the close of business Friday, and are required to submit their CFTC Form 304 reports
within two business days. On approximately 200 occasions during the Relevant Period,
Respondent held or controlled at least 100 cotton futures positions but failed to file CFTC Form
304 reports as required. Upon discovering its omissions, Respondent voluntarily self-reported its
deficiency to the Commission in May 2014.

In accepting Respondent’s Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondent’s cooperation
in this matter, which included proactively and voluntarily analyzing its past trading activity since
its inception, and retroactively compiling and providing all of the back CFTC Forms 304 that
should have been filed with the Commission.

D. Legal Discussion

Pursuant to Regulation 19.00(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 19.00(a)(2) (2014), cotton merchants and
dealers that hold or control reportable cotton futures positions under Regulation 15.00(p)(1)(),
17 C.F.R. § 15.00(p)(1)(i) (2014), are required to file series "04 reports. Regulation
15.00(p)(1)(), in relevant part, defines a reportable position as any open contract position that
meets or exceeds the level set forth in Regulation 15.03, 17 C.F.R. § 15.03 (2014), in any one
futures contract on any reporting market at the close of the market on any business day. For
cotton futures positions, Regulation 15.03, 17 C.F.R. § 15.03 (2014), establishes 100 contracts as
the reporting level.
For cotton merchants and dealers with reportable positions, “CFTC Form 304 reports
showing the quantity of call cotton bought or sold on which the price has not been fixed, together
with the respective futures on which the purchase or sale is based” must be filed. 17 C.F.R. §
19.02(a) (2014). Call cotton refers to “spot cotton bought or sold, or contracted for purchase or
sale at a price to be fixed later based upon a specified future.” 17 C.F.R. § 19.02(a) (2014).

Each CFTC Form 304 report must be “made weekly as of the close of business on Friday and
filed . . . not later than the second business day following the date of the report.” 17 C.F.R. §
19,02(b) (2014).

By failing to file CFTC Form 304 reports as set forth above, on approximately 200
occasions during the Relevant Period, Respondent violated Regulation 19.02. See 17 C.F.R. §
19.02 (2014).

IV.
