proceeding filed by, on behalf of, or against him, whether inside or outside the United States; and

(2012), as set forth herein. The findings and conclusions in this Consent Order are not binding

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
(1) The Parties To This Consent Order

14. ‘Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an

independent federal regulatory agency, charged by Congress with administering and enforcing

4
Case 4:14-cv-00839-ODS Document 27 Filed 06/16/15 Page 4 of 16
the Act, 7 US.C. §§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 1.1-190.10 (2014).

15. | Defendant Gregory Christopher Evans is a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, and
between at least January 2013 through July 21, 2013 (the “relevant period’’), was employed as a
risk management consultant at a large futures commission merchant (“FCM”) and provisionally
registered swap dealer (“Swap Dealer’) (the “Firm’’) with offices located in Kansas City,
Missouri. Evans was registered as an associated person (“AP”) of the FCM from November 21,
2012, until his resignation on July 21, 2013, and acted as an AP of the Swap Dealer during the
period January 1, 2013, until his resignation on July 21, 2013.

(2) Fraudulent Unauthorized Trades

16. Asarisk management consultant, Evans entered into bilateral energy swap
agreements on behalf of the Firm with the Firm’s customers as counterparties. To hedge — or
reduce — the risk from the swap agreements, Evans entered into futures trades on behalf of the
Firm on a futures exchange using the Firm’s central trading account.

17. | Evans was responsible for both discretionary and non-discretionary customer
accounts. A discretionary account is an arrangement by which the owner of the account provides
written power of attorney to someone else, usually the broker, to buy and sell without prior
approval of the account owner. A non-discretionary account is an arrangement by which a
broker must obtain prior approval from the account owner to buy and sell a particular contract.

18. During the relevant period, Evans executed a strategy to hedge fluctuations in
retail gasoline prices on behalf of a discretionary customer (“Customer 1”’).

19. During the spring of 2013, Evans’s discretionary trading strategy became

increasingly unprofitable and resulted in significant losses for Customer 1.

5
Case 4:14-cv-00839-ODS Document 27 Filed 06/16/15 Page 5 of 16
20. | To reduce and/or hide the losses from Customer 1 and bolster his own
compensation, Evans applied reverse mark-ups to transactions for Customer 1 and a customer
with a non-discretionary account (“Customer 2”) and developed a scheme to engage in and
conduct unauthorized trades on behalf of Customer 2.

21. | The unauthorized trades entered into by Evans were bilateral NY MEX RBOB
Euro Swaps, which are swaps where two counterparties agree to exchange payment in the future
based on the change in price of a commodity contract, the NYMEX RBOB Euro Futures
contract.

22. The final price charged by the Firm to its customers for each bilateral energy
swap agreement was based on the price of the underlying futures contract, along with any “mark-
up” or “reverse mark-up.” A “mark-up” is the difference between the price the Firm paid for a
futures contract and the price charged the customer for the corresponding bilateral swap
agreement. Thus, a mark-up results in a profit for the Firm. Conversely, a “reverse mark-up”
represents a better price for the customer for the bilateral swap agreement than the price actually
paid by the Firm for the corresponding futures contract. A reverse mark-up results in a gain to
the customer and a corresponding loss to the Firm.

23. As set forth in the Complaint, from May 23, 2013, to July 19, 2013, Evans
knowingly executed 30 unauthorized trades on behalf of Customer 2 that, after mark-ups and
reverse mark-ups, resulted in approximately $1,213,578.94 in trading losses to Customer 2.

24. Unable to recoup these losses, Evans resigned from the Firm on July 21, 2013.
Subsequently, the Firm compensated Customer 2 in full for the losses incurred as a result of

Evans’s unauthorized trades.

B. Conclusions of Law
(1) Jurisdiction and Venue

25. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that any
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
CFTC may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to
enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order
thereunder. |

26. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred within this
District.

(2) Fraud by Unauthorized Trading in Violation of Sections 4b(a)(2) and 6(c)(1)
of the Act and Regulation 180.1

27. Section 4b(a)(2)(A), (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A), (C) (2012), makes it
unlawful for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any swap,
that is made, or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, any other person, other than on or
subject to the rules of a designated contract market

(A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other
person;

a 6

(C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by
any means whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the
disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in regard to
any act of agency performed, with respect to any order or contract
for or... with the other person][. |

28.

29.

Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(1) (2012), provides, in relevant part:

It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to use or
employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any swap
... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in
contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission
shall promulgate...

Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a) (2014), was promulgated pursuant to

Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and provides, in relevant part:

30.

It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in
connection with any swap ... to intentionally or recklessly:

(1) | Use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, any
manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;

(2) | Make, or attempt to make, any untrue or misleading
statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made not untrue or
misleading;

(3) Engage, or attempt to engage, in any act, practice, or course
of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon any person....

By the conduct described in the foregoing paragraphs, Defendant violated

Sections 4b(a)(2)(A), (C), and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 9(1) (2012), and

Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a) (2014), by knowingly: (i) effecting swap transactions

for Customer 2’s non-discretionary account without obtaining Customer 2’s authorization to

effect those transactions; and (ii) willfully omitting material facts, including but not limited to,

the swap transactions Evans effected, the profits and losses incurred by those transactions, and

the magnitude of the risks to which Evans subjected the customer’s account.

Case 4:14-cv-00839-ODS Document 27 Filed 06/16/15 Page 8 of 16
(3) Fraud in Violation of the External Business Conduct Standards for Swap
Dealers (Regulation 23.410(a)(3))

31. Regulation 23.410(a)(3) makes it unlawful for any swap dealer or major swap
participant to “engage in any act, practice, or course of business that is fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative.” 17 C.F.R. § 23.410(a)(3) (2014).

32. Regulation 23.401(d) defines “swap dealer” for the purposes of the Business
Conduct Standards, see generally 17 C.F.R. pt.23, subpart H (2014), as “any person defined in
Section 1a(49) of the Act and § 1.3 of this chapter and, as appropriate in this subpart, any person
acting for or on behalf of a swap dealer, including an associated person defined in Section 1a(4)
of the Act.” 17 C.F.R. § 23.410(d) (2014). Section 1a(4) of the Act defines an “associated
person of a swap dealer” in relevant part as “a person who is associated with a swap dealer .. . as
... [an] employee, or agent (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar
functions), in any capacity that involves (1) the solicitation or acceptance of swaps.” 7 U.S.C.

§ 1(a)(4)(A) (2012).

33. The Firm provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer effective
December 31, 2012.

34. During the relevant period and in connection with the facts alleged herein,
Defendant acted as an AP of a swap dealer because he engaged in the solicitation or acceptance
of swaps on behalf of the Firm. See 7 U.S.C. § 1a(4)(A) (2012).

35. By the conduct described in the foregoing paragraphs, Defendant violated
Regulation 23.410(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 23.410(a)(3) (2014), by: (i) knowingly effecting swap
transactions with a counter-party, Customer 2, without obtaining its authorization to effect those

transactions; and (ii) willfully omitting material facts, including, but not limited to, the swap

9
Case 4:14-cv-00839-ODS Document 27 Filed 06/16/15 Page 9 of 16
transactions he effected, the profits and losses incurred by those transactions, and the magnitude
of the risks to which he subjected Customer 2’s account.

(4) | Unauthorized Swap Transactions in Violation of Regulation 166.2

36. Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. § 166.2 (2014), makes it unlawful for an AP of an
FCM to effect a transaction in a commodity interest for a customer account unless, before the
transaction: (i) the customer has specifically authorized the AP to effect the transaction by |
specifying the precise commodity interest to be purchased or sold and the exact amount, or (11)
the customer has executed a written authorization (e.g., a “power of attorney”) for the AP to
trade without the customer’s specific authorization.

37. As set forth in Regulation 1.3(yy)(4), 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(yy)(4) (2014), a commodity
interest includes swaps as defined in the Act. Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. § 166.2 (2014),
requires that APs of FCMs effect only those transactions related to commodity interests that have
been specifically authorized.

38. | By the conduct described in the foregoing paragraphs, Defendant violated
Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. § 166.2 (2014), by effecting swap transactions for Customer 2’s
non-discretionary account without obtaining Customer 2’s authorization to effect those
transactions, while registered as an AP of an FCM.

39. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Defendant will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in

similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations.
