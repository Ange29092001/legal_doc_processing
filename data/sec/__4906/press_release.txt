U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 20174 / June 29, 2007

SEC v. Si Chan Wooh, Case No. CV-07-957 ST. (D. Or. filed June 29,
2007)

SEC Settles Charges Against Former Portland Steel Executive for
Anti-Bribery Statute Violations

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a
former executive of Portland, Oregon-based Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.,
for violating the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
("FCPA"). Without admitting or denying the allegations, Si Chan Wooh of
Tacoma, Washington, the former Executive Vice President and head of a
Schnitzer subsidiary, agreed to pay approximately $40,000 in disgorgement,
interest and penalties.

The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portland, Oregon,
alleges that from at least 1999 through 2004, Wooh paid over $200,000 in
cash bribes and other gifts to managers of government-owned steel mills in
China to induce them to purchase scrap metal from Schnitzer. According to
the Commission, Schnitzer realized over $6.2 million in profits from sales to
customers procured through these illicit payments. The Complaint further
alleges that during the same period, Wooh made or authorized similar
payments totaling over $1.7 million to managers of privately owned steel
mills in both China and South Korea.

The Commission's complaint alleges that Wooh violated the anti-bribery
provisions of the FCPA and that he aided and abetted Schnitzer's violations of
the FCPA provisions that require companies to keep accurate books and
records (respectively, Sections 30A and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934). Without admitting or denying the charges, Wooh agreed to
disgorge $14,819.38 in bonuses plus prejudgment interest of $1,312.52, to
pay a $25,000 civil penalty, and to an order enjoining him from violations of
the FCPA in the future.

In October 2006, Schnitzer settled related charges by the Commission by
paying $7.7 million in disgorgement. Schnitzer also paid $7.5 million in
penalties to settle related criminal charges brought by the U.S. Department of
Justice.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in
the Commission's investigation. The Commission's investigation is continuing.
