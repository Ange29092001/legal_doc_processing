COMPLAINT FOR CIVIL PENALTY

The plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the
âCommissionâ files this complaint and alleges the following against
defendant Gioacchino De Chirico (âDe Chiricoâ or âDefendantâ):

SUMMARY

1, This matter relates to a payment made in 2004 by Immucor,
Inc., (âImmucorâ) a manufacturer and distributor of blood analysis
equipment and supplies used by hospitals and blood banks, to a director of a

public hospital in Italy. The payment was made as a quid pro quo for the

SEC 001120 00377
director giving Immucor favorable consideration with regard to a contract to
provide products and services to the hospital.

2.  Immucor, aided and abetted by De Chirico, its President and
Chief Operating Officer, falsely recorded in its books the payment to the
hospital director as a legitimate corporate expense for services rendered in
connection with opportunities in Switzerland. In Italy, hospital directors are
public officials.

3. By disguising the payment to the hospital director as a
legitimate corporate expense for services rendered, Defendant violated
Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ)
and Rule 13b2-1 [15 U.S.C. Â§78m(b)(5) and 17 C.F.R. 240.13b2-1] and
aided and abetted Immucorâs violations of Sections 13 (b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and
78m(b)(2)(B)].

JURISDICTION

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections
21(d) and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ)
[15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d)(3) and 78aa]. Defendant, directly or indirectly, made

use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the mails

SEC 001120 00378
in connection with the acts, transactions, practices and courses of business
alleged in this Complaint.

5. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because a substantial portion of the
conduct alleged in this Complaint occurred within the Northern District of
Georgia. In addition, as alleged in this Complaint, venue in this District is
proper because Defendant resides in the Northern District of Georgia and the
conduct arose out of his employment at Immucor, which at the time
maintained its headquarters in the Northern District of Georgia.

DEFENDANT

6. Gioacchino De Chirico, 53, an Italian citizen and legal resident
of Georgia, was, during the relevant period, President and Chief Operating
Officer of Immucor. De Chirico resides in Dunwoody, Georgia.

RELATED ENTITY

7. Immucor, Inc. is a Georgia corporation headquartered in
Norcross, Georgia. At all relevant times, its stock was registered with the
Commission under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on

the NASDAQ market under the symbol BLUD.

SEC 001120 00379
8.  Immucor is a medical equipment company specializing in the
manufacture and marketing of products used in the pre-transfusion
diagnostics of human blood. Among other things, the company develops,
manufactures, and sells products used by hospital blood banks, clinical
laboratories, and blood donor centers to detect and identify various properties
of human blood prior to patient transfusion. These products include a blood
analysis system, called âGalileo,â and the reagents, strips and other supplies
needed by Galileo to diagnose blood samples.

9. | Immucor does business internationally through several wholly
owned subsidiaries that operate sales and distribution facilities in the
particular countries in which they are located. Immucor Italia S.p.A.
(âImmucor Italiaâ) is Immucorâs subsidiary in Italy.

FACTS

10. Onor about January 8, 2002, Immucor Italia sold blood testing
units of a design that preceded Galileo to Niguarda Hospital in Milan, Italy.
In addition to receiving the sales price for the units, this sale and the
associated contract insured that Immucor would receive a stream of revenue
from Niguarda Hospital for the hospitalâs regular purchases of the reagents,

strips, and other supplies necessary to make the units work. Although the

SEC 001120 00380
units were subsequently replaced by Galileo units, the contract for supplies,
with its related income, remained in place.

11. In May 2003, De Chirico arranged for the director of Niguarda
Hospitalâs blood bank (âthe hospital directorâ) to plan and chair a medical
conference related to Galileo that was held in Italy in October 2003.

De Chirico agreed to compensate the hospital director for his services and
reimburse him for his expenses.

12. Although the amount of the compensation and expenses were
never discussed, the hospital director did request, and De Chirico agreed,
that payment would be made in a manner which would enable the hospital
director to avoid Italian income taxes. Following the conference, however,
the hospital director did not submit to De Chirico any request for
compensation or payment of his expenses and, by February 2004, no
payments to the hospital director relating to the conference had been made.

13. To arrange a payment of â¬13,500 to the hospital director, an
Immucor Italia sales agent submitted a payment request to Immucor
describing the payment as the hospital directorâs overdue compensation for

the October 2003 conference, and asking that it be paid to a Swiss bank

account for the benefit of the hospital director. The payment was a quid pro

SEC 001120 00381
quo for the hospital director favoring Immucor in selecting contracts for
supplies and equipment.

14. In accordance with his earlier agreement with the hospital
directorâs request to assist him in avoiding Italian taxes, De Chirico
authorized that the â¬13,500 payment be made through Immucorâs German
subsidiary, Immucor Medizinische Diagnostik GmbH. In so doing, he
approved an invoice that falsely described the â¬13,500 payment as a
consulting fee for services in connection with Galileo opportunities in
Switzerlandâwork that De Chirico knew the hospital director had never
performed.

15. As aresult of De Chiricoâs actions, Immucor failed to properly
record the disbursement, and, in April 2004, falsely booked the entry as an
expense for consulting services, and filed the related false invoice.

16. Immucor failed to devise and maintain internal accounting
controls which were sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its
accounts were accurately stated in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. Specifically, Immucorâs system of internal

accounting controls was inadequate to prevent or detect these false entries.

SEC 001120 00382
17. Asa further result of De Chiricoâs actions and because
Immucor improperly recorded and paid a false invoice, its books, records
and accounts did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect its
transactions and dispositions of assets.

permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and to maintain accountability for its assets. Through the conduct
described in the above paragraphs, Defendant knowingly and substantially
assisted Immucorâs violations.
