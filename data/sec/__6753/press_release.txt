U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 20316 / September 28, 2007

SEC v. Gioacchino De Chirico, Civil Action File No. 1:07-CV-2367
(N.D.GA)

SEC Files Action Naming Officer of Immucor, Inc., for Violating, and
Aiding and Abetting violations of, Books and Records and Internal
Control Provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange
Act")

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a
settled civil action against Gioacchino De Chirico, Chief Executive Officer of
Immucor, Inc., for violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule
13b2-1, and for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The Commission's complaint, filed in the
United States District Court of the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that in
April 2004, Immucor paid â¬13,500 (Euros) to the director of a public hospital
in Milan, Italy as a quid pro quo for the hospital director favoring Immucor in
selecting contracts for supplies and equipment. The complaint further alleges
that De Chirico approved an invoice that falsely described the â¬13,500
payment as a consulting fee for services in connection with opportunities in
Switzerland â work De Chirico knew the hospital director had never
performed.

With the filing of the Commission's action, De Chirico has agreed, without
admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, to the
entry of a final judgment ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $30,000.
Separately, Immucor and De Chirico consented to a Commission cease-and-
desist order related to the same events, without admitting or denying the
Commission's findings. (Exchange Act Release No. 56558)
