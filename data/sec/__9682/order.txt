COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY |

â1. Innospec Inc. (âInnospecââ) is a manufacturer and distributor of fuel
additives and other specialty chemicals. From 2000 to 2007, Innospec violated the anti-
bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (âFCPAâ) when it routinely paid bribes in order to sell Tetra Ethyl Lead
(âTELâ), a fuel additive, which boosts the octane value of gasoline, to government owned
refineries and oil companies in Iraq and Indonesia. TEL is a sunset product because
worldwide use of TEL has declined since 1973 following the enactment of the Clean Air

Act of 1970 and similar legislation in other countries. Innospec engaged in bribery to

ry M.
maintain its TEL business, which accounted for significant revenue during the relevant
time period.

2. Innospec paid kickbacks to Iraq from 2001 to 2003 in order to obtain
contracts under the United Nations (âUNâ) Oil for Food Program (the âProgramâ). After
the Program ended in early 2003, Innospec paid bribes to Iraqi government officials until
late 2007 in order to secure additional contracts. Innospecâs bribery of government
officials in Indonesia began as early as 2000, and continued until 2005 , when Indonesiaâs -
need for TEL ended. Innospecâs former management did nothing to stop the bribery
activity, and in fact authorized and encouraged it. In addition, Innospecâs internal
controls failed to detect the illicit conduct, which continued for nearly a decade.

3. In all, Innospec made illicit payments of approximately $6,347,588 and
promised an additional $2,870,377 in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries, Iraqi
government officials, and Indonesian government officials in exchange for contracts
worth approximately $176,71 7,341 in revenues and profits of $60,071,613.

4. Innospec violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act by engaging in
widespread bribery of government officials in lrag during the post-Oil for Food period
and government officials in Indonesia in order to sell TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oi!
(âMoOâ) and state owned oil companies in Indonesia. Innospec violated Section
13(>)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to maintain internal controls to detect and
prevent bribery of officials in [raq and Indonesia as well as the illicit Oil for Food
Program kickbacks. Finally, Innospec violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act

by improperly recording all of the illicit payments to Iraq and Indonesia in its accounting

books and records.
JURISDICTION

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(A), 21 (e),
and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78ua(e) and 78aa}. Innospec, directly
or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the
mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

6. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act
{15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

- FACTS
OL Background on The United Nations Oi for Food Program

23. The Oi for Food Program was mitended to provide humanitarian relief for
the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under the international trade sanctions
that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Program permitted the Iraqi
government to sell its crude oil and use the proceeds to purchase food, medicine, and
critical infrastructure supplies. |

24. The proceeds of the oil sales were transferred directly from the buyers to
an escrow account (the âU.N. Escrow Accountâ) maintained in New York by the United
Nations 661 Committee. Funds in the U.N. Escrow Account were available for the
purchase of humanitarian supplies, subject to U.N. approval and supervision... The intent
of this structure was to prevent the proceeds of iraqâs crude oil sales from undermining
the sanctions regime by supplying cash to Saddam Hussein.

25. Corruption was rampant within the Program. By mid-2000 Iraqi
ministries, on the instruction of top government officials, instituted a policy requiring
suppliers of humanitarian poods to pay a ten percent kickback on each contract. This
kickback requirement was euphemistically referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee
(âASSPâ), however, no services were provided. Suppliers competing to obtain contractsâ
under the Program were encouraged to include a ten percent markup in their bids or
purchase orders.

26. The inflated contract prices were incorporated into the Oi! for Food
contracts as a way to permit the suppliers to recover from the U.N. Escrow Account the

kickback payments they had paid secretly to Iraq. Following the 2004 release of a report
by the U.S. General Accounting Office exposing some of the abuses, the ULN..
comunissioned an independent inquiry committee, headed by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker (the âVolcker Committeeâ), to investigate the Programâs
performance. That committeeâs October 27, 2005, final report estimated that the Traqi
government had diverted $1.7 billion in iliicit income from the Program.

EL Tanospecâs Payment of After Sales Service Fees in Connection with the U.N.
OU For Food Program

27. From 2000 through 2003, Innospec participated in the U.N. Oil for Food
Program through its Swiss subsidiary, Alcor. During that period Alcor entered into five
contracts for the sale of TEL to the iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries
(âMoOâ) and paid kickbacks equating 10% of the contract value on three of the contracts.
In all, Innospec paid kickbacks of $1,853,754 and offered additional kickbacks of
$1,985,897 to Iraq, eaming revenues of approximately $45,804,915 on the five Oil for
Food contracts and profits of $23,125,820. |

28. Alcor executed five contracts with Iraqâs MoO and paid kickbacks to three
MoO refineries, Basrah, Daura and Baiji. Alcor used Iraqi Agent to funnel the payments

. to Iraq. On December 14, 2001, Alcor increased lraqi Agentâs standard commission on
three of the program contracts from 2% to 14% to enable him to pay the kickbacks.

29, For each of the three contracts, Alcor artificially inflated its prices in its
bids provided to. the UN by the 10% after sales service fee (âAS SEâ), Alcor did not
notify the UN of the secretly inflated prices or of Alcorâs intent to kickback 10% to Irag.
In order to meet Iraqâs dernand that the kickback be paid prior to the shipment of TEL,
Alcor forwarded the ASSF amount to Iraqi Agentâs bank account in Switzerland thirty

days in advance of shipment.
30. Ina fax to Innospec, Innospecâs agent stated that the contract price
included a â2% + 2%â fee for his company, plus an additional 10% for âThird Party
Reimbursement.â On June 2, 2001, Alcor Manager signed a side agreement on behalf of
Alcor promising to pay Iraq the 10% kickback referred to in iraqi Agentâs fax.
Thereafter Alcor wired the 10% ASSF, plus additional agentâs fees, to Iraqi Agentâs
Swiss account. Innospec entered into additional side agreements with Iraq to pay the
ASSFs.

31. â On the last two Oil for Food contracts, Alcor inflated its bid by 10% to
include an. ASSF. However, due to the subsequent invasion of Iraq by U.S. allied forces,
the kickbacks on the final two contracts were never collected by Iraqi officials and Alcor
incorporated the additional 10% into its profits. The kickback payments on the contracts
were improperly booked as legitimate commission payments.

1. Innospeeâs Post-Oil For Food Bribery Payments in lrag

32. After the Oil for Food Program was terminated in late 2003, Innospec
continued to use Iraqi Agent to pay bribes to Iraqi officials in order to secure TEL
business from Iraq.

33. From at least 2004 throngh 2007, Innospec made payments totaling
approximately $1 61 0,327 and promised an additional $884,480 to MoO officials $0 as to
garner good will with Iraqi authorities, obtain additional orders under a Long Term
Purchase Agreement that was executed in October 2004 (the â2004 LTPAâ) and ensure
the execution of a second LTPA in January 2008 (the â2008 LTPAâ). The total profit

received from the conduct was $15,439,183.
A Innospec Bribed Iraqi Government Officials im Connection with the
2004 LTPA

34, After the Oil for Food Program ended, Alcor entered into a three year
Long Term Purchase Agreement for the sale of TEL to the Iraqi MoO. The 2004 LTPA
was executed in October 2004, and was performed pursuant to six purchase orders dated
February 2005 through December 2007.

35. Under the contract, Alcor sold a total of 5 932 Metric Tons CMTâ) of
TEL at a price of â¬10,500 per MT. Innospecâs revenues from the contract were
$82,340,489, and profits were $15,198,125. |

36. With the approval of management, including Business Director and
Executive B, Iragi Agent continued to make improper payments to Iraqi officials to
facilitate TEL shipments under the 2004 LTPA. In an e-mail dated October 10, 2005,
Iraqi Agent informed Business Director and Executive B that prior to opening a letter of
credit for a 740 MT shipment of TEL, Iraqi officials were demanding a 2% kickback
from Alcor, which equaled $195,912.78. lraqi Agentâs e-mail further stated that: âWe
are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and
we will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to
get the rewards.â |

37. Business Director responded to Iraqi Agentâs e-mail on October 13, 2005,
confirming that the requested kickback would be paid through an additional 2%
âcommissionâ to fraqi Agent. On October 20, 2005, Business Director and Alcor
Manager discussed the wording of the invoice that Iraqi Agent would submit to Alcor to
support the kickback, with Business Director stating that âthe fewer words the better!â

That same day, Business Director e-mailed Iraqi Agent the fictitious language that he
wanted the agent to include in the invoice submitted to Alcor for the $195,912.78
payment.

38. In a similar e-mail dated February 5, 2006, Iraqi Agent informed Business |
Director that Iraqi officials were again demanding a 2% kickback in order to open a letter
of credit for an order of 2000 MT Cater revised to 2200 MT) of TEL under the 2004
LTPA. |

39. Inan e-mail dated February 7, 2006, Executive B approved the kickback
payment, and on February 10, 2006, Business Director wrote fragi Agent to confirm that
Alcor would pay him an additional 2% âcommissionâ in connection with the order. In
. July 2006, Alcor officially increased Iraqi Agentâs commission on the 2004 LTPA from
3% to 5% with the understanding that the additional 2% would be used to pay off Iraqi
officials on future LTPA orders.

40. In all, from October 2005 to 2007, Innospec paid approximately
$1,369,269 in bribes to Iraqi officials in connection with the 2004 LIPA. The payments
were improperly booked as legitimate commission payments.

B. Innospec Bribed Iraqi Government Officials to Ensure the Failure of

a 2006 Trial Test of MIVET and to Facilitate the Execution of a Second
LTPA with rag in 2008

41. In addition to the bribes to facilitate TEL orders on the 2004 LTPA,
Innospec paid Iraqi Agent a total of $155,000 in September 2006 and April 2007, so that
he could ensure the failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured
by a competitor of Innospec and that competed with TEL.

42. Innospec was concemed that ifthe MMT test was successful it would

cause Iraq to purchase substantial amounts of MMT for its oil refineries and lead to a

id
corresponding decrease in demand for TEL in 2008. Accordingly, on September 18,
2006, Business Director approved a payment of $105,000 to Iraqi Agent, purportedly âfor -
additional technical support and security operations required to nurture and protect
ongoing TEL business in iraq.â
| 43, On February 28, 2007, Iraqi Agent sent Business Director a letter |

enclosing the official MoO report for the MMT field trial test and noting his success in
making sure that the MMT test failed âagainst all odds.â Iragi Agent also enclosed a
$50,000 invoice to Innospec, saying that he had been required to pay an extra $50,000 to
ensure that the MMT report came out in fnnospeeâs favor. |

44. On April 3, 2007, Innospec reimbursed tragi Agent for the additional
$50,000 payment. The two payments totaling $155,000 were improperly booked as |
legitimate commission payments. .

45. Aside from paying $155,000 up front to ensure that the MMT test failed,
Iragi Agent, on Alcorâs behalf, also promised additional bribes to Iraqi officials in
connection with future TEL orders. In an e-mail dated March 21, 2007, to Business
Director, Iragi Agent described how he would use his 5% commission from remaining
shipments in 2007 and the new LTPA âto cover my promise to these people for the loss
of their remuneration from MMT, which is a very small price we are paying versus the
loss of my money and your money if MMT were admitted in.â

46. In the end, Alcorâs efforts to sabotage Iraqâs use of MMT were successful
and in January 2008 Alcor executed a second LTPA with the MoO. The agreement took

effect in June 2008 and on February 24, 2009, the MoO opened a letter of credit in favor

il
of Alcor for $17,000,000. Had the agreement zone forward, 5% of the $17,000,000, Le.
- $850,000, would presumably have been shared with Iraqi officials via Alcorâs agent.

47. > The agreement, however, did not go forward. The negotiations leading up
to the agreement were tainted by bribery, and as a result, the 2008 LTPA was not
performed and Innospec did not pay its agent any commissions on the contract.

Cc. âInnospec Paid Travel and Entertainment Expenses for MoO Officials

48. In order to incur good will with the MoO and ensure that it continued to
receive TEL orders, Innospec paid bribes to Iraq by funding lavish trips for Iraqi officials
from 2002 through at least 2006.

49. For example, in 2002 Innospec, through Iraqi Agent, offered to send a
delegation of Iraqi officials to visit Alcorâs offices in Zug, Switzerland at an estimated
cost of $36,500. The trip was to include âSn principle one morming office visit and ithe]
rest, tourism.â

50, In June 2005, Innospec arranged for fragi Agent to pay $22,732 to cover
the costs of a trip by cight Iraqi officials to Innospecâs Ellesmere plant in the UK. The |
2005 trip expenses included hotel accommodations, food and transportation casts, as well
as the provision of approximately $1,800 in âpocket moneyâ for seven of the officials and
approximately $3,600 for the eighth official, who -was head of the iraqi delegation.

31. In another instance, Iraqi Agent submitted an invoice dated March 12,
2006, to Innospec for reimbursement of $13,750 for expenses related toa trip taken by

MoO officials to a 2006 Oil refining conference in Dubai. The invoice covered air fare,

hotel accommodations, and pocket money for three high level government officials and
described the pocket money as âper diem payments as required by the Iraqi Ministry of
Oi.â |
52. Finally, in 2006, Innospec paid $1 3,076 for a trip taken by a MoO official

- to Jordan and then Thailand for a seven day honeymoon. Innospecâs payment covered
hotel accommodations, food, and transportation costs within Thailand. |

33. On January 30, 2008, tragi Agent submitted another invoice to Alcor for
reimbursement of $34,480 for travel costs incurred by Iraqi Mo0 officials who traveled
to Lebanon to finalize the 2008 LTPA with Alcor. Due to the ongoing investigations
being conducted by U.S. regulators, Alcor never paid the invoice, which sought
reimbursement for hotel accommodations, food, mobile phone cards, three cameras and
$15,060 in âpocket moneyâ for officials.

Iv. INNOSPEC PAID BRIBES TO INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT |
OFFICIALS AT STATE OWNED OIL AND GAS COMPANIES

54. Aside from its illicit conduct in Iraq, Innospec also paid bribes to
Indonesian government officials from at least 2000 through 2005 in order to win
contracts for the sale of TEL to state owned oil and gas companies in Indonesia. The
bribes were made through Indonesian Agent and totaled approximately $2,883,507.
Innospecâs revenues in connection with the illicit bribes were approximately $48,571,937
and profits were $21,506,610. |

A. Innospec paid Bribes to an Official at BP Micas in order to Generate
More Tel Sales

5S. From 2000 until approximately 2005, Imospec used Indonesian Agent and

bis company to pay bribes of approximately $1,323,507 to Official X of the Ministry of

13
Energy and Mineral Resources and who later became a senior official at BP Migas, an
Indonesian state owned oi and gas company.

56. The scheme was outlined in an e-mail dated January 8, 2001 from
Managing Director to Business Director stating that m 2000 and 2001 Imnospec agreed to
pay Official X $40 per MT for all TEL orders in excess of 4000 tons and $50 per MT for
all TEL orders in excess of 5,000 tons. Based on the volume of TEL sold to BP Migas,

. Innospec owed Official X $261,055 in 2000 and $294,970 in 2001.

37. "In order to pay the bribes, Indonesian Agent submitted two fictitious
invoices for $265,000 and $295,150 to Innospec, falsely describing the payments as
reimbursements relating to Pertamina/Migas/Lemigas travel and other costs âin the
promotion of Octelâs products, as earlier agreed.â

58.  Pertamima, BP Migas and Lemigas are all Indonesian state owned oil and |
gas companies. On January 9, 2001, Innospec paid the invoice for $265,000, and on
January 8, 2002, it paid the $295,150. Both payments were approved by Managing
Director and in both cases Innospec falsely recorded the bribes, booking the J anuaty
2061 payment as âlegal feesâ and the January 2002 payment as a âsales commission.â |

59. The bribery likely continued until 2005, when Indonesia converted to

unleaded fuel and no longer needed TEL. On June 19, 2001, Managing Director sent
Business Director an e-mail regarding âPertamina pricing 2002 and on,â and recapped the
terms of a new payment arrangement with Indonesian Agent that had recently been
agreed upon with Executive A, saying that the new arrangement would be âcompletely
separate and in addition to.... the [payments to the Official X] fund that is agreed

annually in advance and paid annually in arrears once the required tonnage is achieved.â

14
B.  iInnospec made Improper Payments to an Account at Pictet Bank
in Switzerland in Exchange for TEE Orders from Pertamima

60. In 2000 and 2001, Innospec also made payments to government officials
at Pertamina, another state owned oil company related fo BP Migas. In an undated letter
addressed to Executive C, a company employee said that Octel had âagreed toa special
coramission for TEL salesâ in exchange for obtaining 100% of Pertaminaâs TEL business
from 2000 to 2003. |

61. The letter identified a bank account at Pictet & Cie (âPictetâ) a privately
owned bank in Geneva, Switzerland, which would receive the âspecial commissionâ -
payments. Accordingly, in 2000 Innospec wired a total of $400,000 to the Pictet account
and in 2001 it wired an additional $300,000. Innospec booked the payments as âsales
commissions.â

cy Innospec Paid Bribes to a Government Official at Pertamina in Order
to Sell 446.4 Metric Tons of TEL |

62. In addition to the payments to Official X of BP Migas and to Pertamina
officials through the use of the Pictet account, Business Director and Indonesian Agent
on Innospecâs behalf also bribed other officials at Pertamina in order to influence their
decisions regarding TEL purchases.

63. . For instance, on December 18, 2003, an employee of Indonesian Agent e-
âxnailed Business Director saying that Indonesian Agent had just returned from a meeting
with Official Y of Pertamina and that Official Y had said he would help Octel, but he
wanted more than yast âcentsâ in return.

64. On May 14, 2004, the same employee e-mailed Business Director to say

that Indonesian Agent had been working hard to try and stop Indonesian officials from

i5
switching to unleaded fuel in January 2005, and that Indonesian Agent âmight need some
extra money to support the Lead Defense activitiesâ in Indonesia.

65. In an e-mail dated August 16, 2004, to management, Business Director
said that the entire Board of Pertamina had been replaced and that âthe old position of
[Official Y was] no more.â Business Director added that Official Yâs role would be filled
by Official Z, a senior Pertamina official who was well known to Innospec and was being
checked. |

66. InJ anuary, 2005, Indonesian Agent secured an order on Innospecâs behalf
for 446.4 metric tons of TEL from Pertarnina. In exchange, Innospec, through Business
Director , agreed to a âone off paymentâ of $300,000 to Indonesian Agent with the
understanding that it would be passed on to Official Z at Pertamina.

67. The payment was arranged in two parts. First, Innospec increased
Indonesian Agentâs commission on the order from 6% to 10%, leading to an extra
payment of $184,363.20, which was credited to the agentâs account in Singapore. To
cover the balance, Business Director told Indonesian Agent to submit an invoice for
$115,636.81 to Innospec, and provided the fictitious language that he wanted included in
the invoice to justify the payment.

68. | On February 8, 2005, Indonesian Agent sent Business Director an e-mail
saying that be had opened an account for Official Z and that Official Z had called
requesting his balance payment. On February 14, 2005, Indonesian Agent submitted the
' $115,636.81 invoice to Innospec, and Business Director and Executive B approved it.

On March 18, 2005, Innospec credited the invoice payment to Indonesian Agentâs

16
account in Singapore. Innospec falsely booked the entire $300,000 payment to
Indonesian Agent as âsales commissions.â

69, In order to ensure that Official Z approved the 446.4 MT order, Innospec
also paid for a trip taken by Official Z and his family to the UK in April 2005.
Innospecâs revenues on the sale of 446.4 metric tons of TEL to Pertamina were
$4,796,155 and its profits were $1,898,571. |

v. INNOSPEC COMMITTED ANTI-BRIBERY, INTERNAL CONTROLS,
AND BOOKS AND RECORDS violations

70. Innospec made millions im illicit payments and promised payments, either
directly or indirectly, to Iraqi | government officials during the post-Oil for Food period
and to Indonesian government officials for the purpose of influencing their decisions and
obtaining or retaining business through the sale of TEL. innospec, a U.S. issuer, made
use of U.S. mails and interstate commerce to carry out the scheme, and at least one US.
person and officer was complicit in the scheme.

71.  Inconnection with all of the illicit payments in Iraq, including the Oil forâ
Food payments, as well as the payments in Indonesia, Innospec failed to make and keep
accurate books, records and accounts. Many of the bribes were mischaracterized as
legitimate commissions, travel and legal fees in Innospecâs books and records.

72, Moreover, as evidenced by ihe extent and duration of the improper
payments to foreign officials made by Innospec, the improper. recording of these
payments in Innospecâs books and records, the failure of Innospecâs former management
to detect these irregularities, and the significant involvement of certain members of

rnanagement at the highest levels of the company, Innospec failed to devise and maintain

17
an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect these anti-bribery and books
and records violations.
