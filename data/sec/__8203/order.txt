Oscar H. Meza,

Defendant.

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ) alleges as

follows:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from multiple violations of the anti-bribery provisions of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (âFCPAâ), and other provisions |
of the federal securities laws by Oscar Meza, the former Director of Asia-Pacific Sales
for Faro Technologies, Inc. (âF aroâ). Beginning in 2004, Defendant Meza authorized a
former employee of Faroâs ee Faro Shanghai Co., Ltd. (âFaro-Chinaâ), to make
bribery payments termed âreferral feesâ to anpiovess of Chinese state-owned companies
in order to obtain connate. As a result of the defendant's actions, Faro-China paid a
total of $444,492 in bribes during the period 2004 through 2006, generating
approximately $4.5 million in sales and approximately $1.4 million in net profit.

A Through his conduct, Defendant Meza violated the anti-bribery provisions

of the FCPA which are codified in Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1], and violated the books and records-and internal
control provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-
1 [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(5) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1]. Defendant Meza, pursuant to
Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§78t(e)], aided and abetted Faroâs
violations of anti-bribery provisions of Exchange Act Section 30A, and the books and
records and internal controls provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§-78dd-1, 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m (b)(2)(B)].
JURISDICTION
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Exchange Act
Sections 21(d)(3) and 27 [ 15Â°U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d)(3) and 78aa]. In connection with the
conduct described herein, Defendant made use of the mails and/or the means or
âinstrumentalities of interstate commerce.
DEFENDANT
4. Defendant Meza is a.U.S. citizen currently residing in Quebec, Canada.

Defendant Meza began his employment with Faro in 2000. During the relevant time
period, Meza was first, Vice-President for Asia-Pacific Sales for Faro, and then the
Director of Asia-Pacific Sales. In those positions, Meza was the Faro executive
responsible for managing Faro-Chinaâs sales efforts. Throughout the relevant time
period, Meza received a base salary, plus a sales commission that was based on the value
of all sales contracts awarded to Faro-China, including sales contracts awarded by ,

Chinese government-owned companies.
RELEVANT PARTY

5. Faro is a software development and manufacturing company with its
headquarters located in Lake Mary, Florida. Faroâs common stock is registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is traded on the
NASDAQ. On June 5, 2008, the Commission ordered Faro to cease-and-desist from
committing or causing violations of Exchange Act Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and
13(b)(2)(B), and to pay disgorgement of $1,411,306 plus prejudgment interest of
$439,637.32, in connection with the improper payments made by Faro-China and
authorized by Meza.

FACTS
6. In early 2003, Faro established Faro-China to sell its products in China.
, Previously, Faro relied on a Chinese distributor to sell Faro products to Chinese
customers.

7. Shortly after establishing Faro-China, Faro promoted Meza, then Vice-
President of Sales for the Asia-Pacific region, to the post of Director of Asia-Pacific
Sales. In this capacity, Meza had oversight responsibility for sales at Faro-China, as well
as other Faro subsidiaries and distributors in the region.

8. Subsequently, Meza recommended a former employee of Faroâs Chinese
distributor for the new Country Sales Manager position (âCountry Managerâ) at Faro
China, and in May 2003, Faro offered that individual an employment contract.

9. After receiving the proposed employment contract, the Country Manager
communicated to three Faro officers, including Meza, requesting permission to âdo

business [on behalf of Faro] the Chinese way.â After receiving that request, Meza
explained to the other two Faro. officers that the Country Manager was requesting
permission to pay kickbacks or other things of value to potential customers in order to
obtain sales contracts with those customers.

10. After learning of the Country Managerâs request to do business âthe
Chinese way,â certain Faro officers sought a legal opinion from Faroâs Chinese counsel
as to whether such payments to customers violated Chinese law. Members of Faro
management, including Meza, learned that such payments to customers likely violated
Chinaâs anti-bribery laws, particularly where Faro-Chinaâs customers were Chinese state-
owned companies. ,

11. After receiving this legal advice that noted the prevalence of state-owned
companies in China, the same Faro officers orally directed both Meza and the Country
âManager not to make any such payments.

Meza Authorized the Bribery Scheme

12. Soon after beginning Faro-Chinaâs operations, Meza authorized the
Country Manager to make illegal cash payments, termed âreferral fees,â to employees of
Chinese state-owned companies in order to obtain contracts. For example, in a
November 2004 e-mail to Meza, the Country Manager requested permission to give a
$13,300 payment to an employee of a state-owned company. In the same e-mail, the
Country Manager reiterated that âto have a good relationship with customers in Chinaâ
you have to give them âmoney.â

13. The Country Manager explained that taking customers to dinner or giving
them travel opportunities was not enough to promote a good relationship with the

potential customer in China. Instead, employees of companies, including state-owned
companies, wanted cash in order âto cooperate with [Faro] and help [Faro] get the order.â
Meza responded to the Country Manager by e-mail, saying that he has âalways
understoodâ that this is how axiness was done in China, and approving the improper
payment.

14. Throughout 2004 and 2005, Meza approved additional corrupt payments
to employees of state-owned or state-controlled businesses in China in order to obtain
sales contracts. Meza never instructed the Country Manager to cease the payments.
Instead, Meza merely expressed concern that they would be caught making the payments.
In the same November 2004 e-mail, Meza stated that the 20-30% âreferral feeâ is âa lot
of money in China and someone will notice that one day and we may all be in trouble.â
Meza instructed the Country Manager to âbe carefulâ when making the improper
payments, but to make the improper payments when he âreally needed to do it.â

Meza Instructed Faro-China Staff to Alter Accounts and Conceal the
True Nature of the Improper Payments and Approved the Use of
Third-Party Intermediaries to Avoid Detection

15. To conceal the bribes, Meza instructed Faro-Chinaâs staff to alter account
entries in order to delete the actual recipient of the improper payments. As Director of
Asia-Pacific Sales, Meza was responsible for ensuring that Faro-Chinaâs sales were
accurately described and entered in Faro-Chinaâs books and records. Yet, in an April
2004 e-mail, Meza instructed Faro-China accounting staff: âplease do not use the words

299

âcustomer referral feeâ but only âreferral feeââ when describing the improper payments in
the companyâs books and records.
16. In the same e-mail, Meza explained that the reason for his instruction was

that he âdid not want to end up in jailâ as a result of âthis bribery.â
17. In February 2005, a new Faro officer e-mailed a news article to all
international business units describing the prosecution of another U.S. company for
payment of bribes in China, and stated that the article highlighted the fact that Faro must
take precautions to âobserve U.S. lawâ in their dealings in China.

18. The Faro officer specifically forwarded the e-mail to Meza and instructed
him to have it translated for Faro-Chinaâs staff. After reading the translated e-mail, the
Country Manager e-mailed Meza and requested authorization to continue making the
improper payments, albeit through third-party intermediaries or âdistributors.â

19. In a February 16, 2005 e-mail response, Meza approved the Country
Managerâs proposed use of an intermediary to funnel payments to customers, including
state-owned customers, in order âto avoid exposure.â Faro-China funneled cash
payments through these intermediaries for nearly one year, from early 2005 until early
2006.
