ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or “CFTC”) has reason to
believe that on several days in April and June 2009, Credit Suisse International (“CSI”) violated
Section 4a(b)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6a(b)(2) (2009), and
Commission Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. § 150.2 (2009). The Commission also has reason to
believe that in March 2013, Credit Suisse Securities (USA), LLC (“CSS-USA”) violated Section
6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012). Collectively, CSI and CSS-USA are referred to herein
as “Respondents.” Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order
should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) (2012) of the
Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order’’) and acknowledge service of
this Order.

 

Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any

other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that
Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the
Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in
bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order,
or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
IIL.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

On several days in April and June 2009, CSI exceeded the CFTC all-months speculative
position limit for Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) wheat futures contracts despite having been
granted an increased hedge exemption by the Commission.

Additionally, in March 2013 CSS-USA submitted to the CFTC’s Division of
Enforcement (“DOE”) materially false or misleading information reflecting certain inflated swap
positions and thus inflated hedge exemptions for CBOT wheat futures contracts for CSS-USA,
CSI and other affiliates for several days in April and June 2009.

B. RESPONDENTS

Credit Suisse International is a British company based in London, UK. Credit Suisse
International is provisionally registered with the Commission as a Swap Dealer.

Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is a Delaware corporation with its principal place
of business in New York City. CSS-USA is registered with the Commission as a Futures
Commission Merchant (“FCM”), Commodity Trading Advisor (“CTA”), Commodity Pool
Operator (“CPO”) and Swap Dealer.

Cc. FACTS
1. Position Limits

In 2009, pursuant to CFTC Regulation 150.2, the all-months speculative position limit for
CBOT wheat futures was 6,500 contracts. In September 2008, CSS-USA, on behalf of CSI and
other affiliates (collectively “Credit Suisse”), requested that the Commission grant them an
increase in the hedge exemption for agricultural commodities which were subject to position
limits set forth in Regulation 150.2. CSS-USA requested the increase in order to accommodate
counterparties seeking to unwind over-the-counter (“OTC”) commodity swap positions that they
had opposite certain credit-impaired firms and seeking to reestablish those OTC swap positions
opposite Credit Suisse (“credit migratory swap positions”). The Division of Market Oversight
promptly granted the requested increased exemption from position limits.

On the relevant days, CSI had a hedge exemption which increased its all-months position
limit in CBOT wheat futures contracts. Despite having received this increased hedge exemption,
on several days in April and June 2009 CSI exceeded its increased all-months speculative
position limits for CBOT wheat futures contracts. For example, on April 1, 2009, CSI had an
all-months CBOT wheat futures net long position of 9,831 contracts, which exceeded its
increased position limit by 2,023 contracts.
2. False or Misleading Statements

In March 2013, CSS-USA submitted to the DOE, through counsel, documents purporting
to reflect, among other information, Credit Suisse’s “futures position related to credit migratory
exemption” for the relevant days in April and June 2009. That information in the March 2013
submission differed from the information in contemporaneous submissions made in 2009.
According to the March 2013 submission, CSI’s hedge exemption would have been higher in
April and June 2009 than was warranted by information submitted to the Commission in 2009.
Based on the March 2013 information, CSI would not have exceeded its position limits in April
and June 2009.

However, the information in the March 2013 submission concerning Credit Suisse’s
“futures position related to credit migratory exemption” was materially false or misleading.
While the March 2013 submission purportedly reflected that Credit Suisse had larger credit
migratory swap positions and thus larger hedge exemptions in April and June 2009 than had
previously been reported to the Commission, the submission in fact reflected inflated credit
migratory swap positions and thus inflated hedge exemptions, making them materially false or
misleading.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Violation of Section 4a(b)(2) of the Act and Regulation 150.2

Section 4a(b)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6a(b)(2) (2009), made it unlawful for any person
to “directly or indirectly hold or control a net long or net short position in any commodity for
future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market or derivatives transaction
execution facility or electronic trading facility in excess of any Position limit fixed by the
Commission for or with respect to such commodity...

CFTC Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. § 150.2 (2009), established speculative position limits
in certain futures contracts, including CBOT wheat futures contracts, and stated, in relevant part
“[n]Jo person may hold or control positions, separately or in combination, net long or net short,
for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery or, on a futures-equivalent basis,
options thereon, in excess of the following:” 6,500 all-months position limit for CBOT wheat
futures contracts.

The Commission does not need to establish scienter — i.e., proof of intent to exceed the
applicable speculative position limit — in order to prove a violation of the Commission’s position
limit provisions. CFTC v. Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1218 (7th Cir. 1979); Saberi v. CFTC, 488 F.3d
1207, 1212 (9th Cir. 2007). The Act “unambiguously imposes liability” for violations of
speculative position limits. Saberi, 488 F.3d at 1212 (rejected trader’s contention that DOE was
required to prove that he intended to violate speculative position limits in frozen pork-bellies
futures) (citing Hunt, 591 F.2d at 1218).

On several days in April and June 2009, Respondent CSI held or controlled positions in
excess of the all-months speculative position limit for CBOT wheat futures contracts in violation
of Section 4a(b)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6a(b)(2) (2009), and Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. §
150.2 (2009).

B. Violation of Section 6(c)(2) of the Act
Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012), provides:

It shall be unlawful for any person to make any false or misleading statement of a
material fact to the Commission, including in any registration application or any
report filed with the Commission under this chapter, or any other information
relating to a swap, or a contract of sale of a commodity, in interstate commerce, or
for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, or to omit to
state in any such statement any material fact that is necessary to make any
statement of a material fact made not misleading in any material respect, if the
person knew, or reasonably should have known, the statement to be false or
misleading.

In March 2013, CSS-USA submitted to the DOE materially false or misleading
information reflecting inflated credit migratory swap positions and thus inflated hedge
exemptions for CBOT wheat futures contracts for the relevant days in April and June 2009.
CSS-USA knew or reasonably should have known that this information was false or misleading.
Therefore, Respondent CSS-USA violated Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012).

FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, on several days in April and June
2009, Respondent CSI violated Section 4a(b)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6a(b)(2) (2009), and
Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. § 150.2 (2009), and that in March 2013, Respondent CSS-USA
violated Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2).
