Merrill Lynch Ordered to Pay $300,000 Penalty for Failing to Promptly Produce Audit Trail
Data

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch), a registered futures commission
merchant, for failing to promptly produce to the CFTC certain required records and, separately, failing to supervise its
employees and agents to ensure that they fulfilled the firm’s statutory and regulatory obligations to keep and promptly
produce such records.

The order finds that for nearly three years, Merrill Lynch failed to produce reliable audit trail data requested by the
Division of Enforcement. According to the order, these failures substantially delayed a CFTC investigation and were
attributable in large part to Merrill Lynch’s failure to develop and diligently administer adequate procedures for
responding to routine regulatory requests — for example, Merrill Lynch did not have a process in place to locate account
numbers or order entry operator identification numbers; instead, operations personnel simply worked from memory when
searching for the data.

In addition to imposing a $300,000 civil monetary penalty, the order notes that Merrill Lynch has already taken steps to
revise its internal process for responding to regulatory data requests, including, but not limited to, designating personnel
to: (1) interpret regulatory data requests, the source of the information, and the timing for the response; (2) locate and
provide the data; and (3) independently assess the data extraction process and results.

“As this case shows, the CFTC will hold registrants accountable for their regulatory obligations,” said James McDonald,
director of the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement. “Recordkeeping requirements are important for regulatory and
enforcement purposes, and the failure to produce reliable audit trail data here impeded a CFTC investigation.”

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Amanda Burks, Jordon Grimm, and Rick
Glaser. Additionally, Raagnee Beri and Elizabeth Davis contributed to the case while members of the Division of
Enforcement staff.
