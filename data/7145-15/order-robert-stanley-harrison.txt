UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
ANDERSON DIVISION

U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING
COMMISSION, C/A No. 8:13-cev-00327-JDA
Plaintiff,
v. ORDER OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION
ROBERT STANLEY HARRISON,

Defendant.

 

 

On February 6, 2013, Plaintiff filed its five-count Complaint against Defendant, alleging
violations of anti-fraud and registration provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”)
and CFTC Regulations. (“Complaint,” Dkt. No. 1.) On May 14, 2013, Defendant was indicted
on criminal charges arising from the same fraudulent conduct described in the Complaint. See
United States v. Harrison, 8:13-cr-00354-MGL (D.S.C.). On January 22, 2014, Defendant
pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the indictment, and on September 22, 2014, Defendant was
sentenced to | year and | day in prison and ordered to pay restitution for the same conduct as
described in Plaintiff's Complaint. On December 19, 2014, the Court entered a Consent Order
for Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief. (“Consent
Order,” Dkt. No. #88.) The Consent Order (1) contains findings of fact and conclusions of law
regarding Defendant's misconduct, (2) provides for a permanent injunction prohibiting
Defendant from future violations of the CEA and Regulations, and (3) imposes a civil monetary
penalty against Defendant. The Consent Order also specifically states that Defendant admits the
allegations of the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein. Currently before the

Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Additional Permanent Injunction (“Motion”) against Defendant,
8:13-cv-00327-JDA Date Filed 03/23/15 Entry Number 102 Page 2of5

pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), prohibiting him from further
participation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on
March 23, 2015.

Section 6c(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-I(a) (2012), authorizes District Courts to enjoin
any act or practice constituting a violation of the CEA or Regulations and to enforce compliance
with the CEA and Regulations, Permanent trading, solicitation and registration bans are
appropriate when a defendant's violation of the CEA and/or Regulations poses a threat to the
integrity of the markets regulated by the CFTC. See In re Staryk, [2003-2004 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 29,826, at 56,452 (CFTC July 23, 2004) (explaining that a bar
prohibiting a defendant is appropriate when the record shows that a (defendant’s] misconduct
represents an inherent threat to the integrity of the futures markets in the public eye); Jn r2
Miller, [1994-1996 Transfer Binder] CCH 4 26,440, at 42,914 (CFTC June 16, 1995), remanded
on other grounds, Miller v. CFTC, 197 F.3d 1227 (9th Cir. 1999) (CFTC affirming with “no
difficulty” the trial court’s permanent trading ban because defendant’s pattern of wrongdoing
that extended over several years posed a danger to the integrity of the market sufficient to
warrant a permanent ban).

Because fraud is one of the primary threats to market integrity, many district courts
throughout the Fourth Circuit have imposed permanent bans on market activity in response to the
same types of fraudulent conduct engaged in by Defendant. See e.g., CFTC v. Heffernan, No.
4:04-cv-23302-TLW, Dkt. No. 100 p. 3 (D.S.C. Aug. 31, 2007); CFTC v. PMC Strategy LLC,
993 F. Supp. 2d 368, 380-81 (W.D.N.C. 2012); CFTC v. Smith, No. 1:10CV00009, 2012 WL
1642200, at *12 (W.D. Va. Apr. 16, 2012) (“The egregious, systematic and widespread nature of

[defendant’s} fraudulent conduct warrants imposition of a permanent injunction against him”);
8:13-cv-00327-JDA Date Filed 03/23/15 Entry Number 102 Page 30oi5

CFTC v. Hall, No. 1:11¢ev434, 2013 WL 6145802, at *5 (M.D.N.C. Nov. 21, 2013) (ordering
permanent trading and registration bans in fraud case); CFTC v. McCall Business Grp., LLC, No.
3:08-cv-00445-W, 2010 WL 1665287, at *6 (W.D.N.C. Apr. 23, 2010) (same); CFTC v. Hayes,
No. 4:06cv130, 2007 WL 858772, at *3-4 (E.D. Va. Mar. 13, 2007) (same); CFTC v. Poole, No.
1:05CV00859, 2006 WL 1174286, at *6-7 (M.D.N.C. May 1, 2006) (same). |

As the admissions contained in the Consent Order and Defendant’s guilty plea
demonstrate, Defendant's conduct poses a significant threat to the integrity of the markets
regulated by the CFTC. Defendant admitted to repeatedly committing core violations of the
CEA and Regulations by devising and executing “‘a scheme to defraud and to obtain monies by
means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.” (Consent Order, Dkt.
No. #88, at §. 17.) Additionally, Defendant admitted to accepting funds in his own name and
commingling funds he accepted with his own funds. (Consent Order, Dkt. No. #88, at § 24.)

Upon consideration of Plaintiff's Motion and Defendant's response thereto and for good
cause shown:

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant is permanently restrained, enjoined, and
prohibited from directly or indirectly:

l. Trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is defined
in Section la of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § la (2012));

2. Entering into any transactions involving commodity futures, options on commodity

Sections 2(c)(2)(B) and 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(B) and 2(c)(2)(C)(i) (2012)),

and/or swaps (as that term is defined in Section la(47) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47) (2012), and

as further defined by Regulation 1.3(xxx), 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(xxx) (2014)) for his own personal
account or for any account in which he has a direct or indirect interest;

3. Having any commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity
options, security futures products, forex contracts, and/or swaps traded on his behalf;

on commodity futures, commodity options, security futures products, forex contracts and/or
swaps;

5. Soliciting, receiving or accepting any funds from any person for the purpose of
purchasing or selling any commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity options,
security futures products, forex contracts, and/or swaps;

6. Applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with the CFTC
in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring such registration or exemption from
registration with the CFTC, except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. §
4.14(a)(9) (2014); and

7. Acting as a principal (as that term is defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17 C.F.R.

§ 3.1(a) (2014)), agent or any other officer or employee of any person (as that term is defined in
Section la of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § la (2012)) registered, exempted from registration or required
to be registered with the CFTC except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R.

§ 4.14(a)(9) (2014).

 

"The Court notes that, during the hearing, counsel for Defendant requested that the Court include
a provision in this Order allowing Defendant to seek a lift of the permanent injunction if the facts
and/or circumstances of this case change. The Court declines to include such a provision;
however, if Defendant thinks the facts and/or circumstances change sufficient to warrant a lift of
the permanent injunction, he may file a motion to Jift the injunction at that time.
