CFTC Orders Barclays to Pay $115 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation of and False
Reporting of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

CFIC Also Took Action Today Against Barclays for Abuses of Foreign
Exchange Benchmark Rates

Barclays Has Now Been Subject to Three CFTC Enforcement Actions for
Benchmark Rate Abuses (ISDAFIX, FX, and LIBOR) Imposing a Total of
$715 Million in Penalties and Requiring Extensive Remediation

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an Order today filing and settling
charges against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and Barclays Capital Inc. (collectively, Barclays or the Bank). The
Order finds that, beginning at least as early as January 2007 and continuing through June 2012 (the Relevant Period),
Barclays attempted on many occasions to manipulate and made false reports concerning the U.S. Dollar International
Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a global benchmark for interest rate products. This is the first
enforcement action addressing abuses of this benchmark.

The CFTC Order requires Barclays to pay a $115 million civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations
as charged, and take specified remedial steps, including measures to detect and deter trading intended to manipulate
swap rates such as USD ISDAFIX, to ensure the integrity and reliability of the Bank’s benchmark submissions, and to
improve related internal controls.

“It is often said in CFTC precedent that ‘the methods and techniques of manipulation are limited only by the ingenuity of
man.’ Here, the varied and sophisticated means employed by Barclays traders in their attempts to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX are exposed,” said Aitan Goelman, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement. “As the CFTC has repeatedly shown,
when banks like Barclays try to tip the scales in their favor by attempting to manipulate a benchmark on which their
customers and the markets rely, we will be relentless in investigating and taking action to restore and protect market
integrity.”

Barclays, through its traders, bid, offered, and executed interest rate swap spread transactions in a manner deliberately
designed - in timing, price, and other respects - to influence the published USD ISDAFIX to benefit the Bank in its
derivatives positions, according to the Order. In addition, Barclays, through its employees making the Bank’s USD
ISDAFIX submissions, also attempted to manipulate and made false reports concerning USD ISDAFIX by skewing the
Bank’s submissions in order to benefit the Bank at the expense of its derivatives counterparties and customers.

USD ISDAFIX

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are among the leading benchmarks for interest rate swaps and related derivatives, indicating
the prevailing, daily market rate for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap in various currencies.
USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily (now under a different name and methodology) for various maturities
of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The USD ISDAFIX rate is used for valuing cash settlement of options on interest rate
swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for a wide range of products across financial markets. For example, during
the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was used in settlement of exchange-traded interest rate swap futures contracts and as
a component in the calculation of various proprietary interest rate indices and structured products. Many parties,
including pension funds and local and state governments in the U.S., rely on such instruments based on USD ISDAFIX to
hedge against changes in interest rates.

During the Relevant Period, the USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with
the recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S.-based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm, which
disseminated the rates and spreads captured in this “snapshot” or “print” - as it was referred to by traders and brokers -
to a panel of banks including Barclays. The banks then made submissions to indicate where they would each bid or offer
interest rate swaps to a dealer of good credit.

Barclays’ Unlawful Conduct to Benefit Derivatives Positions

As the Order sets forth, a Barclays interest rate options trader once referred in an email to the risk that “sometimes
isdafix is manipulated.” In fact, as the Order finds, Barclays, through that options trader and others at the Bank, on many
occasions attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX through its trading at the 11:00 a.m. fixing and by skewing its
submissions.
First, Barclays traders bid, offered, and executed transactions in certain interest rate products, primarily swap spreads, at
the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time to affect the reference rates captured in the snapshot sent to submitting banks, and
thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFIX. As captured in emails and audio recordings, when Barclays had derivatives
positions settling or pricing against USD ISDAFIX, its traders discussed their intent to move USD ISDAFIX in whichever
direction benefitted their positions. Barclays traders described the notional amounts they were willing to spend to
influence the USD ISDAFIX as “ammo” or as amounts the traders could “burn,” “waste,” or “use” to “get the print” or
“affect” the “fix.”

Second, Barclays traders also attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by making false USD ISDAFIX submissions. As the
Order finds, Barclays’ submissions were false, misleading, or Knowingly inaccurate because they did not report where
Barclays would itself bid and offer swaps absent a desire to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX, but rather reflected prices that
were more favorable to the Bank on specific positions.

The Order describes numerous examples of each of these strategies for attempted manipulation and false reporting by
Barclays traders during the Relevant Period.

The Order recognizes Barclays’ significant cooperation with the CFTC during the investigation of this matter. The Order
also notes that the civil monetary penalty imposed on Barclays reflects the Bank’s early resolution of this matter.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and the Newark,
New Jersey Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Candice Aloisi, Trevor Kokal, David W.
MacGregor, David C. Newman, Douglas K. Yatter, Lenel Hickson, Jr., Manal M. Sultan, and Gretchen L. Lowe.

The following staff members also assisted in this case: Jordon Grimm, Thomas J. Nolan, Mark A. Picard, Chad E. Silverman,
Judith M. Slowly, K. Brent Tomer, and James G. Wheaton.
