Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (“State of Wisconsin’) (collectively “the
States”), have filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Civil Monetary Penalties, and other
Ancillary Equitable Relief.

Along with the filing of the Complaint, the CFTC and the States moved the Court on an
emergency, ex parte basis, for an order, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange
Act (“CEA”), 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2012), and in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure (“Fed. R. Civ. P.”) 65, that: (1) freezes the assets of Defendants and Relief Defendant,

(2) grants the CFTC and the States immediate access to the books, records, and other documents

of Defendants and Relief Defendant; and (3) appoints a temporary receiver (the “Proposed
SRO”). Plaintiffs request this emergency relief in order to preserve the status quo; to prevent the
dissipation of any assets and ensure that any future equitable relief obtained by Plaintiffs,
including any restitution to the victims of Defendants’ fraudulent scheme, can be effective; and
to determine the full scope of the fraudulent scheme, identify the victims of the scheme, and
locate the remaining assets of Defendants and Relief Defendant. Additionally, Plaintiff requests
expedited discovery in accordance with FRCP 26(d).

The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in
support of the CFTC and the States’ motion, and finds that:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this action
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2018) (federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2018)
(district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by
any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress), as well as 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a)
(supplemental jurisdiction over claims under the laws of the States).
2. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2018)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2018) (district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency expressly
authorized to sue by Act of Congress).
3. Section 6c(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2018), authorizes the CFTC to seek
injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it appears to the CFTC that such person
has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of
any provision of the CEA or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

4. Section 6d(1) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-2(1) (2018), authorizes the States to bring a

ree

suit in the district courts of the United States to seek injunctive and other relief against any
person whenever it appears to the Attorney General and/or Securities Administrator of a State, or
such other official that a State may designate, that the interests of the residents of the State have
been, are being, or may be threatened or adversely affected because of violations of the CEA or
CFTC Regulations.

5. Venue lies properly in this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-
1(e) (2018), because Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain of the acts and
practices in violation of the CEA, the CFTC Regulations, and State laws occurred, are occurring,
or are about to occur within this District, among other places. Venue also lies properly in this
District pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events or omissions
giving rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District.

6. The CFTC and the States have made a proper prima facie showing that from at least
September 1, 2017 through the present (“Relevant Period”), Defendants TMTE, Inc., d/b/a
Metals.com, Chase Metals, LLC, Chase Metals, Inc., (collectively “Metals”), Barrick Capital,
Inc. (“Barrick”) and their principals, Lucas Asher a/k/a Lucas Thomas Erb a/k/a Luke Asher
(“Asher”), and Simon Batashvili (“Batashvili”) (collectively “Defendants”) have engaged and
continue to engage in a fraudulent scheme to defraud at least 1,600 persons throughout the
United States into purchasing gold and silver bullion (“Precious Metals Bullion”). Metals and
Barrick are a common enterprise. Batashvili and Asher were controlling persons of Metals and
Barrick and used both Metals and Barrick to perpetuate the fraudulent scheme. Defendants
targeted a vulnerable population of mostly elderly or retirement-aged persons with little
experience in Precious Metals Bullion. By making material misrepresentations and omissions,

Defendants deceived investors into purchasing Precious Metals Bullion at prices averaging from
SONOMA OG GbeN OE RE an
ODN E & AE AL IMs
Naat Hae SR a

Leos Ga. cer Se

re
Sead

100% to over 200% over the base melt value or spot price of the Precious Metals Bullion
(“Prevailing Market Price”). Defendants directed investors to purchase specific Precious Metals
Bullion at grossly inflated prices that bore no relationship to the Prevailing Market Price.
Defendants did not disclose the actual value of the Fraudulently Priced Precious Metals Bullion
and instead provided investors with invoices showing exorbitant and unreasonable prices.
Defendants falsely represented that Fraudulently Priced Precious Metals Bullion were a safe and
conservative investment and that investors would not lose their funds. Contrary to these
representations, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that the undisclosed, excessive, and
unreasonable charges of Fraudulently Priced Precious Metals Bullion resulted in investors
sustaining substantial losses on the purchase of Precious Metals Bullion from Defendants.

7. Therefore, there is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, are engaging
in, or are about to engage in a scheme to defraud investors in violation of Section 6(c) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 9(1) (2018), Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a)(1)-(3) (2019) and the
laws of the States. Defendants also have engaged in, are engaging in, or are about the engage in
violations of the laws of Plaintiffs State of Alabama, State of Alaska, State of California, State of
Colorado, State of Florida, State of Georgia, Commonwealth of Kentucky, State of Maryland,
State of South Carolina, and State of Texas as specifically alleged in the Complaint.

8. There is also good cause to believe that Relief Defendant Tower Equity, LLC, (“Tower”)
has received, is receiving, or is about to receive funds, assets or other property as a result of
Defendants’ violative acts and practices and has been unjustifiably enriched thereby. The Relief
Defendant does not have any legitimate interest or entitlement to these funds, assets or other
property (“assets”) received as a result of Defendants’ violative conduct.

9. There is also good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the Court’s
PN no en TE TET a

wt TRI wd PO AAS

ability to grant effective final relief for investors in the Fraudulently Priced Precious Metals
Bullion in the form of monetary redress will occur from the withdrawal, transfer, removal,
dissipation, or other disposition of assets, and/or the destruction, alteration, or disposition of
books and records and other documents pertaining to the business activities and business and
personal finances by Defendants and Relief Defendant, unless Defendants and Relief Defendant
are immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

10. Therefore, there is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled, managed
or held by Defendants and Relief Defendant, or in which they have any beneficial interest.

11. There is also good cause for the Court to prohibit Defendants and Relief Defendant from
destroying, altering or disposing of records, and/or denying representatives of the CFTC and the
States access to inspect records, when and as requested, to ensure that CFTC and State
representatives have immediate and complete access to those records.

12. There is also good cause for the appointment of a Temporary Receiver to take control of
all assets owned, controlled, managed, or held by Defendants and Relief Defendant or in which
they have any beneficial interest (“Defendants’ Assets” and “Relief Defendants’ Assets”), so that
the Temporary Receiver may preserve assets, investigate and determine investor claims,
determine unlawful proceeds retained by Defendants and Relief Defendant and amounts due to
investors as aresult of Defendants’ alleged violations, and distribute funds to investors harmed
by Defendants’ alleged misconduct under the Court’s supervision.

13. There is also good cause to order Defendants to repatriate funds, assets or other property
controlled by Defendants so that such assets can be controlled by the Temporary Receiver and to
assure payment of restitution and disgorgement as authorized by the Court.

14. In summary, this is a proper case for granting a restraining order ex parte: (1) prohibiting
Defendants and Relief Defendant from transferring, removing, dissipating assets, or otherwise
disposing of any asset, (2) allowing inspection and copying of records by the CFTC and States,
and (3) appointing a temporary receiver because the CFTC and the States are likely to succeed
on the merits of their claims against Defendants. Moreover, there is reasonable likelihood that
Defendant(s) may transfer or dissipate assets or destroy or alter records. Therefore, the Court
orders the following.

Sections IV, V, and VI of this Order, or as otherwise ordered by the Court;

20. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section I, at the request of the Temporary

Defendants and Relief Defendant, including, but not limited to, both hard-copy documents and

25. | When inspecting records that are subject to this Order, including those contained on

measures to prevent review of the Defendants’ or Relief Defendant’s privileged communications
and/or other nonbusiness, nonfinancial materials by the CFTC’s and the States’ attorneys and

nonbusiness, nonfinancial materials to the CFTC’s or the States’ attorneys and other staff who
are part of the litigation team in this matter. However, nothing herein shall excuse Defendants or
Relief Defendant from full and immediate compliance with this Court’s Order permitting the

of any Defendants or Relief Defendant at any time since September 1, 2017, shall not, in active
concert or participation with Defendants or Relief Defendant, deny a request by the CFTC or the
States to inspect all records pertaining to any account or asset owned, controlled, managed, or
held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants or Relief Defendant, including, but not
