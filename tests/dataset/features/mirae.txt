ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission’’) has reason to believe that
from December 2014 to April 2016 (‘Relevant Period”), Daewoo Securities Co. Ltd. (“Daewoo
Securities”), subsequently acquired by Mirae Asset Securities (now known as Mirae Asset
Daewoo Co., Ltd.) (“Respondent” or “Mirae’’) after the Relevant Period, violated
Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Daewoo
Securities engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should
be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Mirae has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept. Without
admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Mirae consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity Exchange
Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), and acknowledges service
of this Order.’

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Daewoo Securities, which Mirae later acquired, by and
through one of its traders (“Trader A”), engaged in the disruptive trading practice of “spoofing”
(i.e., bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) in the E-mini
S&P 500 Index futures contract (the “E-Mini”) traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(“CME”), a designated contract market owned and operated by CME Group Inc. The disruptive
trading violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).

In accepting the Offer, the Commission recognizes Mirae’s cooperation during the
Division of Enforcement’s (“Division”) investigation of this matter. The Commission
specifically notes that Mirae’s cooperation is being recognized in the form of a reduced civil
monetary penalty.

B. RESPONDENT

Mirae Asset Daewoo Co., Ltd., formerly known as Mirae Asset Securities Co. Ltd.,
which acquired Daewoo Securities after the Relevant Period, is a brokerage and investment
banking firm in the Republic of Korea (“Korea”). During the Relevant Period, Daewoo
Securities engaged in proprietary futures contract trading in the United States through traders,
including Trader A, in its Seoul office.

OF FACTS
1, Daewoo Securities’ Spoofing

During the Relevant Period, Daewoo Securities employed Trader A in Seoul, Korea.
Trader A’s duties included placing orders for futures contracts, including the E-Mini contract, on
the CME. During the Relevant Period, on behalf of Daewoo Securities and within the scope of
his employment at Daewoo Securities, Trader A placed numerous orders for the E-Mini contract
with the intent to cancel those orders before execution.

One strategy Trader A employed involved three steps. First, Trader A entered one or
more disproportionally large orders—that he intended to cancel—on one side of the market (the
“Spoof Order”). Trader A placed the Spoof Orders with the intention of giving a misleading
impression of market depth and inducing other market participants to trade opposite the orders.
Second, capitalizing on the increased buying or selling interest that the Spoof Orders created,
Trader A placed a small order—that he intended to execute—on the opposite side of the market
(the “Genuine Order’). Third, within seconds of the Genuine Order being filled, Trader A
cancelled the Spoof Order before it was filled.
2. Mirae’s Cooperation

Immediately upon learning of the Division’s investigation into conduct engaged in by an
employee of Daewoo Securities, which Mirae had acquired, Mirae began cooperating with the
Division’s investigation. As part of that cooperation, Mirae voluntarily produced documents and
provided important information and analysis at the Division’s request. In addition, Mirae hired
U.S. counsel to conduct an internal review, which included reviewing documents and
interviewing and meeting with more than a dozen Mirae Representatives in Seoul. Also as part
of its review, Mirae hired an expert to analyze Trader A’s trading activity. Mirae completed its
investigation and data analysis in a timely fashion, which expedited the completion of the
Division’s investigation.

Due to Mirae’s cooperation, the civil monetary penalty imposed by the Commission has
been reduced from the otherwise applicable penalty.

IU. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Spoofing in Violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act

Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012), makes it unlawful for
“Ta|ny person to engage in any trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a
registered entity that .. . is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as,
‘spoofing’ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).” See
also United States v. Coscia, 866 F3d 782, 792-93 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding that because the Act
clearly defines spoofing, it provides adequate notice of prohibited conduct), cert denied, 138 S.
Ct. 1989 (2018). As described above, Daewoo Securities, by and through Trader A, entered bids
or offers on a registered entity with the intent to cancel the bids or offers before execution in
violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.

B. Mirae Is Vicariously Liable for the Acts of Daewoo Securities, Which It Acquired
After the Relevant Period

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation
(“Regulation”) 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2019), provide that the act, omission, or failure of any
official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or
trust within the scope of his or her employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or
failure of such individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust. Principals are strictly
liable for the actions of their agents under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2. See
Dohmen-Ramirez v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988); Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC,
802 F.2d 963, 966-67 (7th Cir. 1986); CFTC v. Byrnes, 58 F. Supp. 3d 319, 324 (S.D.N.Y.
2014).

Trader A engaged in the conduct described herein within the scope of his employment
with Daewoo Securities, which was subsequently acquired by Mirae; therefore, pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2, Mirae, as successor to Daewoo Securities, is
liable for Trader A’s acts, omissions, and failures in violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.
