Lo. CIVIL ACTION NO: 18-cv-00603

Plaintiff,
‘ Hon.
JAMES VORLEY and CEDRIC CHANU,

Defendants, JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

 

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY
PENALTIES AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. Beginning in at least May 2008 and continuing through at least July 2013 (the
‘Relevant Period’), Defendants James Vorley (“Vorley”) and Cedric Chanu (“Chanu’’) engaged
in a manipulative and deceptive scheme (the “Scheme’’) while placing orders and trading in the
precious metals futures markets on a registered entity. Specifically, in furtherance of the
Scheme, Vorley and Chanu repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices
by “spoofing” (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).
On numerous occasions, Vorley and/or Chanu placed orders for COMEX gold, silver, platinum
or palladium futures contracts that they wanted to get filled (the “Genuine Order’) and entered
orders for the same contract on the opposite side of the market that they intended to cancel

before execution (the “Spoof Order’). In placing these Spoof Orders, Defendants Vorley and
Chanu intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or demand to trick market
participants into executing against the orders Vorley and Chanu wanted to get filled.

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately July 2011
through at least July 2013, Defendants Vorley and Chanu engaged in acts and practices that
violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C)
(2012).

3. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately August
2011 through at least July 2013, Defendants Vorley and Chanu engaged in acts and practices that
violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(1) (2012) and Commission Regulation
(“Regulation”) 180.1(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2017).

4. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1
(2012), to enjoin Vorley’s and Chanu’s violative acts and practices and to compel Vorley’s and
Chanu’s compliance with the Act. In addition, Plaintiff seeks civil monetary penalties and such
other equitable relief, including but not limited to disgorgement, as this Court deems necessary
and appropriate.

If. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal
question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345, which provides that district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency expressly
authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2012),
authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear
to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or
practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order

thereunder.
Case: 1:18-cv-00603 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/26/18 Page 3 of 19 PagelD #:3

6. Venue properly lies with this Court, pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Vorley and Chanu transacted business in this District, or the acts and
practices in violation of the Act have occurred within this District. Venue is also proper pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(3).

Hil. PARTIES

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal

IV. FACTS
A. Market Fundamentals
10. A Futures Contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery

or cash settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures contract traded on an exchange has

standard, non-negotiable contract specifications.
a a
. nN rder, in the context of electronic excnange trading, 1s a request submitte

to an exchange to buy (that is, “bid’’) or sell (that is, “offer” or “ask’’) a certain number of a
specified futures contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called
“lots,” among other things. Orders are entered into the exchange’s Order Book. When one or
more contracts in an order are bought or sold, that is a “fill” (or a “trade” or “execution’). At
any time before the order is fully filled, the trader can “cancel” the order. When an order is
cancelled, the contracts that have not yet been bought or sold are pulled from the Order Book.

12. An “Iceberg Order” is a type of order that traders could place on an exchange. In
an Iceberg Order, the total amount of the order was divided into a visible portion of a certain pre-
set quantity that was visible to other market participants, and a portion of the order, 1.e. the
remainder of the order, that was not. Whenever the visible portion of the order was filled, the
same, pre-set quantity of the remaining, hidden portion automatically became visible; this
process repeated until the entire order was either executed or cancelled.

13. When a “buy” or “sell” order is submitted to an exchange’s electronic trading
system, the order becomes part of the Order Book. In the Order Book, each trader can view the
aggregate number of contracts that all traders are actively bidding or offering at a given price
level. The best-bid level, or first-bid level, is the highest price at which someone is willing to
buy. The best-ask level, or first-ask level, is the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell.
The bid-ask spread is the difference between those two prices.

14. Traders can view the aggregate contracts and orders up to the tenth-bid and tenth-
ask levels. This combined bid and ask information is often referred to as the visible order book
and represents the visible market depth. Traders often rely on information in the order book to

make trading decisions.
15. Order Book Balance refers to the numeric relationship between the number of
pending visible contracts offered and the number of pending visible contracts bid. Many market
participants rely on the information contained in the Order Book and consider it when making
trading decisions. For instance, if the aggregate size and number of sell orders significantly
outweighs the total aggregate size and number of buy orders, market participants may believe
that the Order Book Balance indicates that supply is exceeding demand and a price drop is
imminent. Accordingly, they may decide to place orders to sell.

16. Commodity Exchange, Inc. (““COMEX”’) is a futures exchange located in New
York, New York. COMEX is a designated contract market for trading futures and options under
the Act. COMEX is owned and operated by CME Group, Inc. (“CME Group’), which is
financial and commodity derivatives exchange based in Chicago, Illinois. CME Group’s
COMEX lists for trading gold futures, silver futures and other precious metals contracts.

17. | New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”’’) is a futures exchange located in
New York, New York. NYMEX is a designated contract market for trading futures and options
under the Act. NYMEX is owned and operated by CME Group. NYMEX lists for trading in
platinum futures, palladium futures and other precious metals contracts.

18. Globex is CME’s electronic trading system, located in the Northern District of
Illinois.

19. COMEX Gold Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during the
current calendar month, the next two calendar months, any February, April, August, and October
falling within a 23-month period, and any June and December falling within a 72-month period
beginning with the current month. One contract unit is equal to 100 troy ounces. The COMEX

Gold Contract is generally referred to herein as “Gold Futures.”

20. COMEX Silver Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during the
current calendar month, the next two calendar months, any January, March, May, and September
falling within a 23-month period, and any July and December falling within a 60-month period
beginning with the current month. One contract unit is equal to 5,000 troy ounces. The COMEX
Silver Contract is generally referred to herein as “Silver Futures.”

21. NYMEX Platinum Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during
the current calendar month, the next two calendar months, and any March, June, September, and
December within a 15-month period beginning with the current month. One contract unit is
equal to 50 troy ounces. The NYMEX Platinum Contract is generally referred to herein as
“Platinum Futures.”

22. NYMEX Palladium Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during
the current calendar month, the next two calendar months, and any March, June, September, and
December falling within a 15-month period beginning with the current month. One contract unit
is equal to 100 troy ounces. The NYMEX Palladium Contract is generally referred to herein as
‘Palladium Futures.”

23. Tick refers to the minimum price fluctuation for a particular futures contract. The
minimum price fluctuation for Gold Futures is $.10 per troy ounce. The minimum price
fluctuation for Silver Futures is $.005 per troy ounce.

24. Globex’s matching algorithm applies a First-In-First-Out (“FIFO”’) principle to
orders at the same level of the Order Book. For example, if there are multiple orders sitting at
the level of the best bid, and an offer is then placed at that same level, the bids will be filled in
the order that they were placed. Modifications to price or quantity will move the order to the

back of the queue.

B. Vorley And Chanu Engaged In A Manipulative And Deceptive Scheme By Spoofing,
And Taught A Subordinate How To Spoof

25. During the Relevant Period, Bank A, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates,
was one of the largest global banking and financial services companies in the world. Bank A had
operations in the United States and around the world. Bank A operated a global commodities
trading business that included the trading of precious metals futures contracts. Bank A’s primary
precious metals futures trading desks were located in Singapore, London and New York.

26. During the Relevant Period, Vorley and Chanu engaged in the Scheme, which
followed the general pattern set forth herein. Vorley and Chanu, both individually and in
coordination with each other and other traders at Bank A, manually placed Spoof Orders for
precious metals futures contracts with the CME through Globex, which they intended to cancel
before execution, opposite Genuine Orders for precious metals futures contracts, which they
desired to execute. Typically, the Genuine Orders were Iceberg Orders and the Spoof Orders
were not. For example, Vorley and Chanu would enter Genuine Orders as Iceberg Orders with
small quantities visible to the market, and within a short time thereafter, placed visibly larger
Spoof Orders on the other side of the Order Book. Vorley’s and Chanu’s Spoof Orders were
often placed within 5 ticks behind the best price so as to reduce the likelihood of them being
filled. The Spoof Orders also were typically at least 10 lots, and were often placed and cancelled
within a 5 second window.

27. Vorley and Chanu intended to cancel the Spoof Orders before execution, and
often did so after their Genuine Orders were filled.

28. Vorley and Chanu’s Scheme involved sending false signals to the market that they
wanted to buy or sell the number of contracts in their Spoof Orders. In reality, Vorley and

Chanu did not want their Spoof Orders to execute; rather, at the time they placed the Spoof

Orders, Vorley and Chanu intended to cancel them before execution. Vorley and Chanu used the
Spoof Orders as a means of tricking other market participants into executing against their
Genuine Orders.

29. Vorley and Chanu’s Scheme was designed to benefit financially from market
participants’ reactions to their Spoof Orders. The following is a simplified explanation of how
their Scheme was intended to work, using a hypothetical example of a Spoof Order on the buy
side. A large Spoof Order to buy would result in an increase in demand in the order book (i.e.,
create or add to an order book imbalance in which orders to buy outweigh orders to sell). This
increase would be visible to other market participants and may lead them to conclude that the
price is likely to rise. This conclusion, in turn, would impact market participants’ decisions,
including prompting some to attempt to purchase contracts before the predicted rise in price
happens. In such a case, these participants would place aggressive orders to buy (.e., at a higher
price than the currently resting bids in the market), making execution of orders resting on the
opposite side of the Spoof Order more likely. Finally, these bids would enable orders on the
opposite side of the Spoof Order—including Vorley and Chanu’s Genuine Orders—to sell
sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would.

30. By engaging in the Scheme as described herein, Vorley entered Spoof Orders to
intentionally send a false signal to the market that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of
contracts specified in the Spoof Orders, or did so while recklessly disregarding the fact that
entering his Spoof Orders would send such a false signal—a signal that injected false
information about supply and demand into the market that could affect market activity. Vorley
engaged in this Scheme to trick other market participants into executing against his or his

colleagues’ Genuine Orders on the opposite side of the market—allowing them to fill sooner, at a

better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would. Vorley knew or recklessly
disregarded that the Spoof Orders would create the false appearance of market depth and result
in misinformation, thereby luring market participants to trade based on Vorley’s spoofing. The
risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead other market participants into believing there was
genuine interest in purchasing or selling the specified number of contracts represented by
Vorley’s Spoof Orders was so obvious that Vorley must have been aware of it. He knew that his
Spoof Orders would appear in the Order Book and that traders often consider order-book
information in making trading decisions; thus, Vorley was, at least, reckless with respect to the
danger that his Spoof Orders would mislead other market participants.

31. By engaging in the Scheme as described herein, Chanu entered Spoof Orders to
intentionally send a false signal to the market that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of
contracts specified in the Spoof Orders, or did so while recklessly disregarding the fact that
entering his Spoof Orders would send such a false signal—a signal that injected false
information about supply and demand into the market that could affect market activity. Chanu
engaged in this Scheme to trick other market participants into executing against his or his
colleagues’ Genuine Orders on the opposite side of the market—allowing them to fill sooner, at a
better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would. Chanu knew or recklessly
disregarded that the Spoof Orders would create the false appearance of market depth and result
in misinformation, thereby luring market participants to trade based on Chanu’s spoofing. The
risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead other market participants into believing there was
genuine interest in purchasing or selling the specified number of contracts represented by
Chanu’s Spoof Orders was so obvious that Chanu must have been aware of it. He knew that his

Spoof Orders would appear in the Order Book and that traders often consider order-book
Case: 1:18-cv-00603 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/26/18 Page 10 of 19 PagelD #:10

information in making trading decisions; thus, Chanu was, at least, reckless with respect to the
danger that his Spoof Orders would mislead other market participants.

32. In or about July 2009, Bank A hired Trader A onto Bank A’s precious metals
trading desk in Singapore. Trader A remained a trader on the desk until approximately February
2012. Over his several months on the desk, Trader A observed Vorley and Chanu’s trading.’
Specifically, Trader A observed Vorley and Chanu spoof. According to Trader A, the trading
patterns described above in paragraph 26 were consistent with spoofing.

33. Trader A explained the Scheme in an electronic chat with Trader B, a trader at
another financial institution, Bank B, on March 28, 2011. At approximately 10:54 p.m. Trader
A said: “basically 1 sold out... just by having fake bids . . . [in] the futures . . . 1 just spam bids
below ...to clear my offer.” The “fake bids” and “spam bids” that Trader A referred to were
Spoof Orders. Shortly before making those statements, Trader A placed a Genuine Order as an
Iceberg Order to sell at 10:43:34 p.m. in Silver Futures for 20 lots, with | lot as the visible
quantity. After that order failed to continue filling for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, Trader A began
quickly placing and cancelling a series of 21 Spoof Orders to buy for a total of 220 lots in order
to get his sell order filled. The Spoof Orders were typically cancelled within | or 2 seconds. At
10:54:12 p.m. Trader A filled the 20" contract of his original sell order and cancelled the
remaining Spoof Orders.

34. During the period that Vorley and Chanu were teaching Trader A how to spoof,
Vorley and Chanu frequently spoofed. For example, on March 16, 2011, Vorley wrote to

another trader at Bank A that he was “spoofing it up... ahem ahem.” On that day, Vorley was

 

1 The bank’s trading technology enabled traders on the precious metals desk to see each other’s
trading activity in real time across all three desk locations.
2 Unless otherwise noted, times referenced are in the Central time zone.

10
attempting to fill a 56-lot Genuine Order as an Iceberg Order to sell with | lot showing in Gold
Futures. Immediately after placing the 56-lot sell order at 6:03:21 a.m., Vorley placed 12 buy
Spoof Orders over the following 5 seconds each for 10 lots, for a total of 120 lots that were
subsequently cancelled within | to 2 seconds each. The Genuine Order continued to fill during
and after the cancellation of the Spoof Orders.

35. In addition to placing Spoof Orders to get their own Genuine Orders filled, as part
of their Scheme, Vorley and Chanu also placed Spoof Orders to help fill Genuine Orders placed
by each other as well as by other traders at Bank A, including Trader A. At other times, Trader
A would place Spoof Orders to help Vorley, Chanu or other traders at Bank A get their Genuine
Orders filled. This frequently happened when one of the traders would notice that a colleague’s
Genuine Order had “stalled,” 1.e., failed to fully fill shortly after being placed. When that
happened, Vorley, Chanu, Trader A or other traders on the desk would “help” their colleague by
placing Spoof Orders opposite the stalled Genuine Order to create the false appearance of market
depth and book pressure and result in misinformation designed to induce a market participant to
fill the Genuine Order when that market participant otherwise might not have done so.

36. Chanu discussed the Scheme with another trader on the desk at Bank A, Trader C,
in an electronic chat dated January 28, 2009. Shortly after Trader C placed Spoof Orders to help
Chanu attempt to fill his Genuine Order, Trader C said to Chanu “so glad i could help... got
that up 2 bucks .. . hahahahah.” He continued: “that does show u how easy it is to manipulate
so[me]times.”” Chanu replied “yeah yeah of course.” Trader C continued: “that was alot of
clicking,” referring to the process of placing a series of Spoof Orders and quickly cancelling
them. Chanu replied: “basically you tricked alkll [sic] the algorythm,” referring to the fact that

Trader C’s Spoof Orders had sent a false signal to the market and deceived other market

11
participants into transacting based on the false information, thereby allowing Chanu to obtain a
favorable execution of the Genuine Order. Trader C stated “1 know how to ‘game’ this stuff”
and Chanu replied “THAT IS BRILLIANT.” Trader C continued: “[I] f..k the mkt around a lot
... not alot of people had it figgied out . . . that[’]s why 1 love electronic trading.”

37. In another example, on November 3, 2010, Trader A was attempting to sell 400
Gold Futures contracts but was not getting all of his Genuine Order (placed as an Iceberg Order)
filled, even after dropping the price. Seeing that Trader A needed a fill, Vorley and Chanu
placed a series of Spoof Orders to buy that they then cancelled after approximately two seconds
each, in an effort to help Trader A fill his Genuine Order. Specifically, Vorley submitted and
cancelled 29 buy orders at 10 contracts each. Following this activity, Trader A writes in an
electronic chat to Vorley “classic jam it... tricks from the master.”

38. Vorley, Chanu and the other traders on the desk continued their Scheme into
2012. For example, on January 6, 2012 at 1:59:04.221, Trader A placed a 20 lot, Gold Futures
Genuine Order to sell as an Iceberg Order with 1 lot visible to the market. The Genuine Order
executed 13 lots after approximately 6 seconds, but then stalled. After stalling for approximately
8 seconds, Chanu placed 9 Spoof Orders to buy starting at 1:59:18.668, 8 for 10 lots and one for
50 lots, for a total of 130 lots. Chanu cancelled all of these orders in less than 5 seconds. One
second after Chanu finished cancelling all of his Spoof Orders, Trader A received a 1-lot fill on
his Genuine Order.

39. On June 6, 2012 at 1:26:57.520, Vorley placed a 30 lot, Gold Futures Genuine
Order to sell as an Iceberg Order with 1 lot visible to the market. The order immediately
executed 20 lots, however, it stalled for almost 12 seconds. Chanu then placed 8 Spoof Orders to

buy, 10 lots each, for a total of 80 lots starting at 1:27:09.320 in order to spoof the market.

12
Case: 1:18-cv-00603 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/26/18 Page 13 of 19 PagelD #:13

While most of the Spoof Orders were pending, 8 additional lots of Vorley’s Genuine Offer
executed. Chanu placed and cancelled each of the Spoof Orders within 5 seconds. Shortly after
Chanu finished cancelling his Spoof Orders, Vorley’s remaining 2 lots of his Genuine Order
executed so that he was fully filled.

C. Vorley And Chanu Continued Their Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme Through
2013

I. January 28, 2013 Spoofing

AO. Vorley and Chanu continued their Scheme into 2013. For example, on January
28, 2013, at approximately 15:32:43.198, Vorley placed a 34-lot Genuine Order as an Iceberg
Order to show 1 lot to the market, to buy Gold Futures at $1655.20.

Al. After approximately 30 seconds during which the Genuine Order did not fill, at
15:33:12.415, Vorley placed a 110-lot Spoof Order, to sell Gold Futures at $1655.70 that he
intended to cancel before execution. The 110-lot order was placed 3 ticks away from the best
offer at the time of placement.

42. Before the Spoof Order was placed, the market was relatively balanced, with 13%
more offers than bids. As a result of the Spoof Order, the market became one where there were
96% more offers than bids.

43. Approximately | second after the Spoof Order to sell was placed, the Genuine
Order to buy begins to fill rapidly, | lot at a time, until all 34 lots fill over the course of a few
milliseconds.

44. Approximately 1.6 seconds after the last lot of the Genuine Order filled, Vorley
cancelled the 110-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety. That Spoof Order was on the market for

an overall time of just under 3 seconds.

45. On May 23, 2013, at 1:05:45.122, Chanu placed a 96-lot Genuine Order that was
an Iceberg Order showing 1 lot to the market to buy June delivery Gold Futures at $1374.10. At
the time, $1374.10 was 5 ticks off of the best bid in the market.

46. The Genuine Order continued to sit unfilled and then at 01:07:55.630, Chanu
placed a 100-lot Spoof Order 2 ticks away from the best offer to sell June delivery Gold Futures
at $1374.60, which he intended to cancel before execution.

47. Just before placing the 100-lot Spoof Order, the visible volume on the offer side
was 62 contracts with no price level exceeding 15 contracts. Chanu’s 100-lot offer more than
doubled the visible volume on the offer side and almost doubled the visible bid volume.

A8. Chanu’s 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1374.10 was filled approximately 1.2
seconds after the placement of his 100-lot Spoof Order to sell, after pending in the market for
over 2 minutes.

49. At 01:07:57.865, a half second after filling his Genuine Order, Chanu cancelled
his 100-lot Spoof Order in its entirety.

3. June 2, 2013 Spoofing

50. On June 2, 2013, at 19:52:13.056, Chanu placed a 50-lot Genuine Order that was
an Iceberg Order showing 1 lot to the market to sell August-delivery Gold Futures at $1395.60.
At the time of placement, the Genuine Order was at the best price level.

51. The Genuine Order sat pending for over 3 minutes, at which point Chanu placed a
100-lot Spoof Order to buy August-delivery Gold Futures at $1395.3 that he intended to cancel

before execution.

volume was 116 lots. His Spoof Order, therefore, increased the visible sell-side volume by
almost 50%.

54. Almost immediately, Chanu’s Genuine Order filled 3 contracts.

55. Approximately | second later, Chanu cancelled his 100-lot Spoof Order in its
entirety.

4. July 9, 2013 Spoofing

56. On July 9, 2013, at 15:51:59.661, Vorley placed a 50-lot Genuine Order as an
Iceberg Order showing | lot to the market, to sell Gold Futures at $1247.00.

57. Almost immediately, 10 lots of the sell order filled. Then approximately 5
seconds passed without further fills, so Vorley placed a 100-lot Spoof Order to buy Gold Futures
at $1246.80 that he intended to cancel before execution.

58. At the time the Spoof Order was placed, the market was slightly imbalanced, with
58% more bids than offers. As a result of the Spoof Order, the market became one where the
Order Book had 207% more bids than offers.

59. Almost immediately after the Spoof Order to buy was placed, within 3
