THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
YOOES220SS Hoccunaeat2Ss1 Ail#ecOGSI27220 Aeaiecccobi22

 

A. FINDINGS OF FACT

The Parties to This Consent Order
17. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and the
Regulations.
18. Defendant Eyal Alper is an individual who resides in Tarrytown, New York.

Alper has never been registered with the CFTC.

Defendant Fraudulently Solicited Customers

19. From at least late 2015 through October 2019 (the “Relevant Period”), Alper
solicited at least thirteen (13) customers to trade futures contracts and/or retail forex through
accounts managed by him. Alper’s solicitations occurred primarily in telephone conversations
with customers; however, in some instances, Alper met face-to-face with customers.

20. During the course of his solicitations, Alper stated or implied to customers that he
was an experienced and successful trader. He told at least one customer that he had been trading
for five to seven years and that after losing money early in his career, he had not had a down
month in many years and that he had experienced double digit growth. He stated to another
customer that he had taken an account of approximately $40,000 and grown that into $400,000.

21. In fact, Alper had not had an active or even a funded futures or retail forex trading
account at any domestic futures commission merchant (“FCM”) or retail foreign exchange dealer
(“RFED”) since at least as far back as January 2014.

22. — Alper also stated or implied to customers that he controlled a large-dollar trading

account at FxPro, a UK-based trading firm; he told some customers that the account was over $1

1.
Geasd/71Poerv0GSS22C5S Doocunaat2231 AlbecOSS027220 Feagesoob222

million. Alper told customers that because of the size of his account, he was able to open sub-
accounts on their behalf under his master account.

23. In fact, Alper never had an account or any subaccounts at FxPro, and it has been
the policy at FxPro since 2010 not to accept accounts from U.S. customers.

24. — Alper told customers that if they invested their money with him, he would put that
money into a sub-account under his master account at FxPro and trade futures contracts and/or
retail forex on a discretionary basis on their behalf. Alper said that he would charge a
commission of approximately thirty percent (30%) of any profits achieved. In addition, Alper
offered at least some customers a cash bonus on top of their profits if they kept their money with
Alper for at least six months.

25. On the basis of Alper’s representations, at least thirteen customers sent money to
Alper to trade on their behalf during the Relevant Period. Alper instructed customers to send
their funds not to FxPro, but directly to him, via check, wire, bank transfer, or direct deposit.
Customers’ funds were deposited to bank accounts controlled by Alper.

26. In soliciting customers, Alper made no attempt to determine if they were eligible
contract participants (“ECPs”) under Section 1a(18)(A)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18)(A)(xi)

(2018). In fact, most, if not all, of Alper’s customers were not ECPs.

Defendant Misappropriated Customer Funds

27. Alper never transferred any of the funds received from his customers into
subaccounts at FxPro or into accounts at any domestic FCM or RFED for trading futures or retail
forex. Contrary to the representations made to his customers, Alper misappropriated his
customers’ funds and used them to pay for his personal expenses. For example, during the

Relevant Period, Alper made numerous cash withdrawals from a bank account into which
Gaeed/71PecrvOSS32205S Mipocuneat2esl AlbecOGS027220 Heage7/ob222

customer funds had been deposited, as well as numerous transfers from that account to his
personal bank account. In addition, Alper used the funds in that bank account to pay for, among
other things, international travel, restaurants, and car rentals.

28. — Specifically, Alper misappropriated $352,901.03 of customers’ funds and used
these funds to pay personal expenses, including, among other things, international travel,

restaurants, and car rentals.

Defendant Issued False Statements to Customers

29. To conceal his misappropriation, Alper sent false statements to his customers
which purported to show that their accounts were making profits. These statements consisted of
screenshots sent to customers via text message which purported to show the customer’s balance,
equity, margin level, and gains/losses on various trades of futures contracts and/or retail forex.
The statements did not contain the name of FxPro on them; nor did they contain an account
number. Indeed, Alper never provided his customers with their account numbers. The
statements were not dated; nor did they provide the date on which the purported trades listed
‘were made.

30. Despite the fact that no customer funds were ever transferred to FxPro, the
statements sent to customers showed that their accounts were making profits. On the basis of
these false statements, Alper calculated and claimed his commission from his customers. Rather
than take his commission from the purported profits made by his customers’ accounts, Alper
convinced some of his customers to send additional funds to his bank account to pay his
commission. During the Relevant Period, Alper received $352,901.03 from customers in

principal and commission payments.
Geasd/71Poerv0OSS22C5S Doocunaet22s1 AlbecOSs027220 Feaecseob222

When Customers Sought to Withdraw Funds from Their Accounts,

Defendant Made Further Misrepresentations to Cover Up His
Misappropriation

31. At various times during the Relevant Period, at least nine customers sought to
withdraw funds from their accounts. In some instances, Alper failed to respond at all to a
customer’s request. In other instances, Alper responded with various false excuses as to why he
could not immediately comply with the request. Among the excuses that Alper made to
customers as to why he could not comply with their withdrawal requests were that: (1) the
Securities and Exchange Commission was auditing his books; (2) his accounts were frozen; and
(3) the money was stuck overseas. Alper continued either to ignore customers’ withdrawal
requests or to make excuses to customers until they gave up on getting their money back. Alper
has never returned any money to any of these nine customers in response to their requests for
withdrawals.

B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Jurisdiction and Venue

 

32. The Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2018), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission
that any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting
a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, the

33. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2018), because Alper resides in this jurisdiction and certain transactions, acts, and
practices alleged in the Complaint occurred, are occurring, and/or are about to occur within this

District.

futures contracts pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) (2018).

36. 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b)(1)-(3) makes it unlawful for any person, by use of the mails or

person, or (3) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive another person by any means whatsoever

in connection with any retail forex transaction.

(b) making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts to

(i) he was an experienced and successful trader;
(ii) he controlled a large-dollar trading account at FxPro, where

all in connection with futures contracts and/or retail forex transactions, including the purported
trading of futures contracts and/or retail forex transactions conducted or to be conducted by
Alper on behalf of his customers, in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 17 C.F.R.

§ 5.2(b)(1) and (3).
b. Fraud by False Statements

38. By the conduct described above, Alper willfully or recklessly issued or caused to

be issued false statements to customers that disguised his misappropriation of funds and

10
Gaeed/71 Pecrv0SS8a20SS MpocuneateEsl AlbecOGS027220 Heagelllobh22

misrepresented the profitability and value of customers’ accounts, in violation of 7 U.S.C.

§ 6b(a)(2)(B) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b)(2).

Violations of Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. & 60(1)(A) and (B)
(2018)

39. 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A) and (B), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for a commodity
trading advisor (“CTA”), by use of the mails or any other means or instrumentality of interstate
commerce, directly or indirectly, to: (A) employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any
customer; or (B) engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business that operates as a
fraud or deceit upon any customer.

40. 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A) and (B) applies to CTAs engaging in retail forex transactions
pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C)(ii) and (vii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)(ii), (vii) (2018).

41. 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A) and (B) appiies to all CTAs, whether registered, required to
be registered, or exempted from registration.

42. Section 1a(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(12) (2018), defines a CTA as any person
who for compensation or profit, engages in the business of advising others as to the value or
advisability of trading in, among other things, futures contracts or retail forex transactions.
Similarly, Regulation 5.1(e)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(e)(1) (2019), defines a CTA as “any person who
exercises discretionary trading authority or obtains written authorization to exercise discretionary
trading authority over any account for or on behalf of any person that is not an [ECP] in
connection with retail forex transactions.”

43. In the case of an individual, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18)(A)(xi) defines an ECP to mean a
person “acting for its own account . . . who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the

aggregate of which is in excess of — (I) $10,000,000; or (II) $5,000,000 and who enters into the

il
Gaeed/71 PecrvOSS8a205S MpocuneateEsl AlbecOGSI27220 Heagel ba0bk22

agreement, contract, or transaction in order to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual.”

44. — By the conduct described above, Alper acted as a CTA as defined in part by
7U.S.C. § 1a(12) (2018), in that, for compensation or profit, he engaged in the business of
advising others as to the value or advisability of trading in, among other things, futures contracts
or retail forex transactions. Similarly, by the conduct described above, Alper acted as a CTA as
defined by Regulation 5.1(¢)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(e)(1) (2019), in that he exercised discretionary
trading authority or obtained written authorization to exercise discretionary trading authority
over accounts for or on behalf of persons who were not ECPs in connection with retail forex
transactions.

45, As set forth above, Alper, while acting as CTA, through use of the mails or other
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, directly or indirectly employed a device,
scheme, or artifice to defraud customers and engaged in transactions, practices, or courses of
business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon customers, by among other things:

(a) misappropriating customers’ funds;
(b) making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts to
prospective and actual customers; and
(c) making, causing to be made, and distributing reports or statements to
customers that contained false information,
all in connection with the purported trading of futures contracts and/or retail forex transactions
conducted or to be conducted by Alper on behalf of his customers, in violation of 7 U.S.C.

§ 60(1)(A) and (B).
Gaeed/71 Pecrv0SS3a205S MpocuneateEsl AlbecOGSI27220 Heagel Boobh22

Violation of Regulation 4.36(a), 17 C.F.R. § 4.30(a) (2019)

46. 17 C.E.R. § 4.30(a) prohibits a CTA, whether registered, required to be registered,
or exempted from registration, from soliciting, accepting, or receiving from an existing or
prospective customer funds in the CTA’s name to purchase, margin, or guarantee any
commodity interest of the customer.

47. By the conduct described above, Alper violated 17 C.F.R. § 4.30(a), in that he
solicited, accepted, and received funds from customers in his own name for the purpose of
purchasing, margining, guaranteeing, or securing futures contracts and/or retail forex contracts

fog them.

Need for Injunction
48. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Alper will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in similar

acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
49. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to Section 6c
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2018), Alper is permanently restrained, enjoined, and prohibited

4.14(a)(9), 17 CF.R. § 4.14(a)(9) (2019).

Vv. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
A. Restitution

51. Alper shall pay restitution in the amount of three hundred fifty-two thousand, nine
hundred one dollars and three cents ($352,901.03) (“Restitution Obligation”), representing the
customer losses that he caused through misappropriation of customer funds in connection with
such violations, plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the
Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be
determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2018).

32. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to customers by Alper, the Court appoints the National Futures Association
(“NFA”) as Monitor (“Monitor”). The Monitor shall receive restitution payments from Alper
and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this
Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising
from NFA’s appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

53. Alper shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order to the

Monitor in the name “Eyal Alper Restitution Fund” and shall send such Restitution Obligation

15
Gaeed/71 Pecrv0SS3a205S Mpocuneateeel AlbecOGSI27220 Heagel Beobh22

payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank
cashier’s check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under cover letter
that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Alper
shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief
Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st
Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

54. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to participants
identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems
appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are
of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a
distribution to eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such
restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the
Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in Part V.
B. below.

55. Alper shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such information
as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify the customers to whom the Monitor,
in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of any Restitution
Obligation payments. Alper shall execute any documents necessary to release funds that he has
in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in order to

make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

57. The amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any customer
from proving that a greater amount is owed from Alper or any other person or entity, and nothing
herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any participant that exist
under state or common law.

58. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each customer of
Alper who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this Consent
Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of any
portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Alper to ensure continued compliance with
any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Alper in contempt for any violations of any
provision of this Consent Order.

59. To the extent that any funds acerue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of Alper’s
Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement in
accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty

60. Alper shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of three hundred fifty-two
thousand, nine hundred one dollars and three cents ($352,901.03) (“CMP Obligation”), plus
post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on
the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate

prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2018).
