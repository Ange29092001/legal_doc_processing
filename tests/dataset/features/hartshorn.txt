5. No Further Charges

If the Court accepts this plea agreement, the United States

binding on the Court, and if not accepted by the Court, the defendant will not be

complies with the provisions of USSG §3E1.1 (b) and all terms of this Plea

Court, and if not accepted by the Court, the defendant will not be allowed to

withdraw from the plea.

Defendant’s Initials pe
Cas@ aa. ce0602 BG ESE DocimentiinFiéd. 0 H24t205/Pagé6 1 Paja 1 Pagal 14

defense; but, by pleading guilty, defendant waives or gives up those rights and
there will be no trial. The defendant further understands that if defendant pleads
guilty, the Court may ask defendant questions about the offense or offenses to
which defendant pleaded, and if defendant answers those questions under cath,
on the record, and in the presence of counsel (if any), defendant's answers may
later be used against defendant in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.
The defendant also understands that defendant will be adjudicated guilty of the
offenses to which defendant has pleaded and, if any of such offenses are felonies,
may thereby be deprived of certain rights, such as the right to vote, to hold public
office, to serve on a jury, or to have possession of firearms.
11. Factual Basis

Defendant is pleading guilty because defendant is in fact guilty. The
defendant certifies that defendant does hereby admit that the facts set forth below
are true, and were this case to go to trial, the United States would be able to prove
those specific facts and others beyond a reasonable doubt.

FACTS

From 2007 to in or around 2014 (the “Relevant Period”), Hartshom
fraudulently solicited numerous clients to invest in off-exchange foreign currency

ona leveraged, margined, or financed basis (“forex” or “foreign currency”).

i

Defendant's Initials 4 att
Cas@ 520. 0602 BG EH SER DocimentiinFiéd 0 H24/205/ PAGS 1 Pat Pagalp 15

During the Relevant Period, Hartshom fraudulently solicited more than
$900,000 from at least 13 individuals, Hartshorn accumulated trading losses of
over $794,000 for clients, and he received commissions totaling more than
$112,000 in connection with the fraud. Hartshorn also misappropriated more
than $57,000 of client funds.

Hartshorn typically met his victims at church or socially in his local
community. Hartshorn willfully told his clients, falsely, that he had successfully
traded foreign currency for both himself and others, but he never disclosed to
clients that he had actually suffered losses — often large single-day losses — when
trading foreign currency on behalf of other clients.

Hartshorn also willfully told clients, falsely, that he would trade their funds
in a manner te limit the risk of loss, failing to disclose his actual pattern and
history of employing risky trading strategies and incurring trading losses on behalf
of clients.

Often, Hartshorn engaged in trading strategies that resulted in margin calls
in client accounts because the account equity became too low to support the
margin requirement for open positions resulting from trades placed by Hartshorn.
‘When these margin calls occurred, the margin calls resulted in the liquidation of

open trades and the realization of trading losses.

12

Defendant's Initials he
Cas@ aa. 0602 BG EH SER DocimentiinFiéd 0 H2ai205/PAag6 1 Pat Pagap 16

Hartshorn entered into a purported “profit” sharing arrangement with
clients but failed to disclose to clients that under that arrangement, Hartshorn
could earn fees even as the clients’ forex investments incurred losses.

Hartshorn willfully told multiple clients, falsely, that their accounts were
performing profitably when Hartshorn knew that the clients’ funds had been
depleted by trading losses, fees, and withdrawals by Hartshorn into Hartshorn’s
personal bank account.

Hartshorn knew that all of the false statements referred to above were false
at the time he made them to clients, and those statements were material in that a
reasonable investor would have considered the statements important in deciding
whether to invest.

In addition, Hartshorn misappropriated for his own personal benefit funds
that had been entrusted to him by clients for the purpose of trading forex.
Hartshom never disclosed this misappropriation to his clients.

Hartshom, for compensation or profit, advised others as to the value or
advisability of trading forex and exercised discretionary trading authority over
accounts for or on behalf of his individual clients in connection with retail forex
transactions. Hartshorn held himself out to the public as a commodity trading
advisor, including by soliciting clients to use their funds to trade foreign currency

and to give Hartshorn discretionary authority to trade forex on their behalf.

Cas@ asa: 0602 BG EH SEP DocimentiinFiéd 0 H2a205/ Pag 1 Pat Pagal 17

Nevertheless, Hartshorn has never been registered with the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in any capacity (nor was he
eligible for any registration exemption) and has not distributed disclosure
documents to clients as required by CFTC Regulation 431,17 C.F.R. § 4.31. In
addition, Hartshorn solicited, accepted, or received funds from clients in
Hartshorn's name, and failed to produce certain required records to the CFTC in
violation of CFTC recordkeeping regulations.

None of the individual clients solicited by Hartshorn were eligible contract
participants, as defined by Section 1a(18)(A){xi) of the Commodity Exchange
Act, 7 U.S.C. § La(18)(A)(xi).

On November 7, 2018, Hartshorn was interviewed by agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

In that interview, Hartshorn stated that investor funds were always placed
in their respective investment account by the investor.

Hartshorn further stated that while he had direct access to investor
accounts for trading, he never had the ability to withdraw any of those funds for
personal use.

Hartshorn further stated that he never misappropriated any investor

money.

Defendant's Initials 27
_ Casé asad: ce0s02 Bc AS2R CocimentiinFiéd 0 H2ai205/ Page 1 Pagal Page 18

Moreover, Hartshorn stated that he never used any investor money for
personal reasons.

These statements to the FBI were willful and materially false.

In fact, multiple clients entrusted Hartshorn with their funds for the
purpose of trading foreign currency, rather than placing the funds in their own
respective trading accounts.

Furthermore, Hartshorn placed the funds that had been entrusted to him by
multiple clients into his personal bank account (and transferred the funds or a
portion thereof into his personal trading account); consequently, Hartshorn did
have the ability to withdraw those funds for personal use.

Moreover, Hartshorn did misappropriate the funds of certain clients.

12. Entire Agreement

This plea agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
government and the defendant with respect to the aforementioned guilty plea and
