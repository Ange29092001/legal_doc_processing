       "   'SUMMARY l. Beginning as early as January 2012, Joshua Gilliland and Chawalit Wongkhiao, individually and as principals of Allied Markets LLC (“Allied Markets”) (collectively “Defendants”), have engaged in a fraudulent scheme to solicit more than $1 million from members of the public to participate in a supposed commodity pool purportedly trading leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly known as “forex.” 2 As part of this illegal scheme, Defendants misappropriated pool participants’ funds to pay Gilliland’s and Wongkhiao’s personal expenses.',\n",
       "   'Gilliland and Wongkhiao treated pool participants’ funds as their personal bank account, spending pool participants’ money on restaurants, entertainment, and living expenses.',\n",

       "   'Defendants made material misrepresentations regarding their trading expertise and profits, and they failed to disclose to prospective and existing pool participants that only a small portion of their funds would be used to trade forex, while the rest would be misappropriated to pay Gilliland’s and Wongkhiao’s personal expenses and to further Defendants’ fraudulent scheme.',\n",
       "   '4.',\n",
