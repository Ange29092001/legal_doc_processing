Case No. 3:15-cv-5-J-34MCR U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, Plaintiff, ALLIED MARKETS LLC, JOSHUA GILLILAND, and CHAWALIT WONGKHIAO, Defendants. ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S EX PARTE MOTION FOR STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER AND SCHEDULING PRELIMINARY fNJUNCTION HEARING THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiffs Ex Parte Motion for Statutory Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. S-4; Motion), filed on January 5, 2015. Simultaneously with the Motion, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Plaintiff or CFTC) filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief (Doc. S-3) against Defendants Allied Markets LLC, Joshua Gilliland, and Chawalit Wongkhiao (collectively, Defendants). In the Motion, the CFTC moves, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l (a) (2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets and prohibiting the destruction of books, records, or other documents; and for an order requiring Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the CFTC's Motion, and now, being fully advised, finds as follows: 1. The Court possesses jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this action pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a- l (2012). 2. Venue properly lies in this District, pursuant to Section 6c( e) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l(e) (2012). 3. There is good cause to believe that Defendant Allied Markets LLC (\"Allied Markets\"), by and through its agents, principals and control persons, Defendants Joshua Gilliland and Chawalit Wongkhiao have engaged in, are engaging in, and may continue to engage in violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(l), and 4o(l) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 6k(2), 6m(l), 60(1) (2012); and CFTC Regulations 3. 12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.4l(a), 5.2(b)(l) and (3), 5.3(a)(2)(i), and 5.3(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. §§ 3.12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.4l(a), 5.2(b)(l), (3), 5.3(a)(2)(i), (ii) (2014). 4. The CFTC has presented evidence that, since at least January 2012, Defendants fraudulently solicited more than $1 million from members of the public to participate in a supposed commodity pool purportedly trading leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly known as \"forex.\" The CFTC has also presented evidence that Defendants misappropriated pool participants' funds to pay Defendants Gilliland's and Wongkhiao's personal expenses. Additionally, the CFTC has presented evidence that Defendants failed to register with the CFTC as required, failed to segregate customer funds, and failed to operate the commodity pool as a separate entity, and 2 failed to accurately report or disclose the performance of the relevant investments, as required by the CEA and CFTC Regulations. 5. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the Court's ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by order of this Court; 6. There is good cause for entry of an order freezing assets owned, controlled, managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, Defendants. 7. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of the CFTC immediate and complete access to Defendants' books and records for inspection and copying. 8. Absent the entry of this order, Defendants would have the ability to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy books and records. 9. An ex parte statutory restraining order is warranted here to preserve the status quo, protect customers from loss and damage, and enable the CFTC to fulfill its statutory duties. Accordingly, it is ORDERED: 10. Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for Statutory Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. S-4) is GRANTED, in part, and TAKEN UNDER ADVISEMENT, in part. 3 A. To the extent the CFTC requests an ex parte statutory restraining order, the Motion is GRANTED as set forth below. B.

In issuing this Statutory Restraining Order, the Court understands that Defendants have not yet been given an opportunity to be heard and emphasizes that it is not making a final decision on any request for preliminary injunctive relief. However, the Court is persuaded that issuing the Statutory Restraining Order until a full hearing can be held on the CFTC's request for preliminary injunctive relief is the lawful and proper action. 5 McDonald's Com. v. Robertson, 147 F.3d 1301, 1312-13 (I Ith Cir. 1998) (\"[W]here facts are bitterly contested and credibility determinations must be made to decide whether injunctive relief should issue, an evidentiary hearing must be held ....

The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the CFTC's Motion, and now, being fully advised, finds as follows: 1.

Venue properly lies in this District, pursuant to Section 6c( e) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l(e) (2012). 3.

Case No. 3:15-cv-5-J-34MCR U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, Plaintiff, ALLIED MARKETS LLC, JOSHUA GILLILAND, and CHAWALIT WONGKHIAO, Defendants. ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S EX PARTE MOTION FOR STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER AND SCHEDULING PRELIMINARY fNJUNCTION HEARING THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiffs Ex Parte Motion for Statutory Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. S-4; Motion), filed on January 5, 2015. Simultaneously with the Motion, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Plaintiff or CFTC) filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief (Doc. S-3) against Defendants Allied Markets LLC, Joshua Gilliland, and Chawalit Wongkhiao (collectively, Defendants). In the Motion, the CFTC moves, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l (a) (2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets and prohibiting the destruction of books, records, or other documents; and for an order requiring Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the CFTC's Motion, and now, being fully advised, finds as follows: 1. The Court possesses jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this action pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a- l (2012). 2. Venue properly lies in this District, pursuant to Section 6c( e) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l(e) (2012). 3. There is good cause to believe that Defendant Allied Markets LLC (\"Allied Markets\"), by and through its agents, principals and control persons, Defendants Joshua Gilliland and Chawalit Wongkhiao have engaged in, are engaging in, and may continue to engage in violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(l), and 4o(l) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 6k(2), 6m(l), 60(1) (2012); and CFTC Regulations 3. 12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.4l(a), 5.2(b)(l) and (3), 5.3(a)(2)(i), and 5.3(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. §§ 3.12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.4l(a), 5.2(b)(l), (3), 5.3(a)(2)(i), (ii) (2014). 4. The CFTC has presented evidence that, since at least January 2012, Defendants fraudulently solicited more than $1 million from members of the public to participate in a supposed commodity pool purportedly trading leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly known as \"forex.\" The CFTC has also presented evidence that Defendants misappropriated pool participants' funds to pay Defendants Gilliland's and Wongkhiao's personal expenses. Additionally, the CFTC has presented evidence that Defendants failed to register with the CFTC as required, failed to segregate customer funds, and failed to operate the commodity pool as a separate entity, and 2 failed to accurately report or disclose the performance of the relevant investments, as required by the CEA and CFTC Regulations. 5. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the Court's ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by order of this Court; 6. There is good cause for entry of an order freezing assets owned, controlled, managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, Defendants. 7. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of the CFTC immediate and complete access to Defendants' books and records for inspection and copying. 8. Absent the entry of this order, Defendants would have the ability to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy books and records. 9. An ex parte statutory restraining order is warranted here to preserve the status quo, protect customers from loss and damage, and enable the CFTC to fulfill its statutory duties. Accordingly, it is ORDERED: 10. Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for Statutory Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. S-4) is GRANTED, in part, and TAKEN UNDER ADVISEMENT, in part. 3 A. To the extent the CFTC requests an ex parte statutory restraining order, the Motion is GRANTED as set forth below. B.

Robertson, 147 F.3d 1301, 1312-13 (I Ith Cir. 1998) (\"[W]here facts are bitterly contested and credibility determinations must be made to decide whether injunctive relief should issue, an evidentiary hearing must be held .... [W]here material facts are not in dispute, or where facts in dispute are not material to the preliminary injunction sought, district courts need not hold an evidentiary hearing.\") In the event either party believes such a hearing is warranted in this action, the party must, after conferring with opposing counsel, file a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing and identifying the factual issues or dispute which necessitate such relief. 8 VIII.
